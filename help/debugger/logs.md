The Logs tab shows information in four columns:

**[!UICONTROL Solutions]:** Displays icons for the Experience Cloud solution affected by the logged item. Hover over the icon for a text description.

**[!UICONTROL Occurred at]:** Shows when the logged issue occured during the session.

**[!UICONTROL Log level]:** Shows the issue severity. The severity is one of the following levels: 

* Log
* Info
* Warnings
* Errors

**[!UICONTROL Log message]:** Describes the issue.

Some log messages include a Show Code option. Select **[!UICONTROL Show Code]** to view the conditional code that determines whether a rule should fire. 

To clear the log, select **[!UICONTROL Remove Logs]**.
