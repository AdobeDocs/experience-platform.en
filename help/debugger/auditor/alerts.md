# Alert test reference

This reference provides more information about how the auditor feature in Adobe Experience Platform Debugger runs alert tests.

Alerts show issues you should be aware of, but that don't affect your score. These are best practice recommendations that, in some cases, may not apply to your implementation.

| Test | Weight | Criteria | Recommendation |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Advertising Cloud - Correct Conversion Tag Implemented | 0 | Check whether the correct conversion tag is used.<br><br>**Warning**: Using the deprecated TubeMogul conversion tags can result in data loss. | Upgrade your conversion pixels to the new Advertising Cloud image-only conversion tags. This can be most easily accomplished with the [Advertising Cloud tag extension](../../destinations/catalog/advertising/adobe-advertising-cloud.md). |
| Advertising Cloud - Correct JS Tag Used | 0 | Advertising Cloud should use the latest JavaScript tags. | Upgrade your Advertising Cloud JavaScript to the latest version. Using the deprecated JavaScript versions can result in lost functionality. This can be accomplished more easily through the use of the [Advertising Cloud tag extension](../../destinations/catalog/advertising/adobe-advertising-cloud.md). |
| Advertising Cloud - Image-only tag | 0 | The Advertising Cloud image pixel format should match one of the following recommended formats: <ul><li>`http(s)://rtd.tubemogul.com/upi/?sid=<HASH_VALUE>`</li><li>`http(s)://rtd-tm.everesttech.net/upi/?sid=<HASH_VALUE>`</li><li>`http(s)://pixel.everesttech.net/px2/<NUMERIC_ID>?`</li></ul> | Upgrade your Advertising Cloud pixels to the new Advertising Cloud image-only tags, which ensure you are taking advantage of the full Advertising Cloud functionality. This can be most easily accomplished with the [Advertising Cloud tag extension](../../destinations/catalog/advertising/adobe-advertising-cloud.md). |
| Advertising Cloud - Segment Pixels DSP Syncing Enabled | 0 | Check whether the TubeMogul segment pixel contains a DSP Syncing setting, and recommend that the setting be added to the pixel. The DSP Syncing setting is determined by the use of a query string parameter. To summarize: <ul><li>IF the tag is being fired to any of the following:<ul><li>`https://rtd.tubemogul.com/upi/?sid=<HASH_VALUE>`</li><li>`http(s)://rtd-tm.everesttech.net/upi/?sid=<HASH_VALUE>`</li><li>`http(s)://pixel.everesttech.net/px2/<NUMERIC_ID>?`</li></ul></li><li>AND the tag contains the URL parameter `sid=`</li><li>THEN check to see if the URL parameter `cs=0` or `cs=1` exists, and if not recommend that `cs=1` be added to those pixels so that the audience match rates can improve.</li></ul> | Add the URL parameter `cs=1` to your Advertising Cloud pixels so that DSP Syncing can occur, which increases audience match rates. This can most easily be accomplished with the [Advertising Cloud tag extension](../../destinations/catalog/advertising/adobe-advertising-cloud.md). |
| Experience Cloud ID Service - Use only one AdobeOrg | 0 | In a normal ECID implementation, a single AdobeOrg should be used. | Validate that multiple AdobeOrg IDs exist for this implementation. <br><br>[Additional information](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/id-service/using/intro/id-request.html) |
| Launch - `pageBottom` callback placement | 0 | The `_satellite.pageBottom()` function must be present in order for tags to work. Add the inline script immediately prior to the closing `</body>` tag to ensure proper DTM functionality. Note: It is best practice that the tag be the last tag in the `<body>`. If it's found within the `<body>` tag, it has a chance of functioning, but as it is not best practice, it could function incorrectly or with unexpected or undesired results. | Add the inline script immediately prior to the closing `</body>` tag to ensure proper DTM functionality. <br><br>[Additional information](../../tags/ui/client-side/asynchronous-deployment.md) |
| Launch - Self-Hosted | 0 | The tag library is being hosted on Adobe's Akamai instance at `assets.adobedtm.com`. Self-hosting is the recommended approach for loading tags because it provides greater control of website performance through cache control, reducing third-party script dependencies, and greater control of the publishing process. Tag libraries can be hosted and managed through your own web hosting or CDN. | Switch to a self-hosting is approach for loading tags on a page. Although hosting via the Akamai CDN works in most cases, self-hosting improves page performance. <br><br>Additional information:<ul><li>[Tags quickstart guide](../../tags/ui/client-side/asynchronous-deployment.md)</li><li>[Asynchronous deployment](../../tags/ui/client-side/asynchronous-deployment.md)</li></ul> |
| Launch - should be asynchronously deployed | 0 | Tags should be asynchronously deployed for optimal performance. | Include the `async` parameter in the inline script to ensure proper tags functionality <br><br>[Additional information](../../tags/ui/client-side/asynchronous-deployment.md) |
| Target - Content in `mboxDefault` | 0 | Content should exist in `mboxDefault` when using `at.js`. | Verify that the content is available. <br><br>[Additional information](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/target/using/implement-target/implementing-target.html) |
