# Test an Adobe Target implementation with Adobe Experience Platform Debugger

Adobe Experience Platform Debugger provides a suite of useful tools for testing and debugging a website that has been tooled with an Adobe Target implementation. This guide covers some common workflows and best practices for using Platform Debugger on a Target-enabled website.

## Prerequisites

To use Platform Debugger for Target, the website must be using the [at.js library](https://developer.adobe.com/target/implement/client-side/atjs/how-atjs-works/) version 1.x or higher. Previous versions are not supported.

## Initializing Platform Debugger

Open the website you want to test in a browser, and then open the Platform Debugger extension.

Select **[!DNL Target]** in the left navigation. If Platform Debugger detects that a compatible version of at.js is running on the site, Adobe Target implementation details are shown.

## Global configuration information

Information about the implementation's global configuration is displayed at the top of the Target view in Platform Debugger.

![Global configuration information for Target highlighted within Platform Debugger](../images/solutions/target/global-config.png)

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Client Code | A unique ID that identifies your organization.|
| Version | The version of the Adobe Target library currently installed on the website.|
| Global Request Name | The name of the [global mbox](https://developer.adobe.com/target/implement/client-side/atjs/global-mbox/global-mbox-overview/?) for the Target implementation, the default name being `target-global-mbox`. |
| Page Load Event | A boolean value indicating whether a [page load event](https://developer.adobe.com/target/implement/client-side/atjs/how-atjs-works/how-atjs-works/#atjs-2x-diagrams) has taken place. Page load events are only supported for at.js 2.x. For non-compatible versions, this value defaults to `None`.|

## [!DNL Network Requests] {#network}

Select **[!DNL Network Requests]** to view summary information on each network request made on the page.

![The [!DNL Network Requests] section for Target selected within Platform Debugger](../images/solutions/target/network-requests.png)

As you perform actions on the page (including reloading the page), new columns are automatically added to the table, allowing you to view the sequence of actions and how values are altered between each request.
