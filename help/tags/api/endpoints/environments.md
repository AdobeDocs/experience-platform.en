# Environments endpoint

When a [library](./libraries.md) is compiled into a [build](./builds.md) in the Reactor API, the exact contents of the build depend upon the environment settings and the resources included in the library. Specifically, the environment determines the following:

1. **Destination**: The location where you want the build to be deployed. This is controlled by selecting a [host](./hosts.md) for the environment to use.
1. **Archive**: You can choose to retrieve the build as a deployable set of files or have it zipped up in an archive format. This is controlled by the `archive` setting on the environment.

The destination and archive format configured by the environment changes how you reference the build in your application (that reference being an [embed code](../../ui/publishing/environments.md#embed-code)). If you make any changes to destination or file format, you must make a matching update to your application to use the new reference.

Environments come in three types (or stages), with each type having a different limit to the total number you can have:

| Environment Type | Allowed Number |
| --- | --- |
| Development | (No limit) |
| Staging | One |
| Production | One |

{style="table-layout:auto"}

These environment types have similar behavior, but are used at different stages of the [tag publishing workflow](../../ui/publishing/publishing-flow.md).

An environment belongs to exactly one [property](./properties.md).

For more general information on environments, see the section on [environments](../../ui/publishing/environments.md) in the publishing docs.

## Getting started

The endpoint used in this guide is part of the [Reactor API](https://www.adobe.io/experience-platform-apis/references/reactor/). Before continuing, please review the [getting started guide](../getting-started.md) for important information regarding how to authenticate to the API.

## Retrieve a list of environments {#list}

You can retrieve a list of environments for a property by including the property's ID in the path of a GET request.

**API format**

```http
GET /properties/{PROPERTY_ID}/environments
```

| Parameter | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `PROPERTY_ID` | The `id` of the property that owns the environments. |

{style="table-layout:auto"}

>[!NOTE]
>
>Using query parameters, listed environments can be filtered based on the following attributes:<ul><li>`archive`</li><li>`created_at`</li><li>`name`</li><li>`stage`</li><li>`token`</li><li>`updated_at`</li></ul>See the guide on [filtering responses](../guides/filtering.md) for more information.

**Request**

```shell
curl -X GET \
  https://reactor.adobe.io/properties/PR97d92a379a5f48758947cdf44f607a0d/environments \
