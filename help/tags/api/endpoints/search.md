# Search endpoint

The `/search` endpoint in the Reactor API provides a way to find resources matching desired criteria, expressed as a query.

The following API resource types are searchable, utilizing the same data structure as the resource-based documents returned across the API:

* `audit_events`
* `builds`
* `callbacks`
* `data_elements`
* `environments`
* `extension_packages`
* `extensions`
* `hosts`
* `libraries`
* `properties`
* `rule_components`
* `rules`

All queries are scoped to the your current company and accessible properties.

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>The search functionality has the following caveats and exceptions:
>* meta is not searchable and not returned in search results.
>* Schema fields for extension package delegates (actions, conditions, etc.) are searchable as text, not as a nested data structure.
>* Range queries presently only support integers.

For more in-depth information on how to use this functionality, refer to the [searching guide](../guides/search.md).

## Getting started

The endpoint used in this guide is part of the [Reactor API](https://www.adobe.io/apis/experienceplatform/home/api-reference.html#!acpdr/swagger-specs/reactor.yaml). Before continuing, please review the [getting started guide](../getting-started.md) for important information regarding how to authenticate to the API.

## Retrieve a list of rules {#list}

You can retrieve a list of rules belonging to a property by including by making a GET request.

**API format**

```http
GET /properties/{PROPERTY_ID}/rules
```

| Parameter | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `PROPERTY_ID` | The `id` of the property whose components you want to list. |

{style="table-layout:auto"}

>[!NOTE]
>
>Using query parameters, listed rules can be filtered based on the following attributes:<ul><li>`created_at`</li><li>`dirty`</li><li>`enabled`</li><li>`name`</li><li>`origin_id`</li><li>`published`</li><li>`published_at`</li><li>`revision_number`</li><li>`updated_at`</li></ul>See the guide on [filtering responses](../guides/filtering.md) for more information.

| Property | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `from` | The number of results to offset the response by. |
| `size` | The maximum amount of results to return. Results cannot exceed 100 items. |
| `query` | An object that represents the search query. For each property in this object, the key must represent a field path to query by, and the value must be an object whose sub-properties determine what to query for.<br><br>For each field path, you can use the following sub-properties:<ul><li>`exists`: Returns true if the field exists in the resource.</li><li>`value`: Returns true if the field's value matches the value of this property.</li><li>`value_operator`: Boolean logic used to determine how a `value` query should handled. Allowed values are `AND` and `OR`. When excluded, `AND` logic is assumed. See the section on [value operator logic](#value-operator) for more information.</li><li>`range` Returns true if the field's value falls within a specific numerical range. The range itself is determined by the following sub-properties:<ul><li>`gt`: Greater than the supplied value, non-inclusive.</li><li>`gte`: Greater than or equal to the supplied value.</li><li>`lt`: Less than the supplied value, non-inclusive.</li><li>`lte`: Less than or equal to the supplied value.</li></ul></li></ul> |
| `sort` | An array of objects, indicating the order in which to sort results. Each object must contain a single property: the key represents the field path to sort by, and the value represents the sort order (`asc` for ascending, `desc` for descending). |
| `resource_types` | An array of strings, indicating the specific resource types to search. |

**Response**

A successful response returns a list of matching resources for the query. For details on how the API determines matches for specific values, see the appendix section on [matching conventions](#conventions).

## Appendix

The following section contains additional information about using the `/search` endpoint.

### Value operator logic {#value-operator}

Search query values are split into terms to match against indexed documents. Between each term, an `AND` relationship is assumed.

When using `AND` as the `value_operator`, a query value of `My Rule Holiday Sale` is interpreted as documents with a field containing `My AND Rule AND Holiday AND Sale`.

When using `OR` as the `value_operator`, a query value of `My Rule Holiday Sale` is interpreted as documents with a field containing `My OR Rule OR Holiday OR Sale`. The more terms that match, the higher the `match_score`. Due to the nature of partial term matching, when nothing closely matches the desired value, you can obtain a result set where the value is matched only on a very basic level, such as a few characters of text.

### Matching conventions {#conventions}

Search is concerned with answering how relevant a document is to a supplied query. The way document data is analyzed and indexed directly affects this. 

The following table breaks down the match conventions for common field types:

| Field type | Match conventions |
| --- | --- |
| Strings | Text with a partial term analysis, case-insensitive |
| Enum values | Exact match, case-sensitive |
| Integers | Exact match |
| Floats | Exact match |
| Timestamps | Exact match (DateTime format) |
| Display names | Text with a partial term analysis, case-insensitive |

There are additional conventions for specific fields that appear in the API:

| Field | Match conventions |
| --- | --- |
| `id` | Exact match, case-sensitive |
| `delegate_descriptor_id` | Exact match, case-sensitive, with terms split on `::` |
| `name` | Exact match, case-sensitive |
| `settings` | Text with a partial term analysis, case-insensitive |
| `type` | Exact match, case-sensitive |
