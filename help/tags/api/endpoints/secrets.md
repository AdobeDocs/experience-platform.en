# Secrets endpoint

A secret is a resource that exists only within event forwarding properties (properties with an attribute of "platform": "edge"). They allow event forwarding to authenticate to another system for secure data exchange.

This guide shows you how to make calls to the `/secrets` endpoint in the Reactor API. For a detailed explanation of the different secret types and how to use them, please refer to the high-level overview on [secrets](../guides/secrets.md) before returning to this guide.
