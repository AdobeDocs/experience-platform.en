# Companies endpoint

A company represents a customer organization, typically a business. In the Reactor API, these companies match 1:1 with organization ID. API users only have visibility into the companies to which they have access. A company may contain many [properties](./properties.md). A property belongs to exactly one company.

The `/companies` endpoint in the Reactor API allows you to programmatically retrieve the companies that you have access to within your experience application.

## Getting started

The endpoint used in this guide is part of the [Reactor API](https://www.adobe.io/experience-platform-apis/references/reactor/). Before continuing, please review the [getting started guide](../getting-started.md) for important information regarding how to authenticate to the API.

## Retrieve a list of companies {#list}

You can list the companies that you are authorized to used by making a GET request to the `/companies` endpoint. In most cases, there is exactly one.

**API format**

```http
GET /companies
```

>[!NOTE]
>
>Using query parameters, listed companies can be filtered based on the following attributes:<ul><li>`created_at`</li><li>`name`</li><li>`org_id`</li><li>`token`</li><li>`updated_at`</li></ul>See the guide on [filtering responses](../guides/filtering.md) for more information.
