# Notes endpoint

In the Reactor API, notes are textual annotations that you can add to certain resources. Notes are essentially comments on their respective resources. The contents of notes have no impact on resource behavior, and can be used for a variety of of use cases including the following:

* Providing background information
* Functioning as to-do lists
* Passing along resource-usage advice
* Giving instructions to other team members
* Recording historical context

The `/notes` endpoint in the Reactor API allows you to manage these notes programmatically.

Notes can be applied the following resources:

* [Data elements](./data-elements.md)
* [Extensions](./extensions.md)
* [Libraries](./libraries.md)
* [Properties](./properties.md)
* [Rule components](./rule-components.md)
* [Rules](./rules.md)

These six types are collectively known as "notable" resources. When a notable resource is deleted, its associated notes are also deleted.

>[!NOTE]
>
>For resources that can have multiple revisions, any notes must be created on the current (head) revision. They may not be attached to other revisions.
>
>However, notes may still be read from revisions. In such cases, the API returns only the notes that existed before the creation of the revision. They provide a snapshot of the annotations as they were when the revision was cut. In contrast, reading notes from the current (head) revision returns all its notes.
