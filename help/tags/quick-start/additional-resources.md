>Adobe Experience Platform Launch is being rebranded as a suite of data collection technologies in Experience Platform. Several terminology changes have rolled out across the product documentation as a result. Please refer to the following [document](../term-updates.md) for a consolidated reference of the terminology changes.

The tags community of Adobe Experience Platform is full of talented professionals who share useful tips, tutorials, and tools across the web. This is a collection of some of the best things supplied by the community so far.

## General Usage

The [Awesome Adobe Launch](https://github.com/MisterPhilip/awesome-adobe-launch) GitHub repository provides a community-curated list of material related to tags.
