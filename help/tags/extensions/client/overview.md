# Tag extensions reference

>[!NOTE]
>
>Adobe Experience Platform Launch has been rebranded as a suite of data collection technologies in Adobe Experience Platform. Several terminology changes have rolled out across the product documentation as a result. Please refer to the following [document](../../term-updates.md) for a consolidated reference of the terminology changes.

The following is a list of documentation for client-side tag extensions. For a list of available server-side extensions, see the [event forwarding extensions reference](../server/overview.md) instead.

>[!NOTE]
>
>Any extension name followed by an asterisk (*) links to the extension's listing on Adobe Exchange, which contains installation and usage instructions. All other links point to the extension's documentation on Adobe Experience League.
