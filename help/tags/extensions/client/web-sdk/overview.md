# Adobe Experience Platform Web SDK extension overview

>[!NOTE]
>
>Adobe Experience Platform Launch has been rebranded as a suite of data collection technologies in Adobe Experience Platform. Several terminology changes have rolled out across the product documentation as a result. See [Term updates](/help/tags/term-updates.md) for a consolidated reference of terminology changes.

The Adobe Experience Platform Web SDK extension sends data to the Adobe Experience Cloud from web properties, through the Adobe Experience Platform Edge Network. The Experience Platform Web SDK extension allows for streaming data into platform, syncing identities, opt-in and automatically collecting context data. 

For details about configuring the Experience Platform Web SDK extension, see the [Configure the Web SDK tag extension](web-sdk-extension-configuration.md).

## Install the Web SDK tag extension {#install}

The Web SDK tag extension needs a property to be installed on. If you have not done so already, see the documentation on [creating a tag property](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/platform-learn/implement-in-websites/configure-tags/create-a-property.html).

1. Open the property and select the **[!UICONTROL Extensions]** tab on the left side bar.
1. Select the **[!UICONTROL Catalog]** tab.
1. From the list of available extensions, locate the **[!UICONTROL Adobe Experience Platform Web SDK]** extension, then select **[!UICONTROL Install]**.
