# Adobe Experience Platform Web SDK tag extension overview

The Adobe Experience Platform Web SDK tag extension sends data to the Adobe Experience Cloud from web properties, through the Adobe Experience Platform Edge Network. The Experience Platform Web SDK extension allows for streaming data into platform, syncing identities, opt-in and automatically collecting context data. 

See [Getting started](getting-started.md) to learn how to set up and deploy this tag extension to start collecting data.

Watch the video below to see Adobe Experience Platform [!DNL Web SDK] and [!DNL Edge Network] in action, using a single call to send data to [!DNL Experience Platform], [!DNL Analytics], [!DNL Audience Manager], and [!DNL Target].
