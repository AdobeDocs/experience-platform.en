# Adobe Experience Platform Web SDK extension overview

The Adobe Experience Platform Web SDK extension sends data to the Adobe Experience Cloud from web properties, through the Adobe Experience Platform Edge Network. The Experience Platform Web SDK extension allows for streaming data into platform, syncing identities, opt-in and automatically collecting context data. 

## Install the Web SDK tag extension {#install}

The Web SDK tag extension needs a property to be installed on. If you have not done so already, [create a tag property](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/platform-learn/implement-in-websites/configure-tags/create-a-property.html), which allows you to install the Web SDK tag extension.

1. Open the property and select the **[!UICONTROL Extensions]** tab on the left side bar.
1. Select the **[!UICONTROL Catalog]** tab.
1. From the list of available extensions, locate the **[!UICONTROL Adobe Experience Platform Web SDK]** extension, then select **[!UICONTROL Install]**.

1. After selecting **[!UICONTROL Install]**, you must configure the Web SDK tag extension and save the configuration.

Once the extension is [configured](configure/config-overview.md) and saved, you can add your changes to a working library then publish them.
