## Configure datastream settings {#datastreams}

This section allows you to select the datastreams that should be used for each of the three available environments (production, staging, and development).

When a request is sent to the Edge Network, a datastream ID is used to reference the server-side configuration. You can update the configuration without having to make code changes on your website.

See the guide on [datastreams](../../../../datastreams/overview.md) to learn how to configure a datastream.

You can either choose a datastream from the available drop-down menus, or select **[!UICONTROL Enter values]** and enter a custom datastream ID for each environment.
