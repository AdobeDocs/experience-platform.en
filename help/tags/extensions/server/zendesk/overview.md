# [!DNL Zendesk] Events API extension overview

[Zendesk](https://www.zendesk.com) is a customer service solution and sales tool. The Zendesk [event forwarding](../../../ui/event-forwarding/overview.md) extension leverages the [[!DNL Zendesk Events API]](https://developer.zendesk.com/documentation/ticketing/events/about-the-events-api/) to send events from the Adobe Experience Platform Edge Network to Zendesk for further processing. You can use the extension to collect customer profile interactions for use in downstream analysis and action.

This document covers how to install and configure the extension in the UI.

## Prerequisites

You must have a Zendesk account to use this extension. You can register for a Zendesk account on the [Zendesk website](https://www.zendesk.com/register/).

You must also gather the following details for your Zendesk configuration:

| Key type | Description | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Subdomain | During the registration process, a unique **subdomain** is created specific to the account. Refer to the [Zendesk documentation](https://developer.zendesk.com/documentation/ticketing/working-with-oauth/creating-and-using-oauth-tokens-with-the-api/) for more information. | `xxxxx.zendesk.com` (where `xxxxx` is the value that was provided during the account creation) |
| API token | Zendesk uses bearer tokens as an authentication mechanism to communicate with the Zendesk API. After logging in to the Zendesk portal, generate an API token. Refer to the [Zendesk documentation](https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4408889192858-Generating-a-new-API-token) for more information. | `cwWyOtHAv12w4dhpiulfe9BdZFTz3OKaTSzn2QvV` |

{style="table-layout:auto"}

Finally, you must create an event forwarding secret for the API token. Set the secret type to **[!UICONTROL Token]**, and set the value to the API token you gathered from your Zendesk configuration. Refer to the documentation on [secrets in event forwarding](../../../ui/event-forwarding/secrets.md) for more details on configuring secrets.

## Install the extension {#install}

To install the Zendesk extension in the UI, navigate to **Event Forwarding** and select a property to add the extension to, or create a new property instead.

Once you have selected or created the desired property, navigate to **Extensions** > **Catalog**. Search for "[!DNL Zendesk]", and then select **[!DNL Install]** on the Zendesk Extension.

## Configure the extension {#configure}

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>Depending on your implementation needs, you may need to create create a schema, data elements, and a dataset before configuring the extension. Please review all the configuration steps before starting in order to determine which entities you need to set up for your use case.

Select **Extensions** in the left navigation. Under **Installed**, select **Configure** on the Zendesk extension.

![Configure button for the Zendesk extension being selected in the UI](../../../images/extensions/server/zendesk/configure.png)

Under **[!UICONTROL Zendesk Domain]**, enter the value for your Zendesk subdomain. Under **[!UICONTROL Zendesk Token]**, select the secret you created earlier that contains the API token.

![Configuration options filled out in the UI](../../../images/extensions/server/zendesk/input.png)

## Configure an event forwarding rule

Start creating a new event forwarding rule [rule](../../../ui/managing-resources/rules.md) and configure its conditions as desired. When selecting the actions for the rule, select the [!UICONTROL Zendesk] extension, then select the [!UICONTROL Create Event] action type.

![Define Rule](../../../images/extensions/server/zendesk/rule.png)

When setting up the action configuration, you are prompted to assign data elements to the various properties that will be sent to Zendesk.

![Define Action Configuration](../../../images/extensions/server/zendesk/action-configurations.png)

These data elements should be mapped as referenced below.

### `event` keys

`event` is a JSON object that represents the event triggered by the user. Refer to the Zendesk document on the [anatomy of an event](https://developer.zendesk.com/documentation/ticketing/events/anatomy-of-an-event/) for details on the properties captured by the `event` object.

The following keys can be referenced within the `event` object when mapping to data elements:

| `event` key | Type | Platform path | Description | Mandatory | Limits |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `source` | String | `arc.event.xdm._extconndev.event_source`  |  The application which sent the event.  |  Yes  |  Do not use `Zendesk` as a value as it is a protected source name for Zendesk standard events. Attempts to use it will result in an error.<br>Value length must not exceed 40 characters. |
| `type` | String | `arc.event.xdm._extconndev.event_type` | A name for the event type. You can use this field to denote different kinds of events for a given source. For example, you can create one set of events for user logins and another for shopping carts. | Yes | Value length must not exceed 40 characters. |
| `description` | String | `arc.event.xdm._extconndev.description` | A description for the event. | No | (N/A) |
| `created_at` | String | `arc.event.xdm.timestamp` | An ISO-8601 timestamp reflecting the time the event was created. | No | (N/A) |
| `properties` | Object | `arc.event.xdm._extconndev.EventProperties` | A custom JSON object with details about the event. | Yes | (N/A) |

{style="table-layout:auto"}

>[!NOTE]
>
>Refer to the [[!DNL Zendesk Events API] documentation](https://developer.zendesk.com/documentation/ticketing/events/about-the-events-api/) for additional guidance on event properties.

### `profile` keys

`profile` is a JSON object that represents the user that triggered the event. Refer to the Zendesk document on the [anatomy of a profile](https://developer.zendesk.com/documentation/ticketing/profiles/anatomy-of-a-profile/) for details on the properties captured by the `profile` object.

The following keys can be referenced within the `profile` object when mapping to data elements:

| `profile` key | Type | Platform path | Description | Mandatory | Limits |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `source` | String | `arc.event.xdm._extconndev.profile_source` | The product or service associated with the profile, such as `Support`, `CompanyName`, or `Chat`. | Yes | (N/A) |
| `type` | String | `arc.event.xdm._extconndev.profile_type` | A name for the profile type. You can use this field to create different kinds of profiles for a given source. For example, you can create one set of company profiles for customers and another for employees. | Yes | Profile type length must not exceed 40 characters. |
| `name` | String | `arc.event.xdm._extconndev.name` | The name of the person from the profile | No | (N/A) |
| `user_id` | String | `arc.event.xdm._extconndev.user_id` | The person's user ID in Zendesk. | No | (N/A) |
| `identifiers` | Array | `arc.event.xdm._extconndev.identifiers` | An array containing at least one identifier. Each identifier consists of a type and a value. | Yes | Refer to the [Zendesk documentation](https://developer.zendesk.com/api-reference/ticketing/users/profiles_api/profiles_api/#identifiers-array) for more information on the `identifiers` array. All fields and values must be unique. |
| `attributes` | Object | `arc.event.xdm._extconndev.attrbutes` | An object containing user-defined properties about the person. | No | Refer to the [Zendesk documentation](https://developer.zendesk.com/documentation/ticketing/profiles/anatomy-of-a-profile/#attributes) for more information on profile attributes. |
