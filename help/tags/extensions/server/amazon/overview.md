# [!DNL Amazon] web events API extension overview

The [!DNL Amazon] Conversions API extension allows advertisers to send server-side conversion events from Adobe Experience Platform to [!DNL Amazon], improving campaign optimization and data attribution.

## [!DNL Amazon] prerequisites {#prerequisites}

<!-- To configure the [!DNL Amazon] web events API to use the [!DNL Amazon] events API, you need to generate a [!DNL Amazon] pixel code and access token. 

You must have a valid [!DNL Amazon] for business account in order to create a [!DNL Amazon] pixel using the partner setup. Go to the [[!DNL Amazon] for business registration page](https://www.Amazon.com/business/en-US/solutions/business-account) to register and create an account if you do not have one already.

You must be logged into your business account to set up [!DNL Amazon] Pixel using partner setup. To do this, follow the steps below:

1. Navigate to the **[!UICONTROL Assets]** tab and select **[!UICONTROL Event]**.
2. Under Web Events, select **[!UICONTROL Manage]**.
3. Select **[!UICONTROL Set Up Web Events]**.
4. Select **[!UICONTROL Partner Setup]** as your connection method. -->

<!-- See the [Get Started with Pixel](https://ads.Amazon.com/help/article/get-started-pixel) guide for more information on how to setup the [!DNL Amazon] pixel.

You can generate an access token once the pixel has been successfully created. To do this navigate to the Pixel and select the **[!UICONTROL Settings]** tab. Under Events API, select **[!UICONTROL Generate Access Token]**.

See the [[!DNL Amazon] getting started guide](https://business-api.Amazon.com/portal/docs?id=1739584855420929) for more information on how to setup the pixel code and access token. -->

## Install and configure the [!DNL Amazon] web events API extension {#install}

<!-- To install the extension, select **[!UICONTROL Extensions]** in the left navigation. In the **[!UICONTROL Catalog]** tab, select the **[!UICONTROL Amazon Web Events API Extension]** and then select **[!UICONTROL Install]**.

## Configure an event forwarding rule {#config-rule}

<!-- Once all your data elements are set up, you can start creating event forwarding rules that determine when and how your events will be sent to [!DNL Amazon].

Create a new [rule](../../../ui/managing-resources/rules.md) in your event forwarding property. Under **[!UICONTROL Actions]**, add a new action and set the extension to **[!UICONTROL Amazon Web Events API Extension]**. To send Edge Network events to [!DNL Amazon], set the **[!UICONTROL Action Type]** to **[!UICONTROL Send Amazon Web Events API Event].**

After selection, additional controls appear to further configure the event, as outlined below. Once complete, select **[!UICONTROL Keep Changes]** to save the rule.

## Event deduplication {#deduplication}

[!DNL Amazon] pixel will need to be setup for deduplication if you use both the [!DNL Amazon] pixel SDK and the [!DNL Amazon] web events API extension to send the same events to [!DNL Amazon]. 

Deduplication is not required if distinct event types are being sent from the client and server without any overlap. To ensure that your reporting is not negatively impacted, you must make sure that any single event that is shared by the [!DNL Amazon] pixel SDK and the [!DNL Amazon] web events API extension is deduplicated.

When sending shared events, make sure that every event includes a pixel ID, event ID and name. Duplicated events that arrive within five minutes of each other will be merged. If the data field was absent from the first event, it will be combined with the subsequent event. Any duplicate events received within 48 hours will be removed.

See the [!DNL Amazon] documentation on [Event Deduplication](https://ads.Amazon.com/help/article/event-deduplication) for more details on this process.
