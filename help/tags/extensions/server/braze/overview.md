# [!DNL Braze Track Events API] event forwarding extension

[[!DNL Braze]](https://www.braze.com) is a customer engagement platform that powers customer-centric interactions between consumers and brands in real time. Using [!DNL Braze], you can do the following:

- Deliver data (such as marketing messages) to targeted users based on their language preference, location preference, and more, to increase conversion rates and support key business goals.
- Send customers personalized messages across multiple channels, including email, push notifications, and in-app messages, at just the right time and in their preferred languages.
- Target specific users for marketing and promotional campaigns to increase the number of repeat customers.
- Study user behavior and patterns to target specific audiences with customized messages, which could help increase revenue.

The [!DNL Braze Track Events API] [event forwarding](../../../ui/event-forwarding/overview.md) extension allows you to leverage data captured in the Adobe Experience Platform Edge Network and send it to [!DNL Braze] in the form of server-side events using the [[!DNL Braze User Track]](https://www.braze.com/docs/api/endpoints/user_data/post_user_track) API.

This document covers the use cases of the extension, how to install it in your event forwarding libraries, and how to employ its capabilities in an event forwarding [rule](../../../ui/managing-resources/rules.md).

## Use cases

This extension should be used if you want to use data from the Edge Network in [!DNL Braze] to take advantage of its customer analytics and targeting capabilities.

For example, consider a retail organization that has a multichannel presence (website and mobile) and is capturing transactional or conversational input as event data from their website and mobile platforms. Using various [tag](../../../home.md) rules, this data is sent to the Edge Network in real time. From here, the [!DNL Braze] event forwarding extension automatically sends relevant events to [!DNL Braze] from the server side.

Once the data has been sent, the organization's analytics teams can then leverage [!DNL Braze's] capabilities to process the datasets and derive business insights to generate graphs, dashboards, or other visualizations to inform business stakeholders. Refer to the [[!DNL Braze] customers](https://www.braze.com/customers) page for more details of the various use cases of the platform.

## [!DNL Braze] prerequisites and guardrails {#prerequisites}

You must have a [!DNL Braze] account in order to use its technologies. If you do not have an account, navigate to the [Get Started page](https://www.braze.com/get-started/) on [!DNL Braze] to connect to [!DNL Braze Sales] and start the account creation process.

### API guardrails

The extension uses two of [!DNL Braze]'s APIs and their limits are outlined below:

| API | Rate Limits |
| --- | --- |
| [!DNL User Track] | 50,000 requests per minute. <br>Refer to the [[!DNL User Track] API documentation](https://www.braze.com/docs/api/endpoints/user_data/post_user_track#rate-limit) for details. |
| [!DNL User Identify] | 20,000 requests per minute. <br>Refer to the [[!DNL User Identify] API documentation](https://www.braze.com/docs/api/endpoints/user_data/post_user_identify#rate-limit) for details. |

>[!NOTE]
>
> Refer to the guide on [[!DNL Braze] API limits](https://www.braze.com/docs/api/api_limits/) for further details on the limits they impose.

### Billable data points

Sending additional custom attributes to [!DNL Braze] may increase your [!DNL Braze] data point consumption. Consult with your [!DNL Braze] account manager before sending additional custom attributes. Refer to the [!DNL Braze] documentation on [billable data points](https://www.braze.com/docs/user_guide/onboarding_with_braze/data_points/#billable-data-points) for more information.

### Gather required configuration details {#configuration-details}

In order to connect the Edge Network to [!DNL Braze], the following inputs are required:

| Key Type | Description | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [!DNL Braze] Instance | The REST endpoint associated with the [!DNL Braze] account. Refer to the [!DNL Braze] documentation on [instances](https://www.braze.com/docs/user_guide/administrative/access_braze/sdk_endpoints) for guidance. | `https://rest.iad-03.braze.com` |

### Create a secret

Create a new [event forwarding secret](../../../ui/event-forwarding/secrets.md) and set the value to your [[!DNL Braze] API Key](#configuration-details). This will be used to authenticate the connection to your account while keeping the value secure.

## Install and configure the [!DNL Braze] extension {#install}

## Validate data within [!DNL Braze] {#validate}

If the event collection and [!DNL Adobe Experience Platform] integration were successful, you will see events within the [!DNL Braze] console when [viewing user profiles](https://www.braze.com/docs/user_guide/engagement_tools/segments/user_profiles/). Specifically, the new event data sent to [!DNL Braze] is reflected in the [!DNL Purchases] section of a particular user's [overview tab](https://www.braze.com/docs/user_guide/engagement_tools/segments/user_profiles/#overview-tab).

## Next steps

This guide covered how to send conversion events to [!DNL Braze] using event forwarding. For more details on downstream applications for event data sent to [!DNL Braze], refer to the [official documentation](https://www.braze.com/docs).
