# [!DNL The Trade Desk Real-Time Conversions API] extension overview

The [[!DNL Trade Desk Real-Time Conversions API]](https://partner.thetradedesk.com/v3/portal/data/doc/DataConversionEventsApi) allows you to send events to [!DNL The Trade Desk] in order to leverage retargeting and attribution.

You can use the [!DNL Trade Desk Real-Time Conversions API] extension to send data from the Adobe Experience Platform Edge Network to [!DNL The Trade Desk] by utilizing the API's capabilities in your [event forwarding](../../../ui/event-forwarding/overview.md) rules. 

Using the [!DNL Trade Desk Real-Time Conversions API] extension, you can leverage the API's capabilities in your [event forwarding](../../../ui/event-forwarding/overview.md) rules to send data to [!DNL The Trade Desk] from the Adobe Experience Platform Edge Network. 

This document covers how to install the extension and use its capabilities in an event forwarding [rule](../../../ui/managing-resources/rules.md).

## Prerequisites {#prerequisites}

You must have a relevantÂ Advertiser ID, UPixel ID, and Tracker ID are required from within your [!DNL The Trade Desk] account in order to configure the [!DNL The Trade Desk] Real-Time Conversions API.

>[!INFO]
>
>If you are a merchant, you will also need to obtain your Merchant ID.

## Install and configure the [!DNL The Trade Desk] Real-Time Conversions API {#install}

To install the extension, [create an event forwarding property](../../../ui/event-forwarding/overview.md#properties) or select an existing property to edit instead.

Select **[!UICONTROL Extensions]** in the left navigation. In the **[!UICONTROL Catalog]** tab, select the **[!UICONTROL The Trade Desk]** Real-Time Conversions API card, then select **[!UICONTROL Install]**.

On the next screen, enter the [!UICONTROL Advertiser ID], and optionally a [!UICONTROL Merchant ID]. You can paste the ID's directly into these inputs, or you can use a data element instead. These will serve as the default values used when making an event call to [!DNL The Trade Desk] Real-Time Conversions API. Select **[!UICONTROL Save]** when finished.

![The [!DNL The Trade Desk] extension configuration page with the [!UICONTROL Advertiser ID] and [!UICONTROL Merchant ID] fields highlighted.](../../../images/extensions/server/tradedesk/configure-extension.png)

The extension is installed and you can now employ its capabilities in your event forwarding rules.

## Configure an event forwarding rule {#rule}

Once you have installed and configured the extension, you can start creating event forwarding rules that determine how and when you events will be sent to [!DNL The Trade Desk].

You should consider configuring several rules in order to send all accepted [request properties](https://partner.thetradedesk.com/v3/portal/data/doc/DataConversionEventsApi#properties) via [!DNK The Trade Desk] and [!DNL The Trade Desk] Real-Time Conversions API.

>[!NOTE]
>
>Events should be sent out in real-time or as close to real-time as possible.

Create a new event forwarding [rule](../../../ui/managing-resources/rules.md) in your event forwarding property. Under **[!UICONTROL Actions]**, add a new action and set the extension to **[!UICONTROL The Trade Desk]**. Next, select **[!UICONTROL Real Time Conversion]** for the **[!UICONTROL Action Type]**.

![The Event Forwarding Property Rules view, with the fields required to add an event forwarding rule action configuration highlighted.](../../../images/extensions/server/tradedesk/tradedesk-event-action.png)

After selection, additional controls appear to further configure the event data that will be sent to [!DNL The Trade Desk]. Select **[!UICONTROL Keep Changes]** to save the rule.

The configuration options are divided into three main sections as outlined below:

**[!UICONTROL Basic Request Properties]**

| Input | Description | 
| --- | --- |
| Tracker ID | The platform ID of the event tracker. |
| UPixel ID | The universal pixel ID for the event. |

## Next steps

This guide covered how to send server-side event data to [!DNL The Trade Desk] using the [!DNL The Trade Desk] Real-Time Conversions API extension. From here, it is recommended to expand your integration by creating distinct rules that send specific conversion events as applicable. For more information on event forwarding capabilities in [!DNL Adobe Experience Platform], read the [event forwarding overview](../../../ui/event-forwarding/overview.md).
