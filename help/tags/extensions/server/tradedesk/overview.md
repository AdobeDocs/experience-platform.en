# [!DNL The Trade Desk Real-Time Conversions API] extension overview

You can use the [[!DNL The Trade Desk Real-Time Conversions API]](https://partner.thetradedesk.com/v3/portal/data/doc/DataConversionEventsApi) extension to send data from the Adobe Experience Platform Edge Network to [!DNL The Trade Desk] by utilizing the API's capabilities in your [event forwarding](../../../ui/event-forwarding/overview.md) rules. 

Using [!DNL The Trade Desk Real-Time Conversions API] extension, you can leverage the API's capabilities in your [event forwarding](../../../ui/event-forwarding/overview.md) rules to send data to [!DNL The Trade Desk] from the Adobe Experience Platform Edge Network. 

Read this document to learn how to install the extension and use its capabilities in an event forwarding [rule](../../../ui/managing-resources/rules.md).

>[!NOTE]
>
>This extension and documentation page are maintained by [!DNL The Trade Desk] team. For any inquiries or update requests, please contact them directly.

## Prerequisites {#prerequisites}

You must have a relevantÂ Advertiser ID, UPixel ID, and Tracker ID are required from within your [!DNL The Trade Desk] account in order to configure the [[!DNL The Trade Desk Real-Time Conversions API]](https://partner.thetradedesk.com/v3/portal/data/doc/DataConversionEventsApi).

>[!INFO]
>
>If you are a merchant, you will also need to obtain your Merchant ID.

## Install and configure the [!DNL The Trade Desk] Real-Time Conversions API {#install}

To install the extension, [create an event forwarding property](../../../ui/event-forwarding/overview.md#properties) or select an existing property to edit instead.

Select **[!UICONTROL Extensions]** in the left navigation. In the **[!UICONTROL Catalog]** tab, select the **[!UICONTROL The Trade Desk]** Real-Time Conversions API card, then select **[!UICONTROL Install]**.

On the next screen, enter the [!UICONTROL Advertiser ID], and optionally a [!UICONTROL Merchant ID]. You can paste the ID's directly into these inputs, or you can use a data element instead. These will serve as the default values used when making an event call to [!DNL The Trade Desk] Real-Time Conversions API. Select **[!UICONTROL Save]** when finished.

To learn how you can create data elements and make them available to extensions in your tag property, follow the [Create data elements](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/platform-learn/data-collection/tags/create-data-elements) tutorial.

![The [!DNL The Trade Desk] extension configuration page with the [!UICONTROL Advertiser ID] and [!UICONTROL Merchant ID] fields highlighted.](../../../images/extensions/server/tradedesk/configure-extension.png)

The extension is installed and you can now employ its capabilities in your event forwarding rules.

## Configure an event forwarding rule {#rule}

Once you have installed and configured the extension, you can start creating event forwarding rules that determine how and when you events will be sent to [!DNL The Trade Desk].

You should consider configuring several rules in order to send all accepted [request properties](https://partner.thetradedesk.com/v3/portal/data/doc/DataConversionEventsApi#properties) via [!DNL The Trade Desk] and [!DNL The Trade Desk] Real-Time Conversions API.

>[!NOTE]
>
>Events should be sent out in real-time or as close to real-time as possible.

Create a new event forwarding [rule](../../../ui/managing-resources/rules.md) in your event forwarding property. Under **[!UICONTROL Actions]**, add a new action and set the extension to **[!UICONTROL The Trade Desk]**. Next, select **[!UICONTROL Real Time Conversion]** for the **[!UICONTROL Action Type]**.

![The Event Forwarding Property Rules view, with the fields required to add an event forwarding rule action configuration highlighted.](../../../images/extensions/server/tradedesk/tradedesk-event-action.png)

After selection, additional controls appear to further configure the event data that will be sent to [!DNL The Trade Desk]. Select **[!UICONTROL Keep Changes]** to save the rule.

The configuration options are divided into three main sections as outlined below:

**[!UICONTROL Basic Request Properties]**

| Input | Description | 
| --- | --- |
| Tracker ID | The platform ID of the event tracker. |
| UPixel ID | The universal pixel ID for the event. |
| Referrer URL | The website URL from where the event occurred, if any. |
| Event Name | The type of event defined by the partner platform. |
| Value | The revenue-tracking value in decimal string (for example, "19.98"). |
| Currency | Currency code in ISO format. |
| Client IP |  The client IPv4 or IPv6 IP address. |
| Ad ID | The unique advertising ID for the event. |
| Ad ID Type | The type of the advertising ID, specified in the AD ID property: TDID, IDFA, AAID, DAID, NAID, IDL, EUID, or UID2. |
| Impression | A 36-character string (including dashes) that serves as the unique ID for the impression to which the event is attributed. |
| Order ID | The associated order identifier of the event. |
| td1-td10 | Ten sequentially numbered custom dynamic properties that can be used to provide additional conversion metadata. |

Refer to the [!DNL The Trade Desk] developer documentation for more information on the [request properties](https://partner.thetradedesk.com/v3/portal/data/doc/DataConversionEventsApi#properties) accepted by [!DNL The Trade Desk] Real-Time Conversions API. 

**[!UICONTROL Object Request Parameters]**

A JSON object containing more information. You have the option to use a reduced set of key-value inputs or to supply raw JSON. Additionally, you can retrieve dynamic data from a data element by selecting the disks (![Disk Icon](../../../images/extensions/server/tradedesk/disk-icon.png)) on the right.

## Next steps

This guide covered how to send server-side event data to [!DNL The Trade Desk] using the [!DNL The Trade Desk] Real-Time Conversions API extension. From here, it is recommended to expand your integration by creating distinct rules that send specific conversion events as applicable per campaign. For more information on event forwarding capabilities in [!DNL Adobe Experience Platform], read the [event forwarding overview](../../../ui/event-forwarding/overview.md).
