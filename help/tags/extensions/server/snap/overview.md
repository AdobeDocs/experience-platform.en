# [!DNL Snapchat] conversions API extension overview

The [!DNL Snap] Conversion API Extension is a secure [Edge Network Server API](/help/server-api/overview.md) interface that allows you to share information with [!DNL Snapchat] directly about user actions on your websites. You can leverage the event forwarding rules to send data from the [!DNL Adobe Experience Platform Edge Network] to [!DNL Snapchat] by using the [!DNL Snap] Conversion API extension.

## [!DNL Snapchat] prerequisites {#prerequisites}

To use the [!DNL Snapchat] Conversions API, you must have an [Event Forwarding property](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/experience-platform/tags/event-forwarding/getting-started) set up in the Adobe Experience Platform and the [required permissions](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/experience-platform/collection/permissions) to edit the property. 

Create a [Datastream](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/experience-platform/tags/event-forwarding/getting-started#create-a-datastream?) and add the [Event Forwarding service](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/experience-platform/tags/event-forwarding/getting-started#enable-event-forwarding) to it. 

A **[!DNL Snapchat]** [Business Manager](https://business.snapchat.com/) account is required to use the Conversions API. Business Manager helps advertisers integrate **[!DNL Snapchat]**'s marketing efforts across their business and with external partners. See the **[!DNL Snapchat]** [help center article](https://businesshelp.snapchat.com/s/article/get-started?language=en_US) on creating a Business Manager account if you don't have one.

A [**[!DNL Snap Pixel]**](https://businesshelp.snapchat.com/s/article/pixel-website-install?language=en_US) must be set up in the Snapchat Ads Manager, and you must have access to view the Pixel ID. The Pixel ID can be found in the **[!UICONTROL Events Manager]**(https://businesshelp.snapchat.com/s/article/events-manager?language=en_US) section.


You need a static, long-lived API token. See the [[!DNL Snapchat] Conversions API documentation](https://developers.snap.com/api/marketing-api/Conversions-API/GetStarted#access-token) to obtain this token.

## Install and configure the [!DNL Snapchat] web events API extension {#install}

To install the extension, navigate to **[!UICONTROL Data Collection]**>[!UICONTROL Event Forwarding]. Select the property where you want to install the extension.

Once the desired property is selected, follow these steps:

1. In the left navigation panel, select **[!UICONTROL Extensions]**.
2. Search for the **[!UICONTROL Snap Conversion API Extension]** and select **[!UICONTROL Install]**.

    ![Image showing install button]().

3. On the configuration screen, input the following values:

 * **[!UICONTROL Pixel Id]**  
 * **[!UICONTROL API Token]**

When finished, select **[!UICONTROL Save]**.

![Image showing pixel id and api token button](../../../images/extensions/server/snap/install.png).

## Create data elements {#create-data-elements}

To pass data points as parameters to the [!DNL Snapchat] Conversions API extension, you must create [data elements](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/platform-learn/implement-web-sdk/event-forwarding/setup-event-forwarding#create-an-event-forwarding-data-element) for each data point. Follow these steps:

1. Navigate to **[!UICONTROL Authoring]**>[!UICONTROL Data Elements] in your property's **[!UICONTROL Property Info]** screen, and then select **[!UICONTROL Add Data Element]**.

    ![Image showing add data element button](../../../images/extensions/server/snap/add_data_element.png).

2. Enter a name for the data element.

3. Select **[!UICONTROL Core]** as the extension and [!UICONTROL Path] as the data element type. 

4. From the drop-down menu, select the appropriate item, and fill in the [!UICONTROL Path] field in the right-side panel to reference the desired data in your schema. 

    ![Image showing create data element screen](../../../images/extensions/server/snap/create_data_element.png).

For example, if you are creating a data element that references `snapClickId` in the schema shown below:

![Image showing schema ](../../../images/extensions/server/snap/schema.png).

You must configure the data element because `snapClickId` is located under `_snap.inc.exchange` in the XDM schema.

![Image showing edit data element screen](../../../images/extensions/server/snap/edit_data_element.png).

See the [Event Forwarding properties documentation](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/experience-platform/tags/event-forwarding/overview#data-elements) for more details on creating data elements.

## Create rules to send conversions events to snap {#create-snap-rules}

[Rules](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/platform-learn/implement-web-sdk/event-forwarding/setup-event-forwarding#create-an-event-forwarding-rule) are used to trigger extensions in Platform. This section outlines how to create rules within your event forwarding property to send conversion events to Snap using the CAPI extension.

### Create a new rule

1. Navigate to your event forwarding property and select [!UICONTROL Rules] from the Authoring menu. Then, click [!UICONTROL Create New Rule].

    ![Image showing rules in left navigation](../../../images/extensions/server/snap/create_new_rule.png).

2. Name the rule and configure a condition for triggering the Snap event. For example, to send a `PURCHASE` event whenever an event includes an order number, set a condition to check if the user interaction contains a valid purchase order number. 

    ![Image showing condition configuration screen](../../../images/extensions/server/snap/action_configuration.png).

3. After saving the condition, add an action to trigger the Snap Conversion API. In the left-side panel:

    * Set the [!UICONTROL Extension] dropdown menu to [!UICONTROL Snap Conversions API Extension].

    * Set the [!UICONTROL Action Type] dropdown menu to [!UICONTROL Report Web Conversions].

    * Name the rule accordingly.

    ![Image showing action configuration screen](../../../images/extensions/server/snap/action_configuration.png).

4. Configure the [CAPI parameter values](https://developers.snap.com/api/marketing-api/Conversions-API/Parameters) you want to send for the event in the **[!UICONTROL Data Bindings]** section on the right-side panel. The fields in the extension map to CAPI parameters as shown below. See the [Snapchat Conversions API documentation](https://developers.snap.com/api/marketing-api/Conversions-API/Parameters) for more information about each parameter.

    * All events will have `event_source` set to WEB. 

    * At least one of the following fields or combinations is required for matching: 

        * Email
        * Phone Number
        * IP Address and User Agent

Additional notes:

* For `PURCHASE` events, the `Currency` and `Price` fields are required.

* Enabling the [!UICONTROL Test Mode] checkbox sends events as Test Events, which appear in the Test Event Tool instead of standard reporting. See this [business help center article](https://businesshelp.snapchat.com/s/article/capi-event-testing?language=en_US#:~:text=Snap's%20Conversions%20API%20(CAPI)%20Test,being%20processed%20as%20production%20results.) for more details. 

* The `contents` parameter should be a JSON string containing at least one of the following fields: 

    * `id`
    * `item_category`
    * `brand`
    * `delivery_category`
    * `item_price`
    * `quantity`

Example:

```json
{
  "id": "id1",
  "brand": "brand1",
  "delivery_category": "c1",
  "item_price": 2.00,
  "quantity": 2
}
```

To use [custom conversions value and ROAS reporting](https://businesshelp.snapchat.com/s/article/custom-conversions-value-roas?language=en_US), include relevant parameters in the `contents` field e.g., brand, item_price, id.

Example Configuration for a `PURCHASE` event:

The optional fields could be set like this:

[Image showing optional fields](../../../images/extensions/server/snap/optional_fields.png)

Once you set the rule's name, condition and action as described above, save the rule and make sure it's enabled.

You can now publish these changes to your property. Please see Platform documentation on the [publishing flow](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/experience-platform/tags/publish/overview) for more information.

## Troubleshoot {#troubleshoot}

For troubleshooting and optimizing your setup, review the [Event Quality Score recommendations](https://businesshelp.snapchat.com/s/article/event-quality-score) to ensure your events achieve the highest possible match rates and performance outcomes.
