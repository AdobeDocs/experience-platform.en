# [!DNL TikTok] web events API extension overview

The [!DNL TikTok] events API is a secure [Edge Network Server API](/help/server-api/overview.md) interface that allows you to share information with [!DNL TikTok] directly about user actions on your websites. You can leverage the event forwarding rules to send data from the [!DNL Adobe Experience Platform Edge Network] to [!DNL TikTok] by using the [!DNL TikTok] Web Events API extension.

## [!DNL TikTok] prerequisites {#prerequisites}

To configure the [!DNL TikTok] web events API to use the [!DNL TikTok] events API, you need to generate a [!DNL TikTok] pixel code and access token. 

You must have a valid [!DNL TikTok] for business account in order to create a [!DNL TikTok] pixel using the partner setup. Go to the [[!DNL TikTok] for business registration page](https://www.tiktok.com/business/en-US/solutions/business-account) to register and create an account if you do not have one already.

You must be logged into your business account to set up [!DNL TikTok] Pixel using partner setup. To do this, follow the steps below:

1. Navigate to the **[!UICONTROL Assets]** tab and select **[!UICONTROL Event]**.
2. Under Web Events, select **[!UICONTROL Manage]**.
3. Select **[!UICONTROL Set Up Web Events]**.
4. Select **[!UICONTROL Partner Setup]** as your connection method.

See the [Get Started with Pixel](https://ads.tiktok.com/help/article/get-started-pixel) guide for more information on how to setup the [!DNL TikTok] pixel.

You can generate an access token once the pixel has been successfully created. To do this navigate to the Pixel and select the **[!UICONTROL Settings]** tab. Under Events API, select **[!UICONTROL Generate Access Token]**.

See the [[!DNL TikTok] getting started guide](https://business-api.tiktok.com/portal/docs?id=1739584855420929) for more information on how to setup the pixel code and access token.

## Install and configure the [!DNL TikTok] web events API extension {#install}

To install the extension, select **[!UICONTROL Extensions]** in the left navigation. In the **[!UICONTROL Catalog]** tab, select the **[!UICONTROL TikTok Web Events API Extension]** and then select **[!UICONTROL Install]**.

* **[!UICONTROL Pixel Code]**
* **[!UICONTROL Access Token]**

When finished, select **[!UICONTROL Save]**.

## Configure an event forwarding rule {#config-rule}

Once all your data elements are set up, you can start creating event forwarding rules that determine when and how your events will be sent to [!DNL TikTok].

Create a new [rule](../../../ui/managing-resources/rules.md) in your event forwarding property. Under **[!UICONTROL Actions]**, add a new action and set the extension to **[!UICONTROL TikTok Web Events API Extension]**. To send Edge Network events to [!DNL TikTok], set the **[!UICONTROL Action Type]** to **[!UICONTROL Send TikTok Web Events API Event].**

![The [!UICONTROL Send TikTok Web Events API Event] action type being selected for a [!DNL TikTok] rule in the Data Collection UI.](../../../images/extensions/server/tiktok/select-action.png)

After selection, additional controls appear to further configure the event, as outlined below. Once complete, select **[!UICONTROL Keep Changes]** to save the rule.

**[!UICONTROL Web Events and Parameters]**

## Event deduplication {#deduplication}

[!DNL TikTok] pixel will need to be setup for deduplication if you use both the [!DNL TikTok] pixel SDK and the [!DNL TikTok] web events API extension to send the same events to [!DNL TikTok]. 

Deduplication is not required if distinct event types are being sent from the client and server without any overlap. To ensure that your reporting is not negatively impacted, you must make sure that any single event that is shared by the [!DNL TikTok] pixel SDK and the [!DNL TikTok] web events API extension is deduplicated.

When sending shared events, make sure that every event includes a pixel ID, event ID and name. Duplicated events that arrive within five minutes of each other will be merged. If the data field was absent from the first event, it will be combined with the subsequent event. Any duplicate events received within 48 hours will be removed.

See the [!DNL TikTok] documentation on [Event Deduplication](https://ads.tiktok.com/help/article/event-deduplication) for more details on this process.
