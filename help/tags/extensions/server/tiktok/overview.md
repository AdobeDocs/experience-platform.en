# [!DNL TikTok] web events API extension overview

The [!DNL TikTok] events API is a secure [Edge Network Server API](../server-api/overview.md) interface that allows you to share information with [!DNL TikTok] directly about user actions on your websites. You can leverage the event forwarding rules to send data from the [!DNL Adobe Experience Platform Edge Network] to [!DNL TikTok] by using the [!DNL TikTok] Web Events API extension.

## [!DNL TikTok] prerequisites {#prerequisites}

To configure the [!DNL TikTok] web events API to use the [!DNL TikTok] events API, you need to generate a [!DNL TikTok] pixel code and access token. 

You must have a valid [!DNL TikTok] for business account in order to create a [!DNL TikTok] pixel using the partner setup. Go to the [[!DNL TikTok] for business registration page](https://www.tiktok.com/business/en-US/solutions/business-account) to register and create an account if you do not have one already.

You must be logged into your business account to set up [!DNL TikTok] Pixel using partner setup. To do this follow the steps below:

1. Navigate to the **[!UICONTROL Assets]** tab and select **[!UICONTROL Event]**.
2. Under Web Events, select **[!UICONTROL Manage]**.
3. Select **[!UICONTROL Set Up Web Events]**.
4. Select **[!UICONTROL Partner Setup]** as your connection method.

Refer to the [Get Started with Pixel](https://ads.tiktok.com/help/article/get-started-pixel) for more information on how to setup the [!DNL TikTok] pixel.

You can generate an access token once the pixel has been successfully created. To do this navigate to the Pixel and select the **[!UICONTROL Settings]** tab. Under Events API, select **[!UICONTROL Generate Access Token]**.

Refer to the [[!DNL TikTok] getting started guide](https://business-api.tiktok.com/portal/docs?id=1739584855420929) for more information on how to setup the pixel code and access token.

## Install and configure the [!DNL TikTok] web events API extension {#install}

To install the extension, select **[!UICONTROL Extensions]** in the left navigation. In the **[!UICONTROL Catalog]** tab, select the **[!UICONTROL TikTok Web Events API Extension]** and then select **[!UICONTROL Install]**.

* **[!UICONTROL Pixel Code]**
* **[!UICONTROL Access Token]**

When finished, select **[!UICONTROL Save]**.

## Configure an event forwarding rule {#config-rule}

Once all your data elements are set up, you can start creating event forwarding rules that determine when and how your events will be sent to [!DNL TikTok].

Create a new [rule](../../../ui/managing-resources/rules.md) in your event forwarding property. Under **[!UICONTROL Actions]**, add a new action and set the extension to **[!UICONTROL TikTok Web Events API Extension]**. To send Edge Network events to [!DNL TikTok], set the **[!UICONTROL Action Type]** to **[!UICONTROL Send TikTok Web Events API Event].**

After selection, additional controls appear to further configure the event. Select **[!UICONTROL Keep Changes]** to save the rule.

**[!UICONTROL Web Events and Parameters]**

## Event deduplication {#deduplication}

[!DNL TikTok] pixel will need to be setup for deduplication if you use both the [!DNL TikTok] pixel SDK and the [!DNL TikTok] web events API extension to send the same events to [!DNL TikTok]. 

If you are sending different event types from the client and server with no overlap between the two, then deduplication is not necessary. However, if any single event is shared by both [!DNL TikTok] pixel SDK and the [!DNL TikTok] web events API extension, you must ensure that these redundant events are deduplicated so that your reporting is not adversely affected.

When sending shared events, make sure that you are including a pixel ID, event ID and name with every event that you send from both the client and server. Duplicated events that arrive within five minutes of each other will be merged. The latter event will be merged into the first event, if the data field was not present in the first event. After five minutes any duplicated events received within 48 hours, the latter will be dropped.

See the [!DNL TikTok] documentation on [Event Deduplication](https://ads.tiktok.com/help/article/event-deduplication) for details on this process.
