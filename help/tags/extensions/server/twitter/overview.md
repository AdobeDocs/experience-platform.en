# [!DNL Twitter] event forwarding extension

[[!DNL Twitter]](https://twitter.com/i/flow/login) is an online social media and social networking service, on which users post and interact with 280-character-long messages known as tweets. Users can interact with Twitter using a browser, mobile frontend software, or programmatically through its [APIs](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api)

The [!DNL Twitter] Web Conversions API [event forwarding](../../../ui/event-forwarding/overview.md) extension allows you to leverage data captured in the Adobe Experience Platform Edge Network and send it to [!DNL Twitter]. This document covers the use cases of the extension, how to install it, and how to integrate its capabilities into your event forwarding [rules](../../../ui/managing-resources/rules.md).

[!DNL Twitter] requires [OAuth 1.0](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/authentication/oauth-1-0a) for authentication with the [!DNL Twitter] [!DNL Web Conversions] API.

## Use cases

This extension should be used if you want to use data from the Edge Network in [!DNL Twitter] to take advantage of its customer analytics and targeting capabilities.

For example, consider a marketing team in an organization. The team captures user interaction event data from their website as event data from their website and loads it into [!DNL Twitter] using this event forwarding extension.

The marketing and analytics teams can then leverage [!DNL Twitter's] capabilities to perform additional analysis and target these users for targeted advertisement campaigns.

## Configure an event forwarding rule {#config-rule}

Once all your data elements are set up, you can start creating event forwarding rules that determine when and how your events will be sent to [!DNL Twitter].

Create a new [rule](../../../ui/managing-resources/rules.md) in your event forwarding property. Under **[!UICONTROL Actions]**, add a new action and set the extension to **[!UICONTROL Twitter]**. To send Edge Network events to [!DNL Twitter], set the **[!UICONTROL Action Type]** to **[!UICONTROL Send Web Conversion].**

After selection, additional controls appear to further configure the event. You need to map the [!DNL Twitter] event properties to the data elements that you previously created.
