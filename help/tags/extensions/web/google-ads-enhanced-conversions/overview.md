# Google Ads Enhanced Conversions extension

Using the Google Ads API, you can leverage [enhanced conversions](https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/9888656) by sending first-party customer data in the form of conversion adjustments. Google uses this additional data to improve the reporting of your online conversions driven by ad interactions. 

The [Google Ads Enhanced Conversions event forwarding extension](https://exchange.adobe.com/apps/ec/108630/google-ads-enhanced-conversions) (heretofore referred to as the Enhanced Conversions extension) provides a user-friendly template to easily implement enhanced conversions for the Google Ads API. 

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>Enhanced conversions will only work for conversion types where customer data is present like subscriptions, sign-ups and purchases. One or more of the following pieces of customer data must be available: 
>
>* Email address (preferred) 
>* Name and home address (street address, city, state/region, and postal code) 
>* Phone number (must be provided in addition to one of the other two pieces of information above) 

## Implementation overview 

Using the Google Ads API, enhanced conversions adds first-party data to a conversion that happened on a client device, usually a website. This means that there are two steps to implement enhanced conversions: 

1. Send a conversion from the client.
1. Send additional first-party data from event forwarding to enhance the conversion data sent from the client.

>[!TIP]
>
>To associate the client-side conversion event with the first-party data sent from event forwarding, the `transaction_ID` must be the same in both calls. For more information on where this value must be provided for each service, see the sections on configuring conversion actions for [tags](#conversion-action-tags) and [event forwarding](#conversion-action-event-forwarding), respectively.

Since sending conversion events involves both a client-side and server-side implementation, this document covers the prerequisite steps for setting up the client-side [Google Global Site Tag (gtag) extension](https://exchange.adobe.com/apps/ec/101437/google-global-site-tag-gtag) in addition to the Enhanced Conversions extension for event forwarding.

## Send a conversion using tags

To send a conversion event from on a website, Google Global Site Tag (gtag) must be deployed. You can achieve this using tags by configuring and installing the Google Global Site Tag (gtag) extension.

### Configure and install the Google Global Site Tag extension

Navigate to the Data Collection UI or Experience Platform and select **[!UICONTROL Tags]** in the left navigation. Select the tag property you wish to install the extension on, then select **[!UICONTROL Extensions]** in the left navigation. Under the **[!UICONTROL Catalog]** tab, locate the [!UICONTROL Google Global Site Tag (gtag)] extension and select **[!UICONTROL Install]**.

The installation dialog appears. From here, select **[!UICONTROL Add Account]** and provide the following values when prompted:

| Account property | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Account Name | A unique name for the account. This name is only used within the tags UI. |
| Account ID | Your Google Ads account ID. To find this value, log into Google Ads and navigate to: **[!DNL Tools and Settings]** > **[!DNL Conversions]** > **[!DNL Select a conversion action]** > **[!DNL Tag Setup]** > **[!DNL Install the Tag yourself]**. The account ID string can be found in the code snippet window that starts with `AW-` or `d`. |
| Product | Select **[!UICONTROL Google Ads (AdWords)]**. |

When finished, select **[!UICONTROL Add Account]**, then select **[!UICONTROL Save]**.

### Add a send conversion action {#conversion-action-tags}

After installing the extension, you can start including conversion actions in your tag rules. When creating or editing a rule that listens to the conversion you'd like to enhance, select **[!UICONTROL Add]** under [!UICONTROL Actions]. In the next dialog, select **[!UICONTROL Google Global Site Tag (gtag)]** from the [!UICONTROL Extension] dropdown, then select **[!UICONTROL Send an event]** under [!UICONTROL Action Type].

![](../../../images/extensions/google-ads-enhanced-conversions/select-action.png)

Additional control appear that allow you to configure the [!DNL gtag] event. At a minimum, the following fields must be filled out: 

1. **[!UICONTROL Event Name (Action)]**: Enter `conversion` as the value.
1. Add a new field where the key is `transaction_id` and the value is a [data element](../../../ui/managing-resources/data-elements.md) that contains the [transaction ID](https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/6386790) value.
1. **[!UICONTROL Conversion Label]**: Enter the appropriate conversion label from your Google Ads account. To find this value, log into Google Ads and navigate to **[!DNL Tools and Settings]** > **[!DNL Conversions]** > **[!DNL Select a conversion action]** > **[!DNL Tag Setup]** > **[!DNL Use Google Tag Manager]**. The conversion label can be found under [!DNL Instructions]. 
    >[!IMPORTANT]
    >
    >While you are in the tag setup area of your Google Ads account, make sure that enhanced conversions is enabled by reviewing and accepting the Terms of Service, selecting **[!DNL Turn on enhanced conversions]**, and selecting **[!DNL API]** as the implementation method. 

When you are finished configuring the action, select **[!UICONTROL Keep Changes]** to add the action to the rule configuration. When you are satisfied with the rule, select **[!UICONTROL Save to Library]**. 

Finally, publish a new [build](../../../ui/publishing/builds.md) to enable the changes to the library.

## Send first-party data using event forwarding 

Once you are sending conversion events from the client side, you can enhance these conversions using the Enhanced Conversions event forwarding extension.

### Create a Google OAuth 2 secret and data element {#create-secret-data-element}

Before configuring the extension, you must create an access token in event forwarding to authenticate to Google Ads API.

See the guide on [creating event forwarding secrets](../../../ui/event-forwarding/secrets.md) for detailed steps. Ensure that you select **[!UICONTROL Google OAuth 2]** as the secret type. Continue following the prompts,  and when asked to select a Google Account profile, select the account that has access to the conversion action you are configuring. 

Once the secret is created, [create a new data element](../../../ui/managing-resources/data-elements.md#create-a-data-element) and select **[!UICONTROL Secret]** for the data element type. Select the appropriate Google OAuth 2 secret for each environment and select **[!UICONTROL Save to Library]**. 

### Configure and install the Enhanced Conversions extension

Find the extension in the event forwarding catalog and select **[!UICONTROL Install]**. 

![](../../../images/extensions/google-ads-enhanced-conversions/install-enhanced-conversions.png)

To configure the extension, you must populate the two required fields:

1. **[!UICONTROL Customer ID]**: The ID that uniquely identifies your Google Ads account. To find this value, log into Google Ads and navigate to **[!DNL Help]** > **[!DNL Customer ID]**.
1. **[!UICONTROL Access Token Data Element]**: Select the data element icon (![Data element icon](../../../images/extensions/google-ads-enhanced-conversions/data-element-icon.png)) and choose the Google OAuth 2 secret data element that you [configured in the previous step](#create-secret-data-element) from the menu.

When finished, select **[!UICONTROL Save]** to install the extension.

### Add a Send Conversion action {#conversion-action-event-forwarding}

After installing the extension, you can start including [!UICONTROL Send Conversion] actions in your event forwarding rules. When creating or editing a rule that listens to the conversion you'd like to enhance, select **[!UICONTROL Add]** under [!UICONTROL Actions]. In the next dialog, select **[!UICONTROL Google Ads Enhanced Conversions]** from the [!UICONTROL Extension] dropdown, then select **[!UICONTROL Send an event]** under [!UICONTROL Action Type].

Navigate to or create an event forwarding rule that listens to the conversion you'd like to enhance and select the Plus icon to add a new action. Select **[!UICONTROL Google Ads Enhanced Conversions]** extension from the Extension dropdown.â€¯ 

Complete, at minimum, these fields: 

* Customer ID
*   To find Customer ID log into Google Ads and navigate to: Help ðŸ¡ª Customer ID 
* Conversion ID or Conversion Label 
    * This is the Account ID you found earlier that starts with AW- or AU- without the AW- or AU- 
    * To find the Account ID log into Google Ads and navigate to: Tools and Settings ðŸ¡ª Conversions ðŸ¡ªSelect a conversion action ðŸ¡ª Tag Setup ðŸ¡ª Use Google Tag Manager ðŸ¡ª find "Conversion ID" and "Conversion Label"

* At least one of the three user identifiers must be included: 
    * Email 
    * Phone Number 
    * Full Address 

Pro Tip: User identification data must be hashed before it is sent to Google. If the data is not hashed when event forwarding receives it toggle the hashing feature on a given field to instruct the extension to hash the value 

Select "Keep Changes" and "Save to Library"
