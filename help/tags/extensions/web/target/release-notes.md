# Adobe Target release notes

>[!NOTE]
>
>Adobe Experience Platform Launch has been rebranded as a suite of data collection technologies in Adobe Experience Platform. Several terminology changes have rolled out across the product documentation as a result. Please refer to the following [document](../../../term-updates.md) for a consolidated reference of the terminology changes.

## July 24, 2020

### Adobe Target Extension 0.11.3

* Fixed a bug when the extension fails if a script or code adds `default` property to the `window` or `document`

## June 15, 2020

### Adobe Target Extension 0.11.2

* Fixed an issue when using CNAME and edge override, where at.js 1.x might incorrectly create the server domain, resulting in the Target request failing

## March 25, 2020

### Adobe Target Extension 0.11.1

## October 10, 2019

### Adobe Target Extension 0.11.0

* Updated at.js to v1.8.
* Improved performance for integrations between Experience Cloud ID library (ECID) v4.4 and at.js 1.8.
* Previously, the ECID library made two blocking calls before at.js could fetch experiences. This has been reduced to a single call, which significantly improves performance.

>[!NOTE]
>Please upgrade your ECID tag extension for Adobe Experience Platform to v4.4.1 to take advantage of this performance enhancement.
