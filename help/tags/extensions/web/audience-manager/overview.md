# Adobe Audience Manager extension overview

>[!NOTE]

>Adobe Experience Platform Launch has been rebranded as a suite of data collection technologies in Adobe Experience Platform. Several terminology changes have rolled out across the product documentation as a result. Please refer to the following [document](../../../term-updates.md) for a consolidated reference of the terminology changes.

With the Audience Manager tag extension, you can integrate the DIL code used by Audience Manager with your properties in Adobe Experience Platform.

Use this reference for information about the options available when using this extension to build a rule.

Use the Code Editor to configure the siteCatalyst.init file.

You can also create a note containing information about this configuration.

Add initialization properties used by [DIL.create](https://experiencecloud.adobe.com/resources/help/en_US/aam/r_dil_create.html) and the namespace subproperty for the [visitorService object](https://experiencecloud.adobe.com/resources/help/en_US/aam/r_dil_visitor_service.html). Two sample use cases are included in the code comments, in the Code Editor.
