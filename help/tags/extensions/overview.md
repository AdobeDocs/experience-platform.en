# Tag and event forwarding extensions

>[!NOTE]
>
>Adobe Experience Platform Launch has been rebranded as a suite of data collection technologies in Adobe Experience Platform. Several terminology changes have rolled out across the product documentation as a result. Please refer to the following [document](../term-updates.md) for a consolidated reference of the terminology changes.

An extension is a packaged set of code that extends the functionalities provided by tags or event forwarding. If you install an extension in a library, the extension adds a set of unique events, conditions, and/or actions that can be employed in that library's [rule configurations](../ui/managing-resources/rules.md).

For more details on how extensions work within the tags and event forwarding frameworks, see the [extensions overview](../ui/managing-resources/extensions/overview.md).

For documentation on how to install and use available extensions, refer to the following catalogs:

* [Tag extensions (client-side)](./client/overview.md)
* [Event forwarding extensions (server-side)](./server/overview.md)

## Third-party extensions {#third-party}

In addition to extensions developed by Adobe, the catalog also includes extensions created by third-party developers.

Adobe does not warranty these third-party extensions, and therefore it is the responsibility of extension authors to choose a license and support process for their extensions. Many developers have chosen to post the source code of their extension packages on a public GitHub repository where users can review them at their convenience. Refer to the [Connections Developers group on GitHub](https://github.com/Connections-Developers) for more information.
