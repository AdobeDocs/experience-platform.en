# Hosts overview

>[!NOTE]
>
>Adobe Experience Platform Launch has been rebranded as a suite of data collection technologies in Adobe Experience Platform. Several terminology changes have rolled out across the product documentation as a result. Please refer to the following [document](../../../term-updates.md) for a consolidated reference of the terminology changes.

Extensions, rules, and data elements are building blocks. When you want to make your application do something, these building blocks are added to libraries and then a library is "built" into a build. Those builds are delivered to a hosted location.

Hosts define available destinations where the builds can be delivered. They come in two types:

* [Managed by Adobe](./managed-by-adobe-host.md) 
* [SFTP](./sftp-host.md)

For detailed information about each host type, please use the links above.

The same host can be used for multiple environments within a property.

For more information to help you decide between self-hosting and having Adobe manage the hosting for you, please read the [self-hosting guide](./self-hosting-libraries.md).
