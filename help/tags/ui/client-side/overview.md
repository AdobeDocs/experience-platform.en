# Client-side information

>[!NOTE]
>
>Adobe Experience Platform Launch is being rebranded as a suite of data collection technologies in Experience Platform. Several terminology changes have rolled out across the product documentation as a result. Please refer to the following [document](../../term-updates.md) for a consolidated reference of the terminology changes.

This section contains information that is useful when managing client-side tag operations in Adobe Experience Platform.

* [**The Tag `_satellite` Object Reference**](satellite-object.md)

  This reference documents the `_satellite` object and the things you can do with it.

* [**Asynchronous Deployment of Experience Cloud JavaScript**](asynchronous-deployment.md)

  Performance and non-blocking deployment of the JavaScript libraries required by our products is increasingly important to Adobe Experience Cloud users. Tools like [[!DNL Google PageSpeed]](https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/) recommend that users change they way they deploy the [!DNL Adobe] libraries on their site. This article explains how to use the Adobe JavaScript libraries in an asynchronous fashion.

* [**Content Security Policy**](content-security-policy.md) (CSP) is a tool to help detect and mitigate certain types of browser-based attacks, such as cross site scripting (XSS).  This article describes the impact of CSP on tag implementations and what you can do about it.
