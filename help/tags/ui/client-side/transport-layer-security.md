# Transport Layer Security (TLS) Information

>[!NOTE]
>
>Adobe Experience Platform Launch has been rebranded as a suite of data collection technologies in Adobe Experience Platform. Several terminology changes have rolled out across the product documentation as a result. Please refer to the following [document](../../term-updates.md) for a consolidated reference of the terminology changes.

TLS is a cryptographic protocol that provides end-to-end security of data sent between applications over the Internet.

>[!NOTE]
>
> For more detailed information on TLS, refer to the [TLS internetsociety docs](https://www.internetsociety.org/deploy360/tls/basics/).

Tags in Adobe Experience Platform are a tag management system that is designed to dynamically load scripts on your website. TLS secures the communication between the Adobe host `assets.adobedtm.com` and your website when these scripts are loaded.

Various versions of TLS exist along with a number of different ciphers it supports. Not all versions and ciphers are the same as some are considered less or more secure than others.

### Supported TLS versions and Ciphers

The following TLS versions and ciphers are currently supported by the Adobe host option.

```
PORT    STATE SERVICE
443/tcp open  https
| ssl-enum-ciphers:
|   TLSv1.2:
|     ciphers:
|       TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384 (secp256r1) - A
|       TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256 (secp256r1) - A
|       TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_CHACHA20_POLY1305_SHA256 (secp256r1) - A
|       TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_CHACHA20_POLY1305_SHA256 (secp256r1) - A
|       TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384 (secp256r1) - A
|       TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256 (secp256r1) - A
|     compressors:
|       NULL
|     cipher preference: server
|   TLSv1.3:
|     ciphers:
|       TLS_AKE_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256 (secp256r1) - A
|       TLS_AKE_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384 (secp256r1) - A
|       TLS_AKE_WITH_CHACHA20_POLY1305_SHA256 (secp256r1) - A
|     cipher preference: client
|_  least strength: A
```

### Self-hosting

If you are [self-hosting](../publishing/hosts/self-hosting-libraries.md) your library, then the TLS versions supported will be determined by your own hosting service.

### TLS Ciphers to be removed May 1st 2024
