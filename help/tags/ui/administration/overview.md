# Administration overview

>[!NOTE]
>
>Adobe Experience Platform Launch has been rebranded as a suite of data collection technologies in Adobe Experience Platform. Several terminology changes have rolled out across the product documentation as a result. Please refer to the following [document](../../term-updates.md) for a consolidated reference of the terminology changes.

The following documents contain information that is useful for tag administrators in Adobe Experience Platform:

* [User permissions](user-permissions.md): Learn about the user management process and the available access rights for tags.
* [Companies and properties](companies-and-properties.md): A property, or web property, is a collection of rules, data elements, configured extensions, environments, and libraries.
