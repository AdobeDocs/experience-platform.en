# Supported browsers

>[!NOTE]
>
>Adobe Experience Platform Launch has been rebranded as a suite of data collection technologies in Adobe Experience Platform. Several terminology changes have rolled out across the product documentation as a result. Please refer to the following [document](../term-updates.md) for a consolidated reference of the terminology changes.

The tag runtime in Adobe Experience Platform (delivered to clients' websites) is compatible with multiple browsers:

- Chrome (latest)
- Safari (latest)
- Firefox (latest)
- Edge (latest)
- iOS Safari (latest)
- Android Chrome (latest)

Any extension code included in the runtime should also strive to support these browsers.

The Data Collection UI is designed to support the following browsers:

- Chrome (latest)
- Safari (latest)
- Firefox (latest)
- Edge (latest)

Any extension code displayed in within the Data Collection UI should also strive to support these browsers.
