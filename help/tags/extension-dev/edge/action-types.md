# Action types for edge extensions

>[!NOTE]
>
>Adobe Experience Platform Launch is being rebranded as a suite of data collection technologies in Experience Platform. Several terminology changes have rolled out across the product documentation as a result. Please refer to the following [document](../../term-updates.md) for a consolidated reference of the terminology changes.

An action-type library module is designed to take a predefined action. The effect of this action is entirely defined by the author. The module could be created as a beacon or even transform some data from the event.

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>This document covers action types for edge extensions. If you are developing a web extension, see the guide on [action types for web extensions](../web/action-types.md) instead.
>
>This document also assumes you are familiar with library modules and how they are integrated in tag extensions. If you require an introduction, see the overview on [library module formatting](./format.md) before returning to this guide.

For example, a module to forward some data to a third-party party endpoint may look like this.

```js
module.exports = (context) {
  const { arc, utils } = context;
  const { fetch } = utils;
  const { event: { xdm } } = arc;
  return fetch('http://someendpoint.com', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: {
      'Content-Type': 'application/json'
    },
    body: JSON.stringify(xdm)
  })
};
```

If you want to make the endpoint configurable by the user, and allow the input and persistence of an endpoint to the settings object within the module, the object would look similar to this.

```json
{
  "endpoint": "http://someendpoint.com"
}
```

In order to operate on the user-defined endpoint, your module would need to change to the following example.

```js
module.exports = (context) {
  const { arc, utils } = context;
  const { fetch } = utils;
  const { event: { xdm } } = arc;
  const  { endpoint } = settings;
  return fetch(endpoint, {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: {
      'Content-Type': 'application/json'
    },
    body: JSON.stringify(xdm)
  })
};
```

## Action result

The result returned by an action module can be anything. If the action needs to execute an asynchronous task, you can return a [promise](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise) that returns the result you want once it resolves.

The action result is stored inside a `ruleStash` key that is made available to all modules through the `context` parameter (`context.arc.ruleStash`). You can learn more about `ruleStash` [here](./context.md#rulestash).
