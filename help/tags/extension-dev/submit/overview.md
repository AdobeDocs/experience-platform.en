# Extension submission process overview

>[!NOTE]
>
>Adobe Experience Platform Launch is being rebranded as a suite of data collection technologies in Experience Platform. Several terminology changes have rolled out across the product documentation as a result. Please refer to the following [document](../../launch-term-updates.md) for a consolidated reference of the terminology changes.

Submitting an extension to the data collection catalog in Adobe Experience Platform can appear to be a daunting task. This document provides a step by step guide to submitting your extension through the use of individual sequential guides. In order to submit your extension, you will need to complete the following steps:

1. [Set up an Adobe Experience Cloud organization](./setup.md)
1. [Grant user access for extension development](./access.md)
1. [Develop an extension](./develop.md)
1. [Create an exchange listing](./create-listing.md)
1. Create your extension package
1. [Upload and test your extension](./upload-and-test.md)
1. [Release your extension](./release.md)

Select the appropriate link for more information on each of these steps.

Support is available via the tags developer community Slack workspace as you are building and testing your extension.
