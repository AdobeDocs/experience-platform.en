# Create an extension package zip file

To ready an extension package for uploading in Adobe Experience Platform, consult the API docs for the [@adobe/reactor-packager](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@adobe/reactor-packager) command-line tool. It outputs a prepared zip file in the expected format for [uploading an extension](./upload-and-test.md).
