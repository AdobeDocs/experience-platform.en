# Create an extension package zip file

>[!NOTE]
>
>Adobe Experience Platform Launch has been rebranded as a suite of data collection technologies in Adobe Experience Platform. Several terminology changes have rolled out across the product documentation as a result. Please refer to the following [document](../../term-updates.md) for a consolidated reference of the terminology changes.

To ready an extension package for uploading in Adobe Experience Platform, consult the API docs for the [@adobe/reactor-packager](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@adobe/reactor-packager) command-line tool. It outputs a prepared zip file in the expected format for [uploading an extension](./upload-and-test.md).
