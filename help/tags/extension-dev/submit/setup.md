# Experience Cloud organization setup

>[!NOTE]
>
>Adobe Experience Platform Launch has been rebranded as a suite of data collection technologies in Adobe Experience Platform. Several terminology changes have rolled out across the product documentation as a result. Please refer to the following [document](../../term-updates.md) for a consolidated reference of the terminology changes.

To develop tag extensions in Adobe Experience Platform it is necessary to register an Adobe Experience Cloud organization.

Experience Cloud customers are assigned an organization when contracts are signed. If you are an existing customer and already have an organization registered then you can skip this document and proceed to the guide on [granting user access for extension development](./access.md). If you are not an Experience Cloud customer, you can have an organization created by joining one of the Adobe partner programs listed below.

## Exchange Partner Program

This program is for partners who have technology that's complimentary to Adobe and can be integrated with Adobe technologies to add value to our mutual customers. This program maintains a [marketplace](https://www.adobeexchange.com/experiencecloud.html) where partners can create listings that promote their integrations. You can see the registration guide [here](https://partners.adobe.com/exchangeprogram/experiencecloud/reg-guide.html) and you can begin your registration [here](https://partners.adobe.com/exchangeprogram/experiencecloud/prereg.html).

You must be a member of this program in order to create publicly listed tag extensions for Adobe Experience Platform that will show in the marketplace.

>[!WARNING]
>
>If you register for the Exchange Partner Program at the link above, you may notice language regarding a fee charged when joining as an Innovate partner after six months. This fee does not apply to extension developers who are joining the Exchange program solely to create extensions. You will not be charged any fees.

## Solution Partner Program (SPP)

This program is for consulting firms that help Adobe customers make the most of their investments and partners that resell Adobe solutions. For a step by step guide on how to join the Solution Partner Program navigate to [the Adobe Spark website](https://spark.adobe.com/page/7PKZzIJJjkcDd/), or for more information visit [the Solution Partner Program site](https://solutionpartners.adobe.com/home.html).

>[!NOTE]
>
>Solution Partners must also [register](https://partners.adobe.com/exchangeprogram/experiencecloud/prereg.html) for the Exchange Partner Program as the Exchange agreement contains the terms and conditions for Adobe Experience Platform extension development.
>
>Before you complete your Exchange registration, please email the Exchange admin at <ExchangeHelpEC@adobe.com> and explain that you are registering so that you can promote your extension. Failure to do this will likely result in your application being denied and instead refer you to the SPP. 
>
>Currently your corporate email can only be used in one partner program at a time, so you will need to use a different corporate email as the registered contact for each of the programs.

Once your company is in the Exchange Partner program, you can request access to Adobe Solutions by signing in to the [Exchange Partner Site](https://partners.adobe.com/exchangeprogram/experiencecloud) and following the steps below.

If you have an Experience Cloud Account require access the Data Collection UI and Experience Platform UI, please see the [data collection permissions  guide](../../../collection/permissions.md).

## For independent developers

If you are an independent developer, or you are otherwise unable to join one of the partner programs listed and you would like to build tag extensions for Adobe Experience Platform, please send an email to launch-ext-dev@adobe.com to request access. Please provide some background on your experience with tags in Adobe Experience Platform, and your planned extension project roadmap.
