# Grant user access

>[!NOTE]
>
>Adobe Experience Platform Launch has been rebranded as a suite of data collection technologies in Adobe Experience Platform. Several terminology changes have rolled out across the product documentation as a result. Please refer to the following [document](../../term-updates.md) for a consolidated reference of the terminology changes.

Before you get started with your `extension_package`, you need to set up your team members with user accounts and permissions.  This is accomplished in the [Adobe Admin Console](https://adminconsole.adobe.com/).

## Configure user permissions for Experience Platform and Data Collection

In order for a user to access tag features, an administrator must add their accounts to a product profile in Adobe Admin Console, which grants the user access to specific properties and Data Collection capabilities. For more information on how to grant permissions for Data Collection, see the [Data Collection permissions guide](../../../collection/permissions.md).

## Confirm provisioning

After your company is provisioned with access to tags and your users are set up as described above, you should be able to access the Data Collection UI and Experience Platform UI from the [Adobe Experience Cloud dashboard](https://experience.adobe.com/). If you still cannot access either UI after completing the above steps, please contact your Adobe account team.
