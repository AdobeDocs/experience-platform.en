# Terminology updates

Adobe Experience Platform Launch is being integrated into Adobe Experience Platform as a suite of data collection technologies. Rather than being a separate service from Experience Platform, Platform Launch's constituent features are now considered capabilities of Platform as a whole.

For this reason, Platform Launch and several related capabilities are being renamed and rebranded. The UI in Adobe Experience Platform that provides these capabilities has now been renamed as the Data Collection UI.

The following table outlines the terms that have been updated across the product documentation:

| Previous term | Updated term |
|---|---|
| Platform Launch (Client Side) | [Tags](./home.md) |
| Platform Launch Server Side | [Event forwarding](./ui/event-forwarding/overview.md) |
| Edge configurations  |  [Datastreams](/help/datastreams/overview.md) |
