## Create a development sandbox {#create-development-sandbox}

To get started and get access to the [[!UICONTROL Use Case Playbooks]](/help/use-case-playbooks/playbooks/overview.md) functionality, [create a new development sandbox](/help/sandboxes/ui/user-guide.md#create) (make sure you do not select a production sandbox) with the name (not the title) containing either `-ucp` or `-UCP` in the suffix, as shown below.

You should now see [!UICONTROL Playbooks] in the left rail under [!UICONTROL Use Case Playbooks] or under [!UICONTROL Marketer Playground].

If you do not see [!UICONTROL Playbooks] in the left rail as shown above, use this link `https://experience.adobe.com/#/@<YOUR_ORG>/sname:<YOUR_SANDBOX_NAME>/platform/mexp/templates` to navigate there directly. In the link, `<YOUR_ORG>` is the name of your organization and `<YOUR_SANDBOX_NAME>` is the name of the development sandbox you created. 

### Sandbox configuration for Adobe Journey Optimizer users {#sandbox-configuration-journey-optimizer}

If your organization is licensed for [Adobe Journey Optimizer](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/journey-optimizer/using/ajo-home.html?lang=en), you'll need to configure the channel presets in your sandbox, which define the technical parameters required for your messages. [Learn how to set up channel surfaces in Adobe Journey Optimizer](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/journey-optimizer/using/configuration/channel-surfaces.html).

## Grant your team the required access permissions {#grant-access-permissions}

* Marketing operations team members who want to create instances from playbooks can get **read and write** permissions.
