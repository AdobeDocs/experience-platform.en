## Create a development sandbox {#create-development-sandbox}

To get started and get access to the Use Case playbooks functionality, [create a new development sandbox](/help/sandboxes/ui/user-guide.md#create) (make sure you do not select a production sandbox) with the name (not the title) containing either `-ucp` or `-UCP` in the suffix, as shown below.

![Create a development sandbox for use case playbooks](/help/use-case-playbooks/assets/playbooks/get-started/create-sandbox-ucp.png)

You should now see [!UICONTROL Playbooks] in the left rail under [!UICONTROL Use Case Playbooks] or under [!UICONTROL Marketer Playground].

If you do not see [!UICONTROL Playbooks] in the left rail as shown above, use this link `https://experience.adobe.com/#/@<YOUR_ORG>/sname:<YOUR_SANDBOX_NAME>/platform/mexp/templates` to navigate there directly. In the link, `<YOUR_ORG>` is the name of your organization and `<YOUR_SANDBOX_NAME>` is the name of the development sandbox you created. 

### Sandbox configuration for Adobe Journey Optimizer users {#sandbox-configuration-journey-optimizer}

If your organization is licensed for Adobe Journey Optimizer, configure the sandbox for Journey Optimizer presets for email, push, and SMS channels.

## Grant your team the required access permissions {#grant-access-permissions}

To get started with [!UICONTROL Use Case Playbooks], the members of your marketing operations team need the right permissions. You can grant your team permissions as follows:

* Marketing operations team members who only want to browse the playbooks can get **read** permission.
* Marketing operations team members who want to create instances from playbooks can get **read and write** permissions.
