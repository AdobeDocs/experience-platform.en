Each playbook includes information about the specific use case it solves. After you enable it, the playbook generates projects with specific assets like schemas, segments, or journeys that are tailored to your use case and are reusable in Experience Platform. Start using these assets or make edits to them before you using them and sharing them with your team in Real-time CDP or Journey Optimizer.

## Availability

Some use case playbooks are tailored to Real-time CDP use cases while others are best suited for customers using Journey Optimizer. Browse the catalog to find the playbooks best suited to your product and use case.
