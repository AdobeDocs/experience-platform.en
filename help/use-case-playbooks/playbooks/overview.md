Each playbook includes information about the specific use case that it solves. 

If you select a Real-Time CDP playbook, your objective might be to generate audiences that you can then map to a destination to run a marketing campaign. 

If you select an Adobe Journey Optimizer playbook, your objective might be to construct a customer journey within your product, and send relevant messaging to your customers.  

Create an instance of a playbook to generate specific assets like schemas, segments, or journeys that are tailored to your use case and are reusable in Experience Platform. The purpose of these objects is to help you understand all the resources that are required to implement your specific use case. They do not contain any data and are created on development sandboxes. Start using these assets or make edits to them before using them and sharing them with your team in Real-time CDP or Journey Optimizer. 

## Availability

Some [!UICONTROL Use Case Playbooks] are tailored to Real-time CDP use cases while others are best suited for customers using Journey Optimizer. Browse the catalog to find the playbooks best suited to your product and use case.

## UI guides

After you decide on the playbook that you want to use, select it from the UI and get started with it.
