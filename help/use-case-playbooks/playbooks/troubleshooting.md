For the beta release of [!UICONTROL Use Case Playbooks], note the troubleshooting tips and known limitations.

## Known limitations {#known-limitations}

When you create a new instance of a playbook, new assets get generated. For generated schemas however, if a schema gets generated in one instance of a playbook, and you edit it, then another schema *will not* get generated if you enable another instance of the playbook. Instead, you will continue to use the schema you edited within the new instance as well.
