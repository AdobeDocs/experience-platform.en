# Overview of data awareness in Use Case Playbooks

Use case playbooks are marketing templates that are designed to generate assets such as audiences, schemas, or journeys for common marketing use cases. Within Adobe Experience Platform, these templates reference several standard fields and field groups. However, in certain cases, you may already have your own custom schemas, fields, and field groups. This might make the assets generated by the use case templates, such as journeys incompatible with your data. Read this tutorial to understand how to use data awareness functionality to better align and complement the generated assets with your existing assets.

## Prerequisistes {#prerequisites}

Before reading this tutorial, browse the [available use case playbook templates](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-platform/use-case-playbooks/playbooks/discover.html?lang=en#search-and-filter) and [create an instance](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-platform/use-case-playbooks/playbooks/create-share-reuse.html?lang=en#create-playbook-instance) of a preferred playbook.

Creating an instance generates a set of assets such as journeys, segments, schemas, and messages in the inspirational sandbox.

### Create and publish a package {#create-publish-package}

1. To import objects from the inspirational sandbox into another sandbox, browse to a desired instance of a use case playbook, and select **[!UICONTROL Publish to a different sandbox]** to export the artifacts as a package.

2. Once you select the **[!UICONTROL Publish to a different sandbox]** button, a modal appears. Fill in the name and optional description and select **[!UICONTROL Create]**. This step bundles the generated assets into a package that can be imported into a different sandbox.

1. Now, navigate to the **Sandboxes** page in the left side navigation and select the **Packages** tab, find your package and publish it. In this example, the package is already published but in order to publish a package, follow the steps in the [sandbox tooling](/help/sandboxes/ui/sandbox-tooling.md) document. 

2. After the publish succeeds, on the packages browse page you should see a **+** button enabled next to the name. 

>[!NOTE]
>
> The package cannot be imported while it is still in draft mode, so open the package detail page and publish the package.

5. Select the **+** control, to start the workflow to import the assets generated by the use case playbook into the **[!UICONTROL Target sandbox]**. Select a target sandbox and confirm the package name you want to import using the dropdown. Add the job details such as job name and job description before proceeding to the next step.

>[!NOTE]
>
> You can import packages only into other development sandboxes. The production sandbox is disabled for such imports.

In the **[!UICONTROL View dependencies]** step, you can map schemas. The **[!UICONTROL Finish]** button is disabled until you map each schema.

### Map schemas {#map-schemas}

1. Map the first schema. The schema mapping dialog displays a picker to select the target schema. If the source schema is a profile schema, then there are no other target schema options besides the [individual union profile schema](/help/xdm/classes/individual-profile.md). When you load the page, autogenerated mapping recommendations are displayed, but you can be modify them by selecting the target field and then selecting a new field. If you make changes to the suggested mappings, use the **Validate** button to validate the new mappings and display any errors that may be linked to the new mappings. Select **Save** once the mapping is complete.

2. Continue mapping all the schemas in the package. If the schema is an [event schema](/help/xdm/classes/experienceevent.md), the dialog shows a dropdown where you can view all the event schemas in the target sandbox.

3. Select a schema from available schemas in the **Target sandbox**.

4. Complete the mapping and select **Save**.

5. Once all schemas have been mapped, select **Finish** to complete the import workflow.

### Import status {#import-status}

1. You are automatically redirected to the [**Imports**](/help/sandboxes/ui/sandbox-tooling.md) page where you can see the progress of your import.

![Page showing import progress](/help/use-case-playbooks/assets/playbooks/data-awareness/import-progress.png)

1. While the package is importing, the assets of the package are being created in the target sandbox. Once complete, they will reference the fields that you just mapped to in the import process. The process is now complete and the assets from the inspirational sandbox are now also present in your target sandbox for you to test.
