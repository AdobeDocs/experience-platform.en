# Overview of data awareness in Use Case Playbooks

Use case playbooks are marketing templates that are designed to generate assets such as audiences, schemas, or journeys for common marketing use cases. Within Adobe Experience Platform, these templates reference several standard fields and field groups. However, in certain cases, you may have already set up your own schemas, fields, and field groups. This could make some of the assets generated by the use case templates, such as journeys, incompatible with your data. To understand how to use data awareness functionality to better align and complement the generated assets with your existing assets, read this tutorial.

## Prerequisites {#prerequisites}

Before reading this tutorial, browse the [available use case playbook templates](/help/use-case-playbooks/playbooks/discover.md#search-and-filter) and [create an instance](/help/use-case-playbooks/playbooks/create-share-reuse.md) of a preferred playbook.

Creating an instance generates a set of assets such as journeys, segments, schemas, and messages in the inspirational sandbox. Read on to learn how you can copy these assets into other sandboxes.

### Create and publish a package {#create-publish-package}

1. To import objects from the inspirational sandbox into another sandbox, browse to a desired instance of a use case playbook, and select **[!UICONTROL Publish to a different sandbox]** to export the artifacts as a package.

    ![GIF showing the different use case instances](/help/use-case-playbooks/assets/playbooks/data-awareness/browse-to-existing-instances-of-playbook.gif)

2. Once you select the **[!UICONTROL Publish to a different sandbox]** button, a modal appears. Fill in the name and optional description and select **[!UICONTROL Create]**. This step bundles the generated assets into a package that can be imported into a different sandbox.

3. Navigate to the **Sandboxes** page in the left side navigation and select the **Packages** tab, find your package, and publish it. To publish a package that is in draft state, follow the steps in the [sandbox tooling](/help/sandboxes/ui/sandbox-tooling.md#add-an-object-to-an-existing-package-and-publish) document.

    ![Publishing the package](/help/use-case-playbooks/assets/playbooks/data-awareness/publish-draft.png) 

4. After the publish succeeds, on the packages browse page you should see a **+** button enabled next to the name. 

    ![Packages tab in the Sandboxes page](/help/use-case-playbooks/assets/playbooks/data-awareness/packages.png)

    >[!NOTE]
    >
    > The package cannot be imported while it is still in draft mode, so open the package detail page and publish the package.

5. Select the **+** control and start the workflow to import the assets generated by the use case playbook into the **[!UICONTROL Target sandbox]**. Select a target sandbox and confirm the package name that you want to import using the dropdown. Add the job details such as job name and job description before proceeding to the next step.

    >[!NOTE]
    >
    > You can import packages only into other development sandboxes. The production sandbox is disabled for such imports.

6. In the **[!UICONTROL View dependencies]** step, you can map schemas and copy other assets from the inspirational sandbox into the target sandbox. The **[!UICONTROL Finish]** button is disabled until you map each schema.

    ![Map schemas in the 'View dependencies' step, enabling Finish button.](/help/use-case-playbooks/assets/playbooks/data-awareness/import-package-view-dependencies.png)

### Map schemas {#map-schemas}

1. Map the first schema. The schema mapping dialog displays a drop-down to select the target schema. If the source schema is a profile schema, then there are no other target schema options besides the [individual union profile schema](/help/xdm/classes/individual-profile.md). You can see automatically generated mapping recommendations between Source Data and Target Fields when the page is first displayed. You can edit the mappings by selecting the target field and then selecting a new field. If you modify the suggested mappings, use the **Validate** button to validate the new mappings and display any errors that may be linked to the new mappings. Select **Save** once the mapping is complete.

2. Continue mapping all the fields in the schemas. If the schema is an [event schema](/help/xdm/classes/experienceevent.md), the dialog shows a dropdown where you can view all the event schemas in the target sandbox.

   ![Select a target schema from dropdown](/help/use-case-playbooks/assets/playbooks/data-awareness/map-to-event-schema.png)

3. Select a schema from available schemas in the **Target sandbox**.

   ![Select a schema](/help/use-case-playbooks/assets/playbooks/data-awareness/map-to-available-schemas.png)

4. Complete the mapping and select **Save**.

   ![Save mapping](/help/use-case-playbooks/assets/playbooks/data-awareness/map-to-existing-modal.png)

5. Once you've completed mapping all the fields in the schemas, select **Finish** to complete the import workflow.

   ![Finish the flow](/help/use-case-playbooks/assets/playbooks/data-awareness/complete-flow.png)

    >[!NOTE]
    >
    > You can't modify any assets except for the schemas as this is an inspirational sandbox but they do show up as they are dependencies of the package. 

### Import status {#import-status}

1. You are automatically redirected to the [**Imports**](/help/sandboxes/ui/sandbox-tooling.md#view-import-details) page where you can see the progress of your import.

    ![Page showing import progress](/help/use-case-playbooks/assets/playbooks/data-awareness/import-progress.png)

2. While the package is importing, the assets of the package are being created in the target sandbox. Once complete, they reference the fields that you mapped during the import process. The process is now complete and the assets from the inspirational sandbox are now also present in your target sandbox for you to test.

After reading this guide, you now have a better understanding of how to leverage use case playbooks along with [sandbox tooling](/help/sandboxes/ui/sandbox-tooling.md#monitor-import-jobs-and-view-import-objects-details) to create executable journeys that reference your schemas.
