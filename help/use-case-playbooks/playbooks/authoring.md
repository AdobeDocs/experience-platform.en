# Playbook Authoring Framework Overview

The Playbook Authoring Framework is designed to enable marketing analysts and Martech teams to create, manage, and share playbooks efficiently. The framework follows a three-step process:

1. **Metadata capture**: Marketing analysts gather or generate playbook metadata using AI or manual input.
2. **Technical association**: The martech team links technical objects to the playbook.
3. **Playbook distribution**: Playbooks are shared across different subsidiaries and IMS organizations.

So Playbook authoring framework, right?

So it's a three-step process basically. So first is.o a marketing analyst captures all the playbook metadata either manually or generates all of them using AI. OK now once that is done, the metadata is captured which talks about.What this playbook should do after that?
The marketing analyst passes over the button to the Martech team and then the Martech team associates the technical objects with the playbook.
OK.
And then they do some complete some. Cti will show you a demo.
And then the playbook creation is complete.So basically at this stage after step two, they would be able to.
Like create instances for the playbook, OK.
One important point to note here is Serah.
Now displaybooks are something that would be created by customers.
OK.So we are not going to be restrictive about where can they create those playbooks. You know by that I mean.
They they would be able to create their own playbooks in their dev sandbox itself.
And the reason for that is because the customer is creating their own playbooks for their own conjunction.
They would ideally want to use their own schema and their own technical objects, which is lying in the dev sandbox, right?So yeah, so that's a change from whatever we have been doing till now and last after they have created the playbook.The third step is.
They would be.
They'll be able to distribute or share the playbook with their subsidiaries.
By that I mean.
Let's say.
Elian's has a martex Coe Center of Excellence in Germany, so they create their golden playbook.In their martech Center of Excellence in Germany and then.
They can share this playbook with Elian subsidiaries in Elianz, Thailand, elianz.
Australia and so on.
Right.
Now, technically in most cases these are different IMS orgs.So the playbook as an object needs to be distributed between different IMS orgs.
So you, the marketing analyst, captures the metadata of a particular playbook either.

Through a Gen. AI based experience or a manually captures everything through a web form based experience and once the metadata creation is successful.
The Martech team.
Someone from the market team associates technical objects with the playbook.
And then some automations happen.
These are like.
Company our customers will be private to private to this automations.
These are basically things that will run in the back end and then the playbook would be available at customers gallery. Now once the playbook is available in the customer's gallery, they would be able to share this playbook to other IMS orgs.

DEMO:

This is how the playbook homepage looks like. We have a CTA called "New Playbook" to create a playbook.
