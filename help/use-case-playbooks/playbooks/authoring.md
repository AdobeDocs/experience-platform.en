# Playbook Authoring Framework Overview

The Playbook Authoring Framework is designed to enable marketing analysts and Martech teams to create, manage, and share playbooks efficiently within Adobe Experience Platform. 

The playbook authoring framework follows a three-step process:

1. **Metadata capture**: Marketing analysts gather or generate playbook metadata using AI assistance or manual input.

2. **Technical association**: The martech team links specific assets (schemas, segments, profiles) to the playbook. Customers retain full control over playbook creation in their developement sandbox, ensuring alignment with their assets, unique schemas and other data structures.

3. **Playbook distribution**: Playbooks are then shared across different subsidiaries and IMS organizations. For example, Allianz's Martech Center of Excellence in Germany creates a "golden" playbook and distributes it to regional subsidiaries in Thailand, Australia, etc.
