# Overview of schema awareness in Use Case Playbooks

Use case playbooks are marketing templates that are designed to generate technical objects for common marketing use cases. Within Adobe Experience Platform, these templates reference several standard fields and field groups. However, in certain cases, you may already have your own custom schemas, fields, and field groups. This makes the technical artifacts produced by the use case templates, such as journeys incompatible with your data. To better align and enhance schema awareness to those technical artifacts and leverage your existing fields, follow the steps outlined below.

## Get started

### Create and publish a package {#create-publish-package}

* Step 1: First, create an instance from one of the [templates](../playbooks/create-share-reuse.md). Creating an instance generates a set of technical artifacts such as journeys, segments, schemas, and messages in the inspirational sandbox. These artifacts will reference standard fields and field groups, and are active only in the sandbox that has been enabled for usecase playbooks (beta). To import these objects into a different sandbox and add schema awareness, in the **Instance detail** page, select the **[!UICONTROL Publish to a different sandbox]** button to export the artifacts as a package.

* Step 2: Once you select the **Publish to a different sandbox** button, a modal appears. Input the name and optional description and select **Create**. This step bundles the technical artifacts into a package that can be imported into a different sandbox.

* Step 3: Now, navigate to the **Sandboxes** page in the left side navigation and select the **Packages** tab and find your package. The package cannot be imported while it is still in draft mode, so open the package detail page and publish the package. After the publish succeeds, on the packages browse page you should see a **+** button enabled next to the name.

* Step 4: Select the **+** button, to start the workflow to import the technical objects generated by the use case playbook into the **[!UIControl Target sandbox]**. Select a target sandbox using the dropdown and then proceed to the next step.

>[!NOTE]
>
> The package can only be imported into another development sandbox as the production environment is disabled.

* Step 5: You now land on the package dependency page where you can begin to map schemas. The **Finish** button is disabled until you map each schema.

### Map schemas {#map-schemas}

* Step 6: Map the first schema. The schema mapping dialog displays a picker to select the target schema. If the source schema is a profile schema, then there are no other target schema options besides the individual union profile schema. When you load the page, autogenerated mapping recommendations are displayed, but you can be modify them by selecting the target field and then selecting a new field. If you make changes to the suggested mappings, use the **Validate** button to validate the new mappings and display any errors that may be linked to the new mappings. Select **Save** once the mapping is complete.

* Step 7: Continue mapping all the schemas in the package. If the schema is an event schema, the dialog shows a dropdown where you can view all the event schemas in the target sandbox.

* Step 8: Select a schema from available schemas in the **Target sandbox**.

* Step 9: Complete the mapping and select **Save**.

* Step 10: Once all schemas have been mapped, select **Finish** to complete the import workflow.

### Import status {#import-status}

* Step 11: You are automatically redirected to the **Imports** page where you can see the progress of your import.

* Step 12: While the package is importing, the technical artifacts of the package are being created in the target sandbox. Once complete, they will reference the fields that you just mapped to in the import process. The process is now complete and you can now test the journey against your own data.

## Next steps

After reading this guide, you now have a better understanding of how to leverage use case playbooks along with sandbox tooling to create executable journeys that reference your schemas.
