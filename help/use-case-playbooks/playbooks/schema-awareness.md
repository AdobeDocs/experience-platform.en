# Overview of schema awareness in Use Case Playbooks

Use case playbooks are marketing templates that are designed to generate technical objects for common marketing use cases. Within Adobe Experience Platform, these templates reference several standard fields and field groups which help set up your use case playbooks instances quicker while also leveraging any existing data you might already have. However, in certain cases, you may already have your own custom schemas, fields, field groups. This makes the technical artifacts produced by the use case templates, such as journeys incompatible with your data. To better align and enhance schema awareness to those technical artifacts and leverage your existing fields, follow the steps outlined below.

## Get started

* Step 1: First, create an instance from one of the [templates](../playbooks/create-share-reuse.md). Next, in the **[!UICONTROL Bill of Material]** page for that particular instance, select the **[!UICONTROL Publish to a different sandbox]** button.

* Step 2: Once you select the **Publish to a different sandbox** button, a modal appears. Input the name and optional description and select **Create**. This step bundles the technical artifacts into a package that can be imported into a different sandbox.

* Step 3: Now, navigate to the **Sandboxes** page from the side nav, select the **Packages** tab and find your package. Open the package detail page to publish the package. The package cannot be imported while it is still in draft mode, so open the package detail page and publish the package. After the publish succeeds, on the packages browse page you should see a **+** button enabled next to the name.

* Step 4: Select the **+** button to start the workflow to import the technical objects generated by the use case playbook into the **Target sandbox**. Select a target sandbox using the dropdown and then proceed to the next step.

> The package can only be imported into another development sandbox as the production environment is disabled.

* Step 5: You now land on the package dependency page where you can begin to map schemas. The **Finish** button is disabled until you map each schema.

* Step 6: Map the first schema. If the schema is a profile schema, there are no other target schema options besides the individual union profile schema. On load, autogenerated mapping recommendations are displayed, but can be modified by clicking on the target field and selecting a new field. If you make changes to the suggested mappings, the **Validate** button can be used to validate the new mappings and display any errors that may be linked to the new mappings. Select **Save** once the mapping is complete.

* Step 7: Continue mapping all the schemas in the package. If the schema is an event schema, the dialog shows a dropdown where you can view all the event schemas in the target sandbox. Select one of the schemas to map.

* Step 8: Select a schema from available schemas in the **Target sandbox**.

* Step 9: Complete the mapping and select **Save**.

* Step 10: Once all schemas have been mapped, select **Finish** to complete the import workflow.

* Step 11: You are automatically redirected to the **Imports** page where you can see the progress of your import.

* Step 12: While the package is importing, the technical artifacts of the package are being created in the target sandbox. Once complete, they will reference the fields that you just mapped to in the import process. The process is now complete.

## Next steps

After reading this guide, you now have a better understanding of how to leverage use case playbooks along with sandbox tooling to create executable journeys that reference your schemas.
