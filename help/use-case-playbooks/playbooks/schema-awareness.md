# Overview of schema awareness in Use Case Playbooks

Adobe Experience Platform provides several standard fields and field groups which help set up your Usecase Playbooks instances quicker while also leveraging any existing data you might already have. In certain cases, you may already have your own schemas, fields and field groups. To better align your existing fields and enhance schema awareness, follow the steps outlined below using through the beta application.

## Get started

* Step 1: First, create an instance from one of the templates. Next, in the **Bill of Material** page for that particular instance, select the **Publish to a different sandbox** button.

* Step 2: Once you select the **Publish to a different sandbox** button, a modal appears. Input the name and optional description and select **Create**.

* Step 3: Now, navigate to the **Packages** tab in the sandboxes side nav item, packages tab and finds their package. In the packages tab, find your package. When the user publishes the package, they should see the **+** button enabled next to the name.
