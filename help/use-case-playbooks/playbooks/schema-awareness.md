# Overview of schema awareness in Use Case Playbooks

Adobe Experience Platform provides several standard fields and field groups which help set up your Usecase Playbooks instances quicker while also leveraging any existing data you might already have. In certain cases, you may already have your own schemas, fields and field groups. To better align your existing fields and enhance schema awareness, follow the steps outlined below using through the beta application.

## Get started

* Step 1: First, create an instance from one of the templates. Next, in the **Bill of Material** page for that particular instance, select the **Publish to a different sandbox** button.

* Step 2: Once you select the **Publish to a different sandbox** button, a modal appears. Input the name and optional description and select **Create**.

* Step 3: Now, navigate to the **Sandboxes** page from the side nav, select the **Packages** tab and find your package. Open the package detail page to publish the package. After the publish suceeds, on the packages browse page you should see a **+** button enabled next to the name.

* Step 6: Map the first schema. If the schema is a profile schema, there are no other target schema options besides the individual union profile schema. On load, autogenerated mapping recommendations are displayed, but can be modified by clicking on the target field and selecting a new field. Select **Save** once the mapping is complete.

* Step 7: Select a target schema from the dropdown. Map the next schema. If the schema is an event schema, use the dropdown to select the target event schema.
