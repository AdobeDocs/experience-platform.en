If you have reached the limit on the number of sandboxes that have been allocated to you, a message appears asking you to contact your organization administrator to increase the limit or deactivate or remove some active sandboxes. Once your sandbox limit has been adjusted or your number of active sandboxes has been reduced, you can proceed to create the inspirational sandbox.

## Configure sandbox and channel surfaces in Journey Optimizer {#configure-channel-surfaces}

If your organization is licensed for [Adobe Journey Optimizer](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/journey-optimizer/using/ajo-home.html), and you're looking to use the playbooks designed for Journey Optimizer, you'll need to configure the channel presets in your sandbox, which define the technical parameters required for your messages. [Learn how to set up channel surfaces in Adobe Journey Optimizer](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/journey-optimizer/using/configuration/channel-surfaces.html).

To create instances of playbooks in Journey Optimizer, you need to configure channel surfaces for e-mail, push, and SMS notifications. 

### E-mail channel surface

Go to `Channels` in the Journey Optimizer interface. Configure separate subdomains and IP pools for marketing emails and transactional messaging, if not already configured. These are best practices to ensure that transactional messages such as order confirmation e-mails, get through to your customers. Enter names, email addresses, and additional settings. Select **Submit** at the top-right of the page to create the marketing channel surface. Read the documentation on [how to set up e-mail channel surfaces](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/journey-optimizer/using/email/configure-email/email-settings.html).

### SMS channel surface

To create an SMS channel surface, first create an SMS API credential, and select the preferred vendor (for example, Sinch). Name the SMS channel surface (for example, SMS Marketing), select the configuration, and enter a sender number. Select **Submit** at the top-right of the page to save the SMS channel surface. Read the documentation on [how to set up SMS channel surfaces](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/journey-optimizer/using/sms/sms-configuration.html?lang=en#message-preset-sms).

Also configure channels for playbooks that contain transactional messages like order confirmations.

### Push channel surface

Confirm that the app surfaces are configured either from the Experience Platform or Data Collections interface. This is how app surfaces look like in the Data Collections environment.
