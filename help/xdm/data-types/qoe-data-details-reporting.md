# QoE (Quality of Experience) Data Details Reporting data type

[!UICONTROL QoE Data Details] Reporting is a standard Experience Data Model (XDM) data type provides detailed metrics related to the quality of experience (QoE) during media playback. Use the [!UICONTROL QoE Data Details] Reporting data type to capture details such as bitrate information, frame rates, buffering events, dropped frames, and so on. Media reporting fields are used by Adobe services to analyze the Media Collection fields sent by users. This data, alongside other specific user metrics, are computed and reported upon. This data type enables the analysis of playback quality, allowing for insights into streaming performance, user experience, and potential issues encountered during playback sessions.
