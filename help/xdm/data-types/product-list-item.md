# [!UICONTROL Product list item] data type

[!UICONTROL Product list item] is a standard XDM data type that describes a product selected by a customer with specific options, pricing, and usage context for a specific point of time.

The values captured in this data type may differ from the product record. For example, the product record contains details from the product information system that are consistent for all customers, where the product list item has the actual price offered to the customer at the time of purchase, which may vary due to sales campaigns or seasonal pricing.
