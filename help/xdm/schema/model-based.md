* Version descriptor
* Timestamp descriptor (for time-series schemas only)

Explain why each field is required and how it is used.

## Relationship support

Describe how to define relationships between schemas (primary/foreign key), and the benefits of using them with model-based schemas.

## Ingestion methods

Explain the supported methods for writing data to model-based datasets:

* Sources with change data capture (CDC) and the `_change_request_type` column
* Data Distiller
* Local file upload

## Workflow

Provide the recommended step-by-step workflow for creating and using a model-based schema, from schema creation to data ingestion.

## Links to related documentation

Link to relevant tutorials, API references, and application-specific workflows.

## Limitations and considerations
