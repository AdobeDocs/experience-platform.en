# Industry data models overview

Experience Data Model (XDM) allows you to create highly customizable schemas to capture key customer experience data related to your business. To help streamline the process of modeling your data to conform to XDM, Adobe Experience Platform provides a versatile suite of standard XDM components, which capture concepts that are commonly used across several industries.

>[!NOTE]
>
>New standard XDM components are being continuously released to best fit consumer needs. For a list of the most up-to-date components, you can [explore existing resources in the UI](../../ui/explore.md) or refer to the [official XDM repository](https://github.com/adobe/xdm/tree/master/components) on GitHub.

Depending on the industry that your business operates under, some XDM components will be more relevant to your needs than others. In addition, the relationships you establish between your XDM schemas will vary depending on your industry.

In order to help guide your data modeling strategy based on your particular industry, this guide provides a reference of entity relationship diagrams (ERDs) for several supported industry verticals.

## Prerequisites

To read the ERDs referenced in this guide, you must have a working understanding of how XDM components interact to form schemas and how XDM schemas operate in Experience Platform as a whole. Ensure that you have read the following overview documentation before continuing:

* [XDM System overview](../../home.md): Learn how XDM operates in the Platform ecosystem.
* [Basics of schema composition](../../schema/composition.md): Learn how XDM components (such as schema field groups, classes, and data types) contribute to the structure of a schema, as well as the role of identity fields.

It is also recommended that you review the [data modeling best practices guide](../../schema/best-practices.md) for general guidelines on how to map your data to XDM.

## Industry data model ERDs {#erds}

ERDs are provided for the following industry verticals:

* [[!UICONTROL Retail]](./retail.md)
* [[!UICONTROL Financial services]](./financial.md)
* [[!UICONTROL Telecommunications]](./telecom.md)
* [[!UICONTROL Travel and hospitality]](./travel-hospitality.md)
