# [!DNL Privacy Consent] mixin overview

The [!DNL Privacy/Marketing Preferences (Consent)] mixin (hereinafter referred to as the "[!DNL Privacy Consent] mixin") is an [!DNL Experience Data Model] (XDM) mixin that is intended to support the collection of user permissions and preferences generated by CMPs and other sources from customers. This document covers the structure and intended use of the various fields provided by the mixin.

## Prerequisites {#prerequisites}

This document requires a working understanding of [!DNL Experience Data Model] (XDM) and the use of the schemas in [!DNL Experience Platform]. Please review the following documentation before continuing:

* [XDM System overview](http://www.adobe.com/go/xdm-home-en)
* [Basics of schema composition](http://www.adobe.com/go/xdm-schema-best-practices-en)

## Schema example {#schema}

>[!NOTE]
>
>The example below is meant to illustrate the structure of the data that is sent to [!DNL Platform] via the [!DNL Privacy Consent] mixin, in order to give context to the next section in this document which explains the major fields provided by the mixin. A complete example of the schema's structure can found in the [appendix](#full-schema) for reference purposes.

The following JSON shows an example of the type of data the [!DNL Privacy Consent] mixin is able to process. Information on the specific use of each of these fields is provided in the next section.

## Fields {#fields}

The sections below cover the use of each of the major fields provided by the [!DNL Privacy Consent] mixin, and how their subfields should be structured.

### xdm:privacyOptOuts {#privacyOptOuts}

`xdm:privacyOptOuts` is an array that represents general opt-out settings selected by the customer. Several objects can be included in this array, each representing a specific opt-out type and the preferences the customer has selected for that type.

```json
"xdm:privacyOptOuts": [
     {
        "xdm:optOutType": "general_opt_out",
        "xdm:optOutValue": "in",
        "xdm:timestamp": "2019-01-01T15:52:25+00:00",
        "xdm:basisOfProcessing": "legitimate_interest"
     },
     {
        "xdm:optOutType": "device_linking",
        "xdm:optOutValue": "not_provided",
        "xdm:basisOfProcessing": "vital_interest"
     },
     {
        "xdm:optOutType": "anonymous_analysis",
        "xdm:optOutValue": "out"
     }
  ]
```

| Property | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `xdm:optOutType` | The type of opt-out. See the [appendix](#optOutType-values) for accepted values and definitions. |
| `xdm:optOutValue` | The selected preference the customer has chosen for this particular opt-out type. See the [appendix](#choice-optOutValue-values) for accepted values and definitions. |
| `xdm:timestamp` | An ISO 8601 timestamp of when the opt-out preference changed, if applicable. |
| `xdm:basisOfProcessing` | Indicates the privacy-related basis by which the data should be collected and processed. By default, this field is set to `consent`, which indicates that the data should only be processed if the user has provided consent (as reflected in `xdm:optOutValue`).<br><br>In some circumstances, customers do not have be prompted to provide consent for data processing. `xdm:basisOfProcessing` must be included in the opt-out object in these cases, indicating the reason why a consent prompt was not provided. See the [appendix](#basisOfProcessing-values) for accepted values and definitions.  |

### xdm:personalizationPreferences {#personalizationPreferences}

`xdm:personalizationPreferences` captures customer preferences regarding which ways their data can be used for personalization. Users can opt out of specific personalization use cases, or opt out of personalization entirely.

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>`xdm:personalizationPreferences` does not cover marketing use cases. For example, if a customer opts out of personalization for emails, they will not stop receiving emails. Rather, the emails they receive will be generic and not based on their profile.
>
>By the same example, if a customer opts out of email marketing (through `xdm:marketingPreferences`, explained in the [next section](#marketingPreferences)), then that customer will not receive any emails, even if email personalization is permitted.

```json
"xdm:personalizationPreferences": {
     "xdm:default": {
        "xdm:choice": "unknown",
        "xdm:timestamp": "2019-01-01T15:52:25+00:00",

## Ingesting consent data using the mixin {#ingest}

In order to use the [!DNL Privacy Consent] mixin to ingest consent data from your customers, you must add the mixin to a new or existing schema, and create a dataset based on that schema.

See the tutorial on [creating a schema in the UI](http://www.adobe.com/go/xdm-schema-editor-tutorial-en) for steps on how to add mixins to a schema. The[!DNL  Privacy Consent] mixin is compatible with schemas based on the classes [!DNL XDM Individual Profile] or [!DNL XDM ExperienceEvent].

Once you have created a schema containing the [!DNL Privacy Consent] mixin, refer to the the section on [creating a dataset](../../catalog/datasets/user-guide.md#create) in the dataset user guide, following the steps to create a dataset with an existing schema.

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>If you want to send consent data to [!DNL Real-time Customer Profile], it is required that you create a [!DNL Profile]-enabled schema based on the [!DNL XDM Individual Profile] class that contains the [!DNL Privacy Consent] mixin. The dataset that you create based on that schema must also be enabled for [!DNL Profile]. Refer to the tutorials above for specific steps related to [!DNL Real-time Customer Profile] requirements.

## Appendix {#appendix}

The sections below provide additional reference information regarding the [!DNL Privacy Consent] mixin.

### Accepted values for xdm:optOutType {#optOutType-values}

The following table outlines the accepted values for `xdm:optOutType`:

| Value | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `general_opt_out` | The data cannot be used for any purpose. This typically blocks data collection, except when the basis of processing is not "consent".<br><br>When using this opt-out type, the accepted values `in` and `out` obtain the following contextual meaning:<ul><li>`in`: The user **has provided consent** for their data to be used for general processing.</li><li>`out`: The user **does not consent** to their data being used for general processing.</li></ul>See the table on [accepted values for xdm:optOutValue](#choice-optOutValue-values) for more information.|
| `anonymous_analysis` | The data cannot be used for generic web metrics that do not require any type of user ID, such as the number of times a particular page was viewed. |
| `device_linking` | The data from one device used by a visitor cannot be combined with data from another device used by that same visitor. Devices are linked using techniques such as a common username or email address, often via the Adobe device co-op or a private device graph. |
| `pseudonymous_analysis` | The data cannot be used for web metrics provided by Adobe Analytics, which requires pseudonymous IDs to identify paths users take through a website (such as a fallout report), to establish sessions, and for attribution purposes. |
| `sales_sharing_opt_out` | The data cannot be used for sales purposes, or sharing with third parties.<br><br>When using this opt-out type, the accepted values `in` and `out` obtain the following contextual meaning:<ul><li>`in`: The user **has provided consent** for their data to be used for sales and sharing purposes.</li><li>`out`: The user **does not consent** to their data being used for sales and sharing purposes.</li></ul>See the table on [accepted values for xdm:optOutValue](#choice-optOutValue-values) for more information. |

| `consent` **(Default)** | The collection of data for the specified purpose is allowed, given that the individual has provided explicit permission. This is the default value of `xdm:basisOfProcessing` if no other value is provided. <br><br>**IMPORTANT**: The values for `xdm:choice` and `xdm:optOutValue` are only honored when `xdm:basisOfProcessing` is set to `consent`. If any of the other values outlined in this table are used for `xdm:basisOfProcessing` instead, the individual's consent choices are ignored. |
| `compliance` | The collection of data for the specified purpose is required to meet the legal obligations of the business. |
