# XDM field dictionary


[!DNL Experience Data Model] (XDM) defines a set of standard fields that can be used when composing Adobe Experience Platform schemas. Use of these fields results in consistent behavior across [!DNL Platform] services, as all services that consume XDM will explicitly understand the specific definitions provided by these fields.

See the [basics of schema composition](composition.md) for more information regarding the building blocks of schemas, including principles and best practices in defining schemas for [!DNL Experience Platform].

The table below includes the field name (not all XDM fields are namespaced using "xdm") along with its title and description, type, and format where required, as well as its corresponding XDM type and the resources (schemas, schema field groups, and data types) in which the field can be found.

You can use the search functionality in the [!DNL Schema Editor] to view details of these resources, as shown in the [Schema Editor tutorial](../tutorials/create-schema-ui.md#browse).

>[!NOTE]
>
>If a field is marked "**DEPRECATED**", it means that it should no longer be used in new implementations. The field continues to be available for backwards compatibility, but will no longer be supported in future releases.
