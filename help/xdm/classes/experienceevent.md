# [!DNL XDM ExperienceEvent] class

[!DNL XDM ExperienceEvent] is a standard Experience Data Model (XDM) class which allows you to create a timestamped snapshot of the system when a specific event occurs or a certain set of conditions have been reached.

An Experience Event is a fact record of what occurred, including the point in time and identity of the individual involved. Events can be either explicit (directly observable human actions) or implicit (raised without a direct human action) and are recorded without aggregation or interpretation. For more high-level information on the use of this class in the Platform ecosystem, refer to the [XDM overview](../home.md#data-behaviors).

The [!DNL XDM ExperienceEvent] class itself provides several time-series-related fields to a schema. Two of these fields (`_id` and `timestamp`) are **required** for all schemas based on the class, while the rest are optional. The values of some of the fields are automatically populated when data is ingested.

![The structure of XDM ExperienceEvent as it appears in the Platform UI](../images/classes/experienceevent/structure.png)

| Property | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `_id`<br>**(Required)** | The Experience Event Class `_id` field uniquely identifies individual events that are ingested into Adobe Experience Platform. This field is used to track the uniqueness of an individual event, prevent duplication of data, and look up that event in downstream services.<br><br>Where duplicate events are detected, Platform applications and services may handle the duplication differently.  For example, duplicate events in Profile Service are dropped if the event with the same `_id` already exists in the Profile Store.<br><br>In some cases, `_id` can be a [Universally Unique Identifier (UUID)](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4122) or [Globally Unique Identifier (GUID)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.guid?view=net-5.0).<br><br>If you are streaming data from a source connection or ingesting directly from a Parquet file, you should generate this value by concatenating a certain combination of fields that make the event unique, such as a primary ID, timestamp, event type, and so on. The concatenated value must be a `uri-reference` formatted string, meaning any colon characters must be removed. Afterwards, the concatenated value should be hashed using SHA-256 or another algorithm of your choice.<br><br>It is important to distinguish that **this field does not represent an identity related to an individual person**, but rather the record of data itself. Identity data relating to a person should be relegated to [identity fields](../schema/composition.md#identity) provided by compatible field groups instead. |
| `eventMergeId` | If using the [Adobe Experience Platform Web SDK](../../edge/home.md) to ingest data, this represents the ID of the ingested batch that caused the record to be created. This field is automatically populated by the system upon data ingestion. The use of this field outside of the context of a Web SDK implementation is not supported. |
| `eventType` | A string that indicates the type or category for the event. This field can be used if you want to distinguish different event types within the same schema and dataset, such as distinguishing a product view event from an add-to-shopping-cart event for a retail company.<br><br>Standard values for this property are provided in the [appendix section](#eventType), including descriptions of their intended use case. This field is an extensible enum, meaning that you can also use your own event type strings to categorize the events you are tracking.<br><br>`eventType` limits you to using only a single event per hit on your application, and therefore you must use calculated fields to let the system know which event is most important. For more information, see the section on [best practices for calculated fields](#calculated). |
| `producedBy` | A string value that describes the producer or origin of the event. This field can be used to filter out certain event producers if needed for segmentation purposes.<br><br>Some suggested values for this property are provided in the [appendix section](#producedBy). This field is an extensible enum, meaning that you can also use your own strings to represent different event producers. |
| `identityMap` | A map field that contains a set of namespaced identities for the individual that the event applies to. This field is automatically updated by the system as identity data is ingested. In order to properly utilize this field for [Real-Time Customer Profile](../../profile/home.md), do not attempt to manually update the field's contents in your data operations.<br /><br />See the section on identity maps in the [basics of schema composition](../schema/composition.md#identityMap) for more information on their use case. |
| `timestamp`<br>**(Required)** | An ISO 8601 timestamp of when the event occurred, formatted as per [RFC 3339 Section 5.6](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3339#section-5.6). This timestamp must occur in the past. See the section below on [timestamps](#timestamps) for best practices on the use of this field. |

## Best practices for event modeling

The following sections cover best practices for designing your event-based Experience Data Model (XDM) schemas in Adobe Experience Platform.

### Timestamps {#timestamps}

The root `timestamp` field of an event schema can **only** represent the observation of the event itself, and must occur in the past. If your segmentation use cases require the use of timestamps that may occur in the future, these values must be constrained elsewhere in your Experience Event schema.

For example, if a business in the travel and hospitality industry is modeling a flight reservation event, the class-level `timestamp` field represents the time when the reservation event was observed. Other timestamps that are related to the event, such as the start date of the travel reservation, should be captured in separate fields provided by standard or custom field groups.

![A sample Experience Event schema with Flight Reservation and Start Date highlighted.](../images/classes/experienceevent/timestamps.png)

By keeping the class-level timestamp separate from other related datetime values in your event schemas, you can implement flexible segmentation use cases while preserving a timestamped account of customer journeys in your experience application.

### Using calculated fields {#calculated}

Certain interactions in your experience applications can result in multiple related events that technically share the same event timestamp, and can therefore be represented as a single event record. For example, if a customer views a product on your website, this can result in an event record that has two potential `eventType` values: a "product view" event (`commerce.productViews`) or a generic "page view" event (`web.webpagedetails.pageViews`). In these cases, you can use calculated fields to capture the most important attributes when multiple events are captured in a single hit.

[Adobe Experience Platform Data Prep](../../data-prep/home.md) allows you to map, transform, and validate data to and from XDM. Using the available [mapping functions](../../data-prep/functions.md) provided by the service you can invoke logical operators to prioritize, transform, and/or consolidate data from multi-event records when being ingested into Experience Platform. In the example above, you could designate `eventType` as a calculated field that would prioritize a "product view" over a "page view" whenever they both occur.

If you are manually ingesting data into Platform via the UI, see the guide on [calculated fields](../../data-prep/ui/mapping.md#calculated-fields) for specific steps on how to create calculated fields.

If you are streaming data to Platform using a source connection, you can configure the source to utilize calculated fields instead. Refer to the [documentation for your particular source](../../sources/home.md) for instructions on how to implement calculated fields when configuring the connection.

## Compatible schema field groups {#field-groups}

>[!NOTE]
