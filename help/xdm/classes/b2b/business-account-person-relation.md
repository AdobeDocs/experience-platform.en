| `extSourceSystemAudit` | [[!UICONTROL External Source System Audit Attributes]](../../data-types/external-source-system-audit-attributes.md) | If the account-person relationship comes from an external source system, this object captures audit attributes for that system. |
| `personKey` | [[!UICONTROL B2B Source]](../../data-types/b2b-source.md) | A composite identifier for the person in the account-person relationship. |

However, records relating to these profiles may still persist in the Data Lake. By setting `isDeleted` to `true`, you can use the field to filter out which records have been deleted from your sources when querying the Data Lake. |
