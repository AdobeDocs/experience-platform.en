[!UICONTROL XDM Business Marketing List] is a standard Experience Data Model (XDM) class that captures the minimum required properties of a marketing list. Marketing lists allow you to prioritize on prospect clients who are most likely to buy your product.

![The structure of the XDM Business Marketing List class as it appears in the UI](../../images/classes/b2b/business-marketing-list.png)

| Property | Data type |  Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `extSourceSystemAudit` | [[!UICONTROL External Source System Audit Attributes]](../../data-types/external-source-system-audit-attributes.md) | If the marketing list comes from an external source system, this object captures audit attributes for that system. |
| `marketingListKey` | [[!UICONTROL B2B Source]](../../data-types/b2b-source.md) | A composite identifier for the marketing list entity. |
| `_id` | String  | A unique identifier for the record. This is a system-generated value that is separate from the `marketingListID`. |
| `isDeleted` | Boolean  | Indicates whether this marketing list entity has been deleted in Marketo Engage.<br><br>When using the [Marketo source connector](../../../sources/connectors/adobe-applications/marketo/marketo.md), any records that are deleted in Marketo are automatically reflected in Real-Time Customer Profile. However, records relating to these profiles may still persist in the Data Lake. By setting `isDeleted` to `true`, you can use the field to filter out which records have been deleted from your sources when querying the Data Lake. |
| `marketingListDescription` | String  | A description for the marketing list. |
| `marketingListID` | String  | A unique ID for the marketing list entity. |
| `marketingListName` | String  | The name of the marketing list. |
