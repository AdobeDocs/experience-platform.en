# Schema field group name updates

The names of several Experience Data Model (XDM) schema field groups have changed. Since the field structure of these field groups remains the same, the name changes alone should not affect any existing schemas that employ these field groups. In order to look up and use these field groups in the Adobe Experience Platform user interface, however, their new names must be used.

The following table outlines the existing field groups that have been updated, along with their corresponding new names:
