>[!NOTE]
>
>The names of several schema field groups have changed. See the document on [field group name updates](../name-updates.md) for more information.

[!UICONTROL End User ID Details] is a standard schema field group for the [[!DNL XDM ExperienceEvent] class](../../classes/experienceevent.md), used to describe an individual's identity information across several Adobe applications. The field group provides a root-level `endUserIDs` object, which itself contains a read-only `_experience` field whose values are automatically updated as data is ingested.
