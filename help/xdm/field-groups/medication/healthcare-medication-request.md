# [!UICONTROL Medication Request] schema field group

[!UICONTROL Medication Request] is a standard schema field group for the [[!DNL Medication] class](../../classes/location.md), the [[!DNL XDM Individual Profile] Class](../../classes/individual-profile.md), and the [[!DNL Provider class]](../../classes/provider.md). It provides a single object-type field `healthcareMedicationDispense` which captures an order or request for both supply of the medication and the instructions for administration of the medication to a patient.
