# Audit log endpoint

For each Experience Data Model (XDM) resource, the [!DNL Schema Registry] maintains a log of all changes that have occurred between different updates. The `/auditlog` endpoint in the [!DNL Schema Registry] API allows you to retrieve an audit log for any class, schema field group, data type, or schema specified by ID.

## Getting started

The endpoint used in this guide is part of the [[!DNL Schema Registry] API](https://www.adobe.io/apis/experienceplatform/home/api-reference.html#!acpdr/swagger-specs/schema-registry.yaml). Before continuing, please review the [getting started guide](./getting-started.md) for links to related documentation, a guide to reading the sample API calls in this document, and important information regarding required headers that are needed to successfully make calls to any Experience Platform API.

The `/auditlog` endpoint is part of the remote procedure calls (RPCs) that are supported by the [!DNL Schema Registry]. Unlike other endpoints in the [!DNL Schema Registry] API, RPC endpoints do not require additional headers like `Accept` or `Content-Type`, and do not use a `CONTAINER_ID`. Instead, they must use the `/rpc` namespace, as demonstrated in the API call below.

## Retrieve an audit log for a resource

You can retrieve an audit log for any class, field group, data type, or schema within the Schema Library by specifying the resource's ID in the path of a GET request to the `/auditlog` endpoint.

**API format**

```http
GET /rpc/auditlog/{RESOURCE_ID}
```

| Parameter | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `{RESOURCE_ID}` | The `meta:altId` or URL-encoded `$id` of the resource whose audit log you want to retrieve. |

```

**Response**

A successful response returns a chronological list of changes made to the resource, from most recent to least recent.
