# Create a schema using the [!DNL Schema Registry] API

The [!DNL Schema Registry] is used to access the [!DNL Schema Library] within Adobe Experience Platform. The [!DNL Schema Library] contains resources made available to you by Adobe, [!DNL Experience Platform] partners, and vendors whose applications you use. The registry provides a user interface and RESTful API from which all available library resources are accessible.

This tutorial uses the [!DNL Schema Registry] API to walk you through the steps to compose a schema using a standard class. If you would prefer to use the user interface in [!DNL Experience Platform], the [Schema Editor Tutorial](create-schema-ui.md) provides step-by-step instructions for performing similar actions in the schema editor.

## Getting started

This guide requires a working understanding of the following components of Adobe Experience Platform:

* [[!DNL Experience Data Model (XDM) System]](../home.md): The standardized framework by which [!DNL Experience Platform] organizes customer experience data.
    * [Basics of schema composition](../schema/composition.md): Learn about the basic building blocks of XDM schemas, including key principles and best practices in schema composition.
* [[!DNL Real-Time Customer Profile]](../../profile/home.md): Provides a unified, real-time consumer profile based on aggregated data from multiple sources.
* [[!DNL Sandboxes]](../../sandboxes/home.md): [!DNL Experience Platform] provides virtual sandboxes which partition a single [!DNL Platform] instance into separate virtual environments to help develop and evolve digital experience applications.

Before starting this tutorial, please review the [developer guide](../api/getting-started.md) for important information that you need to know in order to successfully make calls to the [!DNL Schema Registry] API. This includes your `{TENANT_ID}`, the concept of "containers", and the required headers for making requests (with special attention to the Accept header and its possible values).

This tutorial walks through the steps of composing a Loyalty Members schema that describes data related to the members of a retail loyalty program. Before beginning, you may wish to preview the [complete Loyalty Members schema](#complete-schema) in the appendix.

## Compose a schema with a standard class

A schema can be thought of as the blueprint for the data you wish to ingest into [!DNL Experience Platform]. Each schema is composed of a class and zero or more schema field groups. In other words, you do not have to add a field group in order to define a schema, but in most cases at least one field group is used. 

### Assign a class

The schema composition process begins with the selection of a class. The class defines key behavioral aspects of the data (record vs time series), as well as the minimum fields that are required to describe the data that will be ingested.

The schema you are making in this tutorial uses the [!DNL XDM Individual Profile] class. [!DNL XDM Individual Profile] is an standard class provided by Adobe for defining record behavior. More information on behavior can be found in [basics of schema composition](../schema/composition.md).

To assign a class, an API call is made to create (POST) a new schema in the tenant container. This call includes the class the schema will implement. Each schema may only implement one class.

**API format**

```http
POST /tenant/schemas
```

**Request**

The request must include an `allOf` attribute which references the `$id` of a class. This attribute defines the "base class" that the schema will implement. In this example, the base class is the [!DNL XDM Individual Profile] class. The `$id` of the [!DNL XDM Individual Profile] class is used as the value of the `$ref` field in the `allOf` array below.

```SHELL
curl -X POST \
  https://platform.adobe.io/data/foundation/schemaregistry/tenant/schemas \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer {ACCESS_TOKEN}' \
  -H 'x-api-key: {API_KEY}' \
  -H 'x-gw-ims-org-id: {ORG_ID}' \
  -H 'x-sandbox-name: {SANDBOX_NAME}' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
  "type": "object",
  "title": "Loyalty Members",
  "description": "Information for all members of the loyalty program",
  "allOf": [
    {
      "$ref": "https://ns.adobe.com/xdm/context/profile"
    }
  ]
}'
```

**Response**

A successful request returns HTTP Response Status 201 (Created) with a response body that contains the details of the newly created schema, including the `$id`, `meta:altIt`, and `version`. These values are read-only and are assigned by the [!DNL Schema Registry].

```JSON
{
    "type": "object",
    "title": "Loyalty Members",
    "description": "Information for all members of the loyalty program",
    "allOf": [
        {
            "$ref": "https://ns.adobe.com/xdm/context/profile"
        }
    ],

        "https://ns.adobe.com/xdm/data/record",
        "https://ns.adobe.com/xdm/context/identitymap",
        "https://ns.adobe.com/xdm/common/extensible",
        "https://ns.adobe.com/xdm/common/auditable"
    ],

    "meta:xdmType": "object",
    "$id": "https://ns.adobe.com/{TENANT_ID}/schemas/533ca5da28087c44344810891b0f03d9",
    "version": "1.0",
    "meta:resourceType": "schemas",
    "meta:registryMetadata": {
        "repo:createDate": 1551836845496,
        "repo:lastModifiedDate": 1551836845496,
        "xdm:createdClientId": "{CREATED_CLIENT}",
        "xdm:repositoryCreatedBy": "{CREATED_BY}"
    }
}
```

### Look up a schema

To view your newly created schema, perform a lookup (GET) request using the `meta:altId` or the URL encoded `$id` URI for the schema.

**API format**

```http
GET /tenant/schemas/{schema meta:altId or URL encoded $id URI}
```

**Request**

```SHELL
curl -X GET \
  https://platform.adobe.io/data/foundation/schemaregistry/tenant/schemas/https%3A%2F%2Fns.adobe.com%2F{TENANT_ID}%2Fschemas%2F533ca5da28087c44344810891b0f03d9\
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer {ACCESS_TOKEN}' \
  -H 'x-api-key: {API_KEY}' \
  -H 'x-gw-ims-org-id: {ORG_ID}' \
  -H 'x-sandbox-name: {SANDBOX_NAME}' \
  -H 'Accept: application/vnd.adobe.xed+json; version=1'
```

**Response**

The response format depends on the Accept header sent with the request. Try experimenting with different Accept headers to see which one best meets your needs.

```JSON
{
    "type": "object",
    "title": "Loyalty Members",
    "description": "Information for all members of the loyalty program",
    "allOf": [
        {
            "$ref": "https://ns.adobe.com/xdm/context/profile"
        }
    ],
    "meta:class": "https://ns.adobe.com/xdm/context/profile",
    "meta:abstract": false,
    "meta:extensible": false,
    "meta:extends": [
        "https://ns.adobe.com/xdm/context/profile",
        "https://ns.adobe.com/xdm/data/record",
        "https://ns.adobe.com/xdm/context/identitymap",
        "https://ns.adobe.com/xdm/common/extensible",
        "https://ns.adobe.com/xdm/common/auditable"
    ],
    "meta:containerId": "tenant",
    "imsOrg": "{ORG_ID}",
    "meta:altId": "_{TENANT_ID}.schemas.533ca5da28087c44344810891b0f03d9",
    "meta:xdmType": "object",
    "$id": "https://ns.adobe.com/{TENANT_ID}/schemas/533ca5da28087c44344810891b0f03d9",
    "version": "1.0",
    "meta:resourceType": "schemas",
    "meta:registryMetadata": {
        "repo:createDate": 1551836845496,
        "repo:lastModifiedDate": 1551836845496,
        "xdm:createdClientId": "{CREATED_CLIENT}",
        "xdm:repositoryCreatedBy": "{CREATED_BY}"
    }
}
```

### Add a field group {#add-a-field-group}

Now that the Loyalty Members schema has been created and confirmed, field groups can be added to it. 

There are different standard field groups available for use, depending on the class of schema selected. Each field group contains an `intendedToExtend` field that defines the class(es) with which that field group is compatible. 

Field groups define concepts, such as "name" or "address", that can be reused in any schema that needs to capture that same information. 

**API format**

```http
PATCH /tenant/schemas/{schema meta:altId or url encoded $id URI}
```

**Request**

This request updates (PATCH) the Loyalty Members schema to include the fields within the "profile-person-details" field group. 

By adding the "profile-person-details" field group, the Loyalty Members schema now captures information about loyalty program members such as their first name, last name, and birthday.

```SHELL
curl -X PATCH \
  https://platform.adobe.io/data/foundation/schemaregistry/tenant/schemas/_{TENANT_ID}.schemas.533ca5da28087c44344810891b0f03d9 \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer {ACCESS_TOKEN}' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H 'x-api-key: {API_KEY}' \
  -H 'x-gw-ims-org-id: {ORG_ID}' \
  -H 'x-sandbox-name: {SANDBOX_NAME}' \
  -d '[
        { "op": "add", "path": "/allOf/-", "value":  {"$ref": "https://ns.adobe.com/xdm/context/profile-person-details"}}
      ]'
```

**Response**

The response shows the newly added field group in the `meta:extends` array and contains a `$ref` to the field group in the `allOf` attribute.

```JSON
{
    "type": "object",
    "title": "Loyalty Members",
    "description": "Information for all members of the loyalty program",
    "allOf": [
        {
            "$ref": "https://ns.adobe.com/xdm/context/profile"
        },
        {
            "$ref": "https://ns.adobe.com/xdm/context/profile-person-details"
        }
    ],
    "meta:class": "https://ns.adobe.com/xdm/context/profile",
    "meta:abstract": false,
    "meta:extensible": false,
    "meta:extends": [
        "https://ns.adobe.com/xdm/context/profile",
        "https://ns.adobe.com/xdm/data/record",
        "https://ns.adobe.com/xdm/context/identitymap",
        "https://ns.adobe.com/xdm/common/extensible",
        "https://ns.adobe.com/xdm/common/auditable",
        "https://ns.adobe.com/xdm/context/profile-person-details"
    ],
    "meta:containerId": "tenant",
    "imsOrg": "{ORG_ID}",
    "meta:altId": "_{TENANT_ID}.schemas.533ca5da28087c44344810891b0f03d9",
    "meta:xdmType": "object",
    "$id": "https://ns.adobe.com/{TENANT_ID}/schemas/533ca5da28087c44344810891b0f03d9",
    "version": "1.1",
    "meta:resourceType": "schemas",
    "meta:registryMetadata": {
        "repo:createDate": 1551836845496,
        "repo:lastModifiedDate": 1551837227497,
        "xdm:createdClientId": "{CREATED_CLIENT}",
        "xdm:repositoryCreatedBy": "{CREATED_BY}"
    }
}
```

### Add another field group

You can now add another standard field group by repeating the steps using another field group. 

>[!TIP]
>
>It is worthwhile to review all available field groups to familiarize yourself with the fields included in each. You can list (GET) all field groups available for use with a particular class by performing a request against each of the "global" and "tenant" containers, returning only those field groups where the "meta:intendedToExtend" field matches the class you're using. In this case, it is the [!DNL XDM Individual Profile] class, so the [!DNL XDM Individual Profile] `$id` is used: 

```http
GET /global/fieldgroups?property=meta:intendedToExtend==https://ns.adobe.com/xdm/context/profile
GET /tenant/fieldgroups?property=meta:intendedToExtend==https://ns.adobe.com/xdm/context/profile
```

**API format**

```http
PATCH /tenant/schemas/{schema meta:altId or url encoded $id URI}
```

**Request**

This request updates (PATCH) the Loyalty Members schema to include the fields within the "profile-personal-details" field group, adding "home address", "email address", and "home phone" fields to the schema.

```SHELL
curl -X PATCH \
  https://platform.adobe.io/data/foundation/schemaregistry/tenant/schemas/_{TENANT_ID}.schemas.533ca5da28087c44344810891b0f03d9 \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer {ACCESS_TOKEN}' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H 'x-api-key: {API_KEY}' \
  -H 'x-gw-ims-org-id: {ORG_ID}' \
  -H 'x-sandbox-name: {SANDBOX_NAME}' \
  -d '[
        { "op": "add", "path": "/allOf/-", "value":  {"$ref": "https://ns.adobe.com/xdm/context/profile-personal-details"}}
      ]'  
```

**Response**

The response shows the newly added field group in the `meta:extends` array and contains a `$ref` to the field group in the `allOf` attribute.

The Loyalty Members schema should now contain three `$ref` values in the `allOf` array: "profile", "profile-person-details", and "profile-personal-details", as shown below.

```JSON
{
    "type": "object",
    "title": "Loyalty Members",
    "description": "Information for all members of the loyalty program",
    "allOf": [
        {
            "$ref": "https://ns.adobe.com/xdm/context/profile"
        },
        {
            "$ref": "https://ns.adobe.com/xdm/context/profile-person-details"
        },
        {
            "$ref": "https://ns.adobe.com/xdm/context/profile-personal-details"
        }
    ],
    "meta:class": "https://ns.adobe.com/xdm/context/profile",
    "meta:abstract": false,
    "meta:extensible": false,
    "meta:extends": [
        "https://ns.adobe.com/xdm/context/profile",
        "https://ns.adobe.com/xdm/data/record",
        "https://ns.adobe.com/xdm/context/identitymap",
        "https://ns.adobe.com/xdm/common/extensible",
        "https://ns.adobe.com/xdm/common/auditable",
        "https://ns.adobe.com/xdm/context/profile-person-details",
        "https://ns.adobe.com/xdm/context/profile-personal-details"
    ],
    "meta:containerId": "tenant",
    "imsOrg": "{ORG_ID}",
    "meta:altId": "_{TENANT_ID}.schemas.533ca5da28087c44344810891b0f03d9",
    "meta:xdmType": "object",
    "$id": "https://ns.adobe.com/{TENANT_ID}/schemas/533ca5da28087c44344810891b0f03d9",
    "version": "1.2",
    "meta:resourceType": "schemas",
    "meta:registryMetadata": {
        "repo:createDate": 1551836845496,
        "repo:lastModifiedDate": 1551837356241,
        "xdm:createdClientId": "{CREATED_CLIENT}",
        "xdm:repositoryCreatedBy": "{CREATED_BY}"
    }
}
```

### Define a new field group

The Loyalty Members schema needs to capture information that is unique to the loyalty program. This information is not included in any of the standard field groups.  

The [!DNL Schema Registry] accounts for this by allowing you to define your own field groups within the tenant container. These field groups are unique to your organization and are not visible or editable by anyone outside your IMS Org.

In order to create (POST) a new field group, your request must include a `meta:intendedToExtend` field containing the `$id` for the base class(es) with which the field group is compatible, along with the properties that the field group will include.

Any custom properties must be nested under your `TENANT_ID` to avoid collisions with other field groups or fields.

**API format**

```http
POST /tenant/fieldgroups
```

**Request**

This request creates a new field group that has a "loyalty" object containing four loyalty program-specific fields: "loyaltyId", "loyaltyLevel", "loyaltyPoints", and "memberSince".

```SHELL

### Add custom field group to schema

You can now follow the same steps for [adding a standard field group](#add-a-field-group) to add this newly created field group to your schema.

**API format**

```http
PATCH /tenant/schemas/{schema meta:altId or url encoded $id URI}
```

**Request**

This request updates (PATCH) the Loyalty Members schema to include the fields within the new "Loyalty Member Details" field group. 

```SHELL
curl -X PATCH \
  https://platform.adobe.io/data/foundation/schemaregistry/tenant/schemas/_{TENANT_ID}.schemas.533ca5da28087c44344810891b0f03d9 \

      ]'
```

**Response**

You can see that the field group has been successfully added because the response now shows the newly added field group in the `meta:extends` array and contain a `$ref` to the field group in the `allOf` attribute.

```JSON

        "xdm:repositoryCreatedBy": "{CREATED_BY}"
    }
}
```

### View the current schema

You can now perform a GET request to view the current schema and see how the added field groups have contributed to the overall structure of the schema.

**API format**

```http
GET /tenant/schemas/{schema meta:altId or URL encoded $id URI}
```

**Request**

```SHELL
curl -X GET \
  https://platform.adobe.io/data/foundation/schemaregistry/tenant/schemas/_{TENANT_ID}.schemas.533ca5da28087c44344810891b0f03d9 \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer {ACCESS_TOKEN}' \
  -H 'x-api-key: {API_KEY}' \
  -H 'x-gw-ims-org-id: {ORG_ID}' \
  -H 'x-sandbox-name: {SANDBOX_NAME}' \
  -H 'Accept: application/vnd.adobe.xed-full+json; version=1'
```

**Response**

By using the `application/vnd.adobe.xed-full+json; version=1` Accept header, you can see the full schema showing all of the properties. These properties are the fields contributed by the class and field groups that have been used to compose the schema. In this example response, individual property attributes have been minimized for space. You can view the full schema, including all properties and their attributes, in the [appendix](#appendix) at the end of this document.

Under `"properties"`, you can see the `_{TENANT_ID}` namespace that was created when you added the custom field group. Within that namespace is the "loyalty" object and the fields that were defined when the field group was created.

### Create a data type

The Loyalty field group that you created contains specific loyalty properties that might be useful in other schemas. For example, the data might be ingested as part of an experience event or used by a schema that implements a different class. In this case it makes sense to save the object hierarchy as a data type in order to make it easier to reuse the definition elsewhere. 

Data types allow you to define an object hierarchy once, and refer to it in a field much like you would for any other scalar type. 

In other words, data types allow for the consistent use of multi-field structures, with more flexibility than field groups because they can be included anywhere in a schema by adding them as the "type" of a field. 

**API format**

```http
POST /tenant/datatypes
```

**Request**

Defining a data type does not require `meta:extends` or `meta:intendedToExtend` fields, nor do fields need to be nested to avoid collisions.

You can perform a lookup (GET) request using the URL encoded `$id` URI to view the new data type directly. Be sure to include the `version` in your Accept header for a lookup request.

### Use data type in schema

Now that the Loyalty Details data type has been created, you can update (PATCH) the "loyalty" field in the field group you created to reference the data type in place of the fields that were previously there.

**API format**

```http
PATCH /tenant/fieldgroups/{field group meta:altId or URL encoded $id URI}
```

**Request**

```SHELL
curl -X PATCH \

                }
            }
        }
      ]'
```

**Response**

The response now includes a reference (`$ref`) to the data type in the "loyalty" object instead of the fields that were previously defined.

### Define an identity descriptor

Schemas are used for ingesting data into [!DNL Experience Platform]. This data is ultimately used across multiple services to create a single, unified view of an individual. To help with this process, key fields can be marked as "Identity" and, upon data ingestion, the data in those fields is inserted into the "Identity Graph" for that individual. The graph data can then be accessed by [[!DNL Real-Time Customer Profile]](../../profile/home.md) and other [!DNL Experience Platform] services to provide a stitched together view of each individual customer.

Fields that are commonly marked as "Identity" include: email address, phone number, [[!DNL Experience Cloud ID (ECID)]](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/id-service/using/home.html), CRM ID, or other unique ID fields. 

Consider any unique identifiers specific to your organization, as they may be good Identity fields as well.

Identity descriptors signal that the "sourceProperty" of the "sourceSchema" is a unique identifier that should be considered an "Identity". 

For more information on working with descriptors, see the [Schema Registry developer guide](../api/getting-started.md).

**API format**

```http
POST /tenant/descriptors
```

**Request**

The following request defines an identity descriptor on the "loyaltyId" field. This tells [!DNL Experience Platform] to use the unique loyalty program member identifier (in this case, the member's email address) to help stitch together information about the individual.

```SHELL
curl -X POST \
  https://platform.adobe.io/data/foundation/schemaregistry/tenant/descriptors \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer {ACCESS_TOKEN}' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H 'x-api-key: {API_KEY}' \
  -H 'x-gw-ims-org-id: {ORG_ID}' \
  -H 'x-sandbox-name: {SANDBOX_NAME}' \
  -d '{
        "@type": "xdm:descriptorIdentity",
        "xdm:sourceSchema": "https://ns.adobe.com/{TENANT_ID}/schemas/533ca5da28087c44344810891b0f03d9",
        "xdm:sourceVersion": 1,
        "xdm:sourceProperty": "/_{TENANT_ID}/loyalty/loyaltyId",
        "xdm:namespace": "Email",
        "xdm:property": "xdm:code",
        "xdm:isPrimary": false
      }'
```

>[!NOTE]
>
>You can list available "xdm:namespace" values, or create new ones, using the [[!DNL Identity Service API]](https://www.adobe.io/experience-platform-apis/references/identity-service). The value for "xdm:property" can be either "xdm:code" or "xdm:id", depending on the "xdm:namespace" used.

**Response**

A successful response returns HTTP Status 201 (Created) with a response body containing the details of the newly created descriptor, including its `@id`. The `@id` is a read-only field assigned by the [!DNL Schema Registry] and is used for referencing the descriptor in the API.

```JSON
{
    "@type": "xdm:descriptorIdentity",
    "xdm:sourceSchema": "https://ns.adobe.com/{TENANT_ID}/schemas/533ca5da28087c44344810891b0f03d9",

}
```

## Enable schema for use in [!DNL Real-Time Customer Profile] {#profile}

By adding the "union" tag to the `meta:immutableTags` attribute, you can enable the Loyalty Members schema for use by [!DNL Real-Time Customer Profile]. 

For more information on working with union views, see the section on [unions](../api/unions.md) in the [!DNL Schema Registry] developer guide. 

### Add "union" tag

In order for a schema to be included in the merged union view, the "union" tag must be added to the `meta:immutableTags` attribute of the schema. This is done through a PATCH request to update the schema and add the `meta:immutableTags` array with a value of "union".

**API format**

```http
PATCH /tenant/schemas/{meta:altId or the url encoded $id URI}
```

**Request**

```SHELL
curl -X PATCH \
  https://platform.adobe.io/data/foundation/schemaregistry/tenant/schemas/_{TENANT_ID}.schemas.533ca5da28087c44344810891b0f03d9 \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer {ACCESS_TOKEN}' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H 'x-api-key: {API_KEY}' \
  -H 'x-gw-ims-org-id: {ORG_ID}' \
  -H 'x-sandbox-name: {SANDBOX_NAME}' \
  -d '[
        { "op": "add", "path": "/meta:immutableTags", "value": ["union"]}
      ]'
```

**Response**

The response shows that the operation was performed successfully, and the schema now contains a top-level attribute, `meta:immutableTags`, which is an array containing the value, "union".

```JSON
{
    "type": "object",
    "title": "Loyalty Members",

### List schemas in a union

You have now successfully added your schema to the [!DNL XDM Individual Profile] union. In order to see a list of all schemas that are a part of the same union, you can perform a GET request using query parameters to filter the response. 

Using the `property` query parameter, you can specify that only schemas containing a `meta:immutableTags` field that have a `meta:class` equal to the `$id` of the [!DNL XDM Individual Profile] class are returned.

**API Format**

```http
GET /tenant/schemas?property=meta:immutableTags==union&property=meta:class=={CLASS_ID}
```

**Request**

The example request below returns all schemas that are part of the [!DNL XDM Individual Profile] union.

```SHELL
curl -X GET \
  'https://platform.adobe.io/data/foundation/schemaregistry/tenant/schemas?property=meta:immutableTags==union&property=meta:class==https://ns.adobe.com/xdm/context/profile' \
  -H 'Accept: application/vnd.adobe.xed-id+json' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer {ACCESS_TOKEN}' \
  -H 'x-api-key: {API_KEY}' \
  -H 'x-gw-ims-org-id: {ORG_ID}' \
  -H 'x-sandbox-name: {SANDBOX_NAME}'
```

**Response**

The response is a filtered list of schemas, containing only those that satisfy both requirements. Remember that when using multiple query parameters, an AND relationship is assumed. The format of the list response depends on the Accept header sent in the request.

```JSON
{
    "results": [
        {
            "title": "Loyalty Members",
            "$id": "https://ns.adobe.com/{TENANT_ID}/schemas/533ca5da28087c44344810891b0f03d9",

    }
}
```

## Next steps

By following this tutorial, you have successfully composed a schema using both standard field groups and a field group that you defined. You can now use this schema to create a dataset and ingest record data into Adobe Experience Platform.

The full Loyalty Members schema, as created throughout this tutorial, is available in the appendix that follows. As you look at the schema, you can see how the field groups contribute to the overall structure and what fields are available for data ingestion.

Once you have created more than one schema, you can define relationships between them through the use of relationship descriptors. See the tutorial for [defining a relationship between two schemas](relationship-api.md) for more information. For detailed examples of how to perform all operations (GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, and DELETE) in the registry, please refer to the [Schema Registry developer guide](../api/getting-started.md) while working with the API.

## Appendix {#appendix}

The following information supplements the API tutorial.

## Complete Loyalty Members schema {#complete-schema}

Throughout this tutorial, a schema is composed to describe the members of a retail loyalty program. 

The schema implements the [!DNL XDM Individual Profile] class and combines multiple field groups; bringing in information about the loyalty members using the standard "Person Details" and "Personal Details" field groups, as well as through a "Loyalty Details" field group that is defined during the tutorial.

The following shows the completed Loyalty Members schema in JSON format:
