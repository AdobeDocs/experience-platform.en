# Machine Learning assisted schema creation

Use ML algorithms to generate a schema from sample CSV data. This process saves time and increases accuracy when defining the structure, fields, and data types for large complex datasets.

With ML schema generation you can quickly integrate new data sources and reduce the mistakes from manual creation. Non-technical users can use it to  generate schemas or manage large and complex datasets without any extra effort. This speeds up the process from getting data to gaining insights, as makes it easier to combine new data sources and perform data analysis.

## Getting started

This tutorial requires a working understanding of the requirements for schema creation. Before continuing with this guide, you should read the [UI guide to creating and editing schemas](./resources/schemas.md). 

This guide explains how to create schemas using machine learning (ML) algorithms to generate a schema from sample CSV data. See the [manual schema creation workflow guide](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/experience-platform/xdm/ui/resources/schemas#add-field-groups) for information on creating schemas or the document on [field-based workflows in the Schema Editor](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/experience-platform/xdm/ui/field-based-workflows) to enhance your understanding of the schema creation process.

>[!NOTE]
>
>You can also compose a schema using the [!DNL Schema Registry] API. To manually create a schema using the API, first read the [[!DNL Schema Registry] developer guide](../api/getting-started.md) before attempting the tutorial on [creating a schema using the API](create-schema-api.md).

## Navigate to the Create schema workflow {#navigate-to-schema-creation-workflow}

From the left navigation of the Platform UI, select the **[!UICONTROL Schemas]** workspace. The **[!UICONTROL Schemas]** workspace appears. Select **[!UICONTROL Create schema]** to add a new schema to start a schema creation workflow.

![The Schemas workspace with Schema in the left navigation and Create schema highlighted.](../images/ui/ml-schema-creation/schemas-workspace-create-schema.png)

## Create a Schema

The [!UICONTROL Create a schema] dialog appears. Select the **[ML- Assisted]** schema creation option, followed by **[!UICONTROL Select]** to confirm your choice.

### Select a base class

The [!UICONTROL Create schema] workflow appears. Select a base class for your schema followed by **[!UICONTROL Next]**.

![The Schema details workspace with a class and next highlighted.](../images/ui/ml-schema-creation/select-base-class.png)

### Upload a CSV File

The **[!UICONTROL Select data]** stage of the creation workflow appears. From the **[!UICONTROL Upload files]** section, select **[!UICONTROL Choose files]** or the **[!UICONTROL Drag and Drop files]** section. Select a .csv file from your computer to generate a schema.

![The Select data stage of the Create Schema workflow with the Upload files section highlighted.](../images/ui/ml-schema-creation/upload-files.png)

### Preview Data

The [!UICONTROL Uplaod file] section displays the name of the CSV file you have imported and the **[!UICONTROL Preview]** section displays rows of sample data from the file you uploaded. Select **[Next]** to continue the workflow.

![Rows of sample data highlighted in the preview section, and Next highlighted.](../images/ui/ml-schema-creation/preview-data.png)

### Review and Edit Schema

The **[!UICONTROL Review and edit]** stage of the creation workflow now appears, displaying the machine learning-assisted **[!UICONTROL Schema recommendation]** in a tabularized view. This recommended schema is generated by a machine learning model and you can edit, add, or remove fields as needed. The table contains the following fields:

| Field Name       | Description  |
|------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| Data table       | The dataset or database where the field originates. |
| Source Field     | The original field name from the source system.      |
| Target Field     | The field name in the target system where the data will be mapped.   |
| Display Name     | The name used to display the field in the user interface. This should be more user-friendly or descriptive.  |
| Data Type        | The type of data stored in the field (for example, `String`, `Date`). |
| Field Group      | A categorization of the field based on its use or context (for example, Demographic Details, Commerce Details).  |

#### Add a field {#add-field}

To add a field to the schema, select **[Add new field]**. 

![The Review and Edit stage of the schema creation workflow with Add new field highlighted.](../images/ui/ml-schema-creation/add-new-field.png)

The [!UICONTROL Select field] dialog appears. The dialog contains a diagram of the schema as it currently exists. Select the desired field and select **[Select]** to add a new field to the schema. Select **[Cancel]** to close the dialog if needed.
<!-- ... ../images/ui/ml-schema-creation/ -->
![The Select field dialog with a field selected and Select highlighted.](../images/ui/ml-schema-creation/select-field-dialog.png)

A new row appears on your recommended schema. You can now edit the field.

#### Edit a Field {#edit-field}
   
To edit a field, select the pencil icon of the row you wish to edit. A details panel appears to the right where you can edit the custom field mapping. The details panel contains the [!UICONTROL Target field], [!UICONTROL Display Name], [!UICONTROL Data Type], and [!UICONTROL Field Group]. Make any necessary changes and select **[Apply]** to confirm. Select the pencil icon again to close the details panel.

#### Remove a field {#remove-field}

To remove a field, select the minus icon on a row you want to delete. 

>[!CAUTION]
>
>No confirmation dialog appears when removing this item.

![The Review and Edit stage of the schema creation workflow with the minus icon highlighted.](../images/ui/ml-schema-creation/remove-field.png)

#### Approve your recommended schema {#approve}

To approve your recommended schema and continue the **[!UICONTROL Create schema]** workflow, select **[Next]**.

![The Review and Edit stage of the schema creation workflow with Next highlighted.](../images/ui/ml-schema-creation/next.png)

### Name and save schema {#name-and-save}

The **[!UICONTROL Name and save]** stage of the creation workflow appears. Enter a **[Schema display name]** nd optional description. The **[Schema generated]** section provides a diagram of the ML-generated schema. Select **[Finish]** to complete the schema creation workflow.

![The Name and Save Schema stage of the schema creation workflow with Finish highlighted.](../images/ui/ml-schema-creation/name-and-save.png)

### View in the Schema Editor

The Schema Editor appears with your newly created schema displayed in the canvas. Select **[!UICONTROL Save]** to return to the [!UICONTROL Schemas] workspace.

## Next Steps

After creating your schema, you can use the Schema Editor to make further modifications, if necessary. Your new schema is now ready to be integrated with your data sources and used for data analysis.

See the [Edit an existing schema guide](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/experience-platform/xdm/ui/resources/schemas#edit) for more information on using the Schema Editor.
