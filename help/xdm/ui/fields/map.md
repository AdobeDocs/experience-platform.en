# Define map fields in the UI

Adobe Experience Platform allows you to fully customize the structure of your custom Experience Data Model (XDM) classes, schema field groups, and data types. 

You can also define map fields in the Schema Editor to model flexible and dynamic data structures or store a collection of key-value pairs. The map data structure allows for efficient and fast lookups, inserts, and deletes where information is organized and accessed based on unique identifiers.

When defining a new field in the Platform user interface (UI), use the **[!UICONTROL Type]** dropdown and select "**[!UICONTROL Map]**" from the list.

A [!UICONTROL Map value type] property appears. This value is required for [!UICONTROL Map] data types. Available values for the map are [!UICONTROL String] and [!UICONTROL Integer]. Select a value from the drop-down list of available options.

Once you have configured the subfield, you must assign it to a field group. Use the **[!UICONTROL Field Group]** drop down menu, or search field, and select **[!UICONTROL Apply]**. You can continue to add fields to the object using the same process, or select **[!UICONTROL Save]** to confirm your settings.

>[!NOTE]
>
>The Platform UI has limitations in how it can extract the keys of map-type fields. Whereas object-type fields can be expanded, maps are displayed as a single field instead. Map fields created through the Schema Registry API that are not string or integer data types are displayed as "[!UICONTROL Complex]" data types.

## Next steps

After reading this document, you are now able to define map fields in the Platform UI. Remember that you can only use classes and field groups to add fields to schemas. To learn more about how to manage these resources in the UI, see the guides on creating and editing [classes](../resources/classes.md) and [field groups](../resources/field-groups.md).

For more information on the capabilities of the [!UICONTROL Schemas] workspace, see the [[!UICONTROL Schemas] workspace overview](../overview.md).
