# Text classification

>[!NOTE]

>Content and Commerce AI is in beta. The documentation is subject to change.

The text classification service, when given a text fragment, can classify it into one or more labels. The classification can be single-label, multi-label, or hierarchical.

**API format**

```http
POST /services/v1/predict
```

**Request**

The following request classifies text from a fragment based on the input parameters provided in the payload. See the table below the example payload for more information on the input parameters shown.

>[!CAUTION]
>
>`analyzer_id` determines which [!DNL Sensei Content Framework] is used. Please check that you have the proper `analyzer_id` before making your request. Contact the Content and Commerce AI beta team to receive your `analyzer_id` for this service.

```SHELL

| Property | Description | Mandatory |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `analyzer_id` | The [!DNL Sensei] service ID that your request is deployed under. This ID determines which of the [!DNL Sensei Content Frameworks] are used. For custom services, please contact the Content and Commerce AI team to set up a custom ID. | Yes |
| `application-id` | The ID of the application created. | Yes |
| `data` | An array that contains a JSON object with each object in the array representing a document. Any parameters passed as part of this array overrides the global parameters specified outside the `data` array. Any of the remaining properties outlined below in this table can be overridden from within `data`. | Yes |
| `language` | Language of input text. The default value is `en`. | No |
| `content-type` | Used to indicate whether the input is part of the request body or a signed url for an S3 bucket. The default for this property is `inline`. | No |
| `encoding` | The encoding format of input text. This can be `utf-8` or `utf-16`. The default for this property is `utf-8`. | No |
| `threshold` | The threshold of score (0 to 1) above which the results need to be returned. Use the value `0` to return all results. The default for this property is `0`. | No |
| `top-N` | The number of results to be returned (cannot be a negative integer). Use the value `0` to return all results. When used in conjunction with `threshold`, the number of results returned is the lesser of either limit set. The default for this property is `0`. | No |
| `custom` | Any custom parameters to be passed. This property requires a valid JSON object to function. | No |
| `content-id` | The unique ID for the data element thats returned in the response. If this is not passed an auto-generated ID is assigned. | No |
| `content` | The content used by the text classification service. The content can be raw text (‘inline’ content-type). <br> If the content is a file on S3 ('s3-bucket' content-type), pass the signed url. | Yes |

**Response**

A successful response returns the classified text in a response array.
