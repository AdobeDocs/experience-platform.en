# Discover insights with Customer AI

Customer AI, as part of Intelligent Services provides marketers with the power to leverage Adobe Sensei to anticipate what your customers next action is going to be. Customer AI is used to generate custom propensity scores such as churn and conversion for individual profiles at-scale. This is accomplished without having to transform the business needs to a machine learning problem, picking an algorithm, training, or deployment.

This document serves as a guide for interacting with service instance insights in the Intelligent Services Customer AI user interface.

## Getting started

In order to utilize insights for Customer AI, you need to have a service instance with a successful run status available. To create a new service instance visit [Configuring a Customer AI instance](./configure.md). If you recently created a service instance and it is still training and scoring, please allow 24 hours for it to finish running.

## Service instance overview

In the [!DNL Adobe Experience Platform] UI, select **[!UICONTROL Services]** in the left navigation. The *Services* browser appears and displays available Intelligent Services. In the container for Customer AI, select **[!UICONTROL Open]**.

![Accessing your instance](../images/insights/navigate-to-service.png)

The Customer AI service page appears. This page lists service instances of Customer AI and displays information about them, including the name of the instance, propensity type, how often the instance is run, and the status of the last update.

>[!NOTE]
>
>Only service instances that have completed successful scoring runs have insights.

![Create instance](../images/insights/dashboard.png)

Select a service instance name to begin.

![Create instance](../images/insights/click-the-name.png)

Next, the insights page for that service instance appears with the option to select **[!UICONTROL Latest scores]** or **[!UICONTROL Performance summary]**. The default tab **[!UICONTROL Latest scores]** provides visualizations of your data. The visualizations and what you can do with the data are explained in more detail throughout this guide.

 The **[!UICONTROL Performance summary]** tab shows the actual churn or conversion rates for each propensity bucket. To learn more, see the section on [performance summary metrics](#performance-metrics).

![setup page](../images/insights/landing_page_insights.png)

## Service instance details

There are two ways to view service instance details: from the dashboard or within the service instance. 

### Service instance dashboard

To view an overview of the service instance details within the dashboard, select a service instance container, avoiding the hyperlink that is attached to the name. This opens a right rail that provides additional details. The controls contain the following:

- **[!UICONTROL Edit]**: Selecting **[!UICONTROL Edit]** allows you to modify an existing service instance. You can edit the name, description, and scoring frequency of the instance.
- **[!UICONTROL Clone]**: Selecting **[!UICONTROL Clone]** copies the currently selected service instance set up. You can then modify the workflow to make minor tweaks and rename it as a new instance.
- **[!UICONTROL Delete]**: You can delete a service instance, including any historical runs.
- **[!UICONTROL Data source]**: A link to the dataset used by this instance.
- **[!UICONTROL Run Frequency]**: How often a scoring run takes place and when.
- **[!UICONTROL Score definition]**: A quick overview of the goal you configured for this instance.

![](../images/user-guide/service-instance-panel.png)

>[!NOTE]
>
>In the event that a scoring run fails, an error message is provided. The error message is listed under **Last run details** in the right rail which is only visible to failed runs.

![failed run message](../images/insights/failed-run.png)

### Show more insights dropdown

The second way to view additional details for a service instance is located within the insights page. Select **[!UICONTROL Show more]** in the top-right to populate a drop down. Details are listed such as the score definition, when it was created, the propensity type, and the datasets used. For more information on any of the properties listed, please visit [Configuring a Customer AI instance](./configure.md).

![show more](../images/insights/landing-show-more.png)

### Customer AI dataset preview popover

If more than one dataset is used by Customer AI, a hyperlink labeled **[!UICONTROL Multiple ]** followed by the number of datasets in brackets `()` is provided.

![multiple datasets](../images/insights/insights-multi-datasets.png)

Selecting the multiple datasets link opens the Customer AI dataset preview popover. Each color in the preview represents a dataset as shown by the color key to the left of the dataset columns. In this example, you can see that only **Dataset 1** contains the `PROP1` column.

![show more](../images/insights/dataset-preview.png)

### Edit an instance

To edit an instance, select **[!UICONTROL Edit]** in the top-right navigation.

![click the edit button](../images/insights/edit-button.png)

The edit dialog box appears, allowing you to edit the name, description, status, and scoring frequency of the instance. To confirm your changes and close the dialog, select **[!UICONTROL Save]** in the bottom-right corner.

![edit popover](../images/insights/edit-instance.png)

### More actions

The **[!UICONTROL More actions]** button is located in the top-right navigation next to **[!UICONTROL Edit]**. Selecting **[!UICONTROL More actions]** opens a dropdown that allows you to select one of the following operations:

- **[!UICONTROL Clone]**: Selecting **[!UICONTROL Clone]** copies the service instance set up. You can then modify the workflow to make minor tweaks and rename it as a new instance.
- **[!UICONTROL Delete]**: Deletes the instance.
- **[!UICONTROL Access scores]**: Selecting **[!UICONTROL Access scores]** opens a dialog providing a link to the [downloading scores for Customer AI](./download-scores.md) tutorial, the dialog also provides the dataset id required for making API calls.
- **[!UICONTROL View run history]**: A dialog containing a list of all the scoring runs associated with the service instance appears.

![more actions](../images/insights/more-actions.png)

## Scoring summary {#scoring-summary}

Scoring summary displays the total number of profiles scored and categorizes them into buckets containing high, medium, and low propensity. The propensity buckets are determined based on score range, low is less than 24, medium is 25 to 74, and high is above 74. Each bucket has a color corresponding to the legend. 

>[!NOTE]
>
>If it is a conversion propensity score, the high scores show in green and the low scores in red. If you are predicting churn propensity this is flipped, the high scores are in red and the low scores are green. The medium bucket remains yellow regardless of what propensity type you choose.

![scoring summary](../images/insights/scoring-summary.png)

You can hover over any color on the ring to view additional information, such as a percentage and total number of profiles belonging to a bucket.

![](../images/insights/scoring-ring.png)

## Distribution of Scores

The **[!UICONTROL Distribution of Scores]** card gives you a visual summary of the population based on the score. The colors that you see in the [!UICONTROL Distribution of Scores] card represent the type of propensity score generated. Hovering over any of the scoring distributions provides the exact count belonging to that distribution.

![distribution of scores](../images/insights/distribution-of-scores.png)

## Influential factors

For each score bucket, a card is generated that shows the top 10 influential factors for that bucket. The influential factors give you additional details on why your customers belong to various score buckets.

![Influential factors](../images/insights/influential-factors.png)

### Influential factor drilldowns

Hovering over any of the top influential factors further breaks down the data. You are provided an overview as to why certain profiles belong to a propensity bucket. Depending on the factor, you may be given number, categorical, or boolean values. The example below displays categorical values by region.

![drilldown screenshot](../images/insights/drilldown.png)

Additionally, using drilldowns, you are able to compare a distribution factor if it occurs in two or more propensity buckets and create more specific segments with these values. The following example illustrates the first use case:

![](../images/insights/drilldown-compare.png)

You can see that profiles with low propensity to convert are less likely to have made a recent visit to the adobe.com webpages. The "Days since last webVisit" factor has only 8% coverage compared to 26% in medium propensity profiles. Using these numbers, you can compare the distribution within each bucket for the factor. This information can be used to infer that the recency in webvisit is not as influential in the low propensity bucket, as it is in medium propensity bucket.

### Create a segment

Selecting the **[!UICONTROL Create Segment]** button in any of the buckets for low, medium, and high propensity redirects you to the segment builder.

>[!NOTE]
>
>The **[!UICONTROL Create Segment]** button is only available if Real-Time Customer Profile is enabled for the dataset. For more information on how to enable Real-Time Customer Profile, visit the [Real-Time Customer Profile overview](../../../rtcdp/overview.md).

![Click create segment](../images/insights/influential-factors-create-segment.png)

![Create a segment](../images/insights/create-segment.png)

The segment builder is used to define a segment. When selecting **[!UICONTROL Create Segment]** from the Insights page, Customer AI automatically adds the selected buckets information to the segment. To finish creating your segment, simply fill in the **Name** and **Description** containers located in the right rail of the segment builder user interface. After you have given the segment a name and description, select **[!UICONTROL Save]** in the top-right.

>[!NOTE]
>
>Since the propensity scores are written to the individual profile, they are available in the Segment builder like any other profile attributes. When you navigate to the segment builder to create new segments you can see all the various propensity scores under your namespace Customer AI.

![Segment fill in](../images/insights/segment-saving.png)

 To view your new segment in the Platform UI, select **[!UICONTROL Segments]** in the left navigation. The **[!UICONTROL Browse]** page appears and displays all available segments. 

 ![All your Segments](../images/insights/Segments-dashboard.png)

## Historical performance {#historical-performance}

The **[!UICONTROL Performance summary]** tab shows the actual churn or conversion rates, separated into each of the propensity buckets scored by Customer AI.

![Performance summary tab](../images/insights/summary_tab.png)

Initially only expected rates (dotted lines) are displayed. Expected rates are displayed when a scoring run has not occurred and data is not yet available. However, once an outcome window has passed, the expected rate is replaced with an actual rate (solid line).

Hovering over the lines displays the date and actual/expected rate for that day in that bucket.

![Bucket example](../images/insights/churn_tab.png)

You can filter the timeframe for the expected and actual rates being displayed. Select the **calendar icon** ![icon](../images/insights/calendar_icon.png)then select a new date range. The results in each of the buckets are updated to display within the new date range.

![Date selector](../images/insights/date_selector.png)

### Individual scoring run rates

The bottom half of the **[!UICONTROL Performance summary]** tab displays the results for each individual scoring run. Select the dropdown date in the top-right to display results for a different scoring run.

Depending on if you are predicting churn or conversion, the [!UICONTROL Distribution of Scores] graph displays the distribution of profiles churned/converted and not churned/not converted in each increment.

![individual scoring](../images/insights/scoring_tab.png)

## Model evaluation {#model-evaluation}

In addition to tracking the predicted and actual outcomes over time on the Historical Performance tab, marketers have even more transparency over model quality with the Model Evaluation tab. You can use the Lift and Gains charts to determine the differences in using a predictive model vs random targeting. Additionally, you are able to determine how many positive outcomes would be captured at each score cutoff. This is useful for segmentation and for aligning return on investment with marketing actions.

### Lift chart

![lift chart](../images/user-guide/lift-chart.png)

The lift chart measures the improvement of using a predictive model instead of random targeting.

High quality model indicators include:

- High lift values in the first few deciles. This means that the model is good at identifying the users with the highest propensity to take the action of interest.
- Descending lift values. This means that Customers with higher scores are more likely to take the action of interest than people with lower scores.

### Gains chart

![gains chart](../images/user-guide/gains-chart.png)

The cumulative gains chart measures the percentage of positive outcomes captured by targeting scores above a certain threshold. After sorting the customers by propensity score from high to low, the population is split into deciles - 10 equally sized groups. A perfect model would capture all of the positive outcomes in the highest score deciles. A baseline random targeting method captures positive outcomes proportionally to the size of the group - targeting 30% of the users would capture 30% of the outcomes.

High quality model indicators include:

- The cumulative gains approach 100% quickly.
- The cumulative gains curve for the model is closer to the upper left corner of the chart.
- The cumulative gains chart can be used to determine the score cutoffs for segmentation and targeting. For example, if the model captures 70% of the positive outcomes in the first 2 score deciles, targeting users with PercentileScore > 80 is expected to capture approximately 70% of the positive outcomes.

### AUC (Area under the curve)

The AUC reflects the strength of the relationship between the ranking by score and the occurrence of the predicted goal. An **AUC** of 0.5 means the model is no better than a random guess. An **AUC** of 1 means the model can perfectly predict who will take the relevant action.
