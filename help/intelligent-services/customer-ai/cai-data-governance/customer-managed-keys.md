# Customer Managed Keys

Customer AI provides the option for [Healthcare Shield](https://www.adobe.com/trust/compliance/hipaa-ready.html) and Privacy & Security Shield customers to utilize Azure Customer Managed Keys (CMK) to be applied to your Customer AI data. The setup process is the same as [Adobe Experience Platform CMK setup](../../../landing/governance-privacy-security/customer-managed-keys.md) and you can follow the steps outlined in there.

You can read the documentation on [Customer Managed Keys in Adobe Experience Platform](../../../landing/governance-privacy-security/encryption.md) and follow the steps outlined to go through the setup process.

>[!NOTE]
>
>[!DNL Customer Managed Keys] are currently available only for organizations that have purchased the [[!DNL Healthcare Shield or Privacy & Security Shield]](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/blueprints-learn/architecture/vertical-blueprints/healthcare-vertical.html%3Flang%3Den) add-on offering.

All data utilized by Platform is encrypted in transit and at rest to keep your data secure, with or without CMK. For information on Adobe Experience Platform encryption, read the documentation on [Data encryption](../../../landing/governance-privacy-security/encryption.md).
