# Attribution AI and Data Governance

Any data governance-related settings in Attribution AI are inherited from Adobe Experience Platform.

## Data Governance {#governance}

The integration between Attribution AI and Adobe Experience Platform Data Governance gives you the ability to control and comprehend your data throughout its journey through Platform. This involves maintaining data quality, data lineage, data cataloging, and more.

Data usage labels and policies that were created on datasets consumed by Platform can be surfaced in the Attribution AI configuration workflow. These labels stop or warn users who use labeled fields. 

This integration allows you to manage compliance more efficiently. Data stewards in your organization can set policies to restrict usage. As a result, you can use data that complies with policies defined by data stewards. Read the documentation on [Labels and Policies](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/analytics-platform/using/cja-dataviews/data-governance.html) to learn more.
