Customer Managed Keys

Attribution AI provides the option for Healthcare Shield and Privacy & Security Shield customers to utilize an Azure Customer Managed Key (CMK) to be applied to your Attribution AI data. This process is the same as Adobe Experience Platform CMK setup.

NOTE

Customer Managed Keys are currently available only for organizations that have purchased the Healthcare Shield or Privacy & Security Shield add-on offering.



All data utilized by Platform is encrypted in transit and at rest to keep your data secure, with or without CMK. For information on Adobe Experience Platform encryption, learn more.
