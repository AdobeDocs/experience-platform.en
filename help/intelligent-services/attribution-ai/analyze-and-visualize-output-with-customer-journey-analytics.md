# Integrate Attribution AI with Customer Journey Analytics

Along with launching new Attribution AI fields, we are also announcing the capability to integrate Attribution AI with Customer Journey Analytics.

Marketers can now analyze the impact of of every individual customer interaction across each phase of the customer journeys using CJA. With this data, they can measure and optimize marketing and advertising spends. As CJA is built on top of Adobe Experience Platform, you can easily leverage CJA without the need to download the Attribution AI raw scores and then bring in various BI tools.
