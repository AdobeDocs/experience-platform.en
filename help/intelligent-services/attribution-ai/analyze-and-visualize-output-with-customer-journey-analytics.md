Background: Together with launching new fields (above), we are also announcing the capability to integrate Attribution AI with CJA.

The value proposition is marketers can measure and optimize marketing and advertising spend by understanding the impact of every individual customer interaction across each phase of the customer journeys using Customer Journey Analysis (CJA). Because CJA is built on top of Adobe Experience Platform, you can easily leverage CJA without the need to download the Attribution AI raw scores and then bring in various BI tools.

For this part, you can simply add a few words like that and then link to the CJA portion the detailed content. No need to bring the full content here. The below CJA link should work.
