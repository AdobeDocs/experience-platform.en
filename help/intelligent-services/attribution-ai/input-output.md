# Input and output in [!DNL Attribution AI]

The following document outlines the different input and outputs utilized in [!DNL Attribution AI].

## [!DNL Attribution AI] input data

Attribution AI works by analyzing one of the following datasets to calculate algorithmic scores:

- Consumer Experience Event (CEE) dataset
- Adobe Analytics datasets using the [Analytics source connector](../../sources/tutorials/ui/create/adobe-applications/analytics.md)

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>The Adobe Analytics source connector can take up to four weeks to backfill data. If you recently set up a connector, you should verify that the dataset has the minimum length of data required for Attribution AI. Please review the [historical data](#data-requirements) section to verify you have enough data to calculate accurate algorithmic scores.

For more details on setting up the [!DNL Consumer Experience Event] (CEE) schema, please refer to the [Intelligent Services data preparation](../data-preparation.md) guide. For more information on mapping Adobe Analytics data, visit the [Analytics field mappings](../../sources/connectors/adobe-applications/analytics.md) documentation.

Not all the columns in the [!DNL Consumer Experience Event] (CEE) schema are mandatory for Attribution AI. 

>[!NOTE]
>
> The following 9 columns are mandatory, additional columns are optional but recommended/necessary if you want to use the same data for other Adobe solutions such as [!DNL Customer AI] and [!DNL Journey AI].

| Mandatory columns | Needed for |
| --- | --- |
| Primary Identity Field | Touchpoint / Conversion |
| Timestamp | Touchpoint / Conversion |
| Channel._type | Touchpoint |
| Channel.mediaAction | Touchpoint |
| Channel.mediaType | Touchpoint |
| Marketing.trackingCode | Touchpoint |
| Marketing.campaignname | Touchpoint |
| Marketing.campaigngroup | Touchpoint |
| Commerce | Conversion |

Typically, attribution is run on conversion columns such as order, purchases, and checkouts under "commerce". The columns for "channel" and "marketing" are used to define touchpoints for Attribution AI (for example, `channel._type = 'https://ns.adobe.com/xdm/channel-types/email'`). For optimal results and insights, it is highly recommended that you include as many conversion and touchpoint columns as possible. Additionally, you are not limited to just the above columns. You can include any other recommended or custom columns as a conversion or touchpoint definition.

>[!TIP]
>
>If you are using Adobe Analytics data in your CEE schema, the touchpoint information for Analytics is typically stored in `channel.typeAtSource` (for example, `channel.typeAtSource = 'email'`).

The columns below are not required but it is recommended that you include them in your CEE schema if you have the information available.

**Additional recommended columns:**
- web.webReferer
- web.webInteraction
- web.webPageDetails
- xdm:productListItems

## Historical data {#data-requirements}

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
> The minimum amount of data that is needed for Attribution AI to function is as follows:
> - You need to provide at least 3 months (90 days) of data to run a good model.
> - You need at least 1000 conversions.

Attribution AI requires historical data as input for model training. The data duration required is mainly determined by two key factors: training window and look-back window. Input with shorter training windows are more sensitive to recent trends, while longer training windows help produce more stable and accurate models. It's important to model the objective with historical data that best represents your business goals.

The [training window configuration](./user-guide.md#training-window) filters conversion events set to be included for model training based on occurrence time. Currently, the minimum training window is 1 quarter (90 days). The [lookback window](./user-guide.md#lookback-window) provides a time frame indicating how many days prior to the conversion event touchpoints related to this conversion event should be included. These two concepts together determine the amount of input data (measured by days) that is required for an application.

By default, Attribution AI defines the training window as the most recent 2 quarters (6 months) and lookback window as 56 days. In other words, the model will take into consideration all of the defined conversion event(s) that have occurred in the past 2 quarters and look for all the touchpoints that have occurred within 56 days prior to the associated conversion event(s).

**Formula**:

Minimum length of data required = training window + lookback window

>[!TIP]
>
> The minimum length of data required for an application with default configurations is: 2 quarters (180 days) + 56 days = 236 days.

Example : 

- You want to attribute conversion events that have happened within the last 90 days (3 months) and track all the touchpoints that have happened within 4 weeks prior the conversion event. The input data duration should span over the past 90 days + 28 days (4 weeks). The training window is 90 days and the lookback window is 28 days totaling 118 days.

## Attribution AI output data

Attribution AI outputs the following:

- [Raw granular scores](#raw-granular-scores)
- [Aggregated Scores](#aggregated-attribution-scores)

**Example output schema:**

![](./images/input-output/schema_output.gif)

### Raw granular scores {#raw-granular-scores}

Attribution AI outputs attribution scores in the most granular level possible so that you can slice and dice the scores by any score column. To view these scores in the UI, read the section on [viewing raw score paths](#raw-score-path). To download the scores using the API visit the [downloading scores in Attribution AI](./download-scores.md) document.

>[!NOTE]
>
> You are able to see any desired reporting column from the input dataset in the score output dataset only if either of the following are true:
> - The reporting column is included in the configuration page either as part of touchpoint or conversion definition configuration.
> - The reporting column is included in additional score dataset columns.

The following table outlines the schema fields in the raw scores example output:

### Viewing raw score paths (UI) {#raw-score-path}

You can view the path to your raw scores in the UI. Start by selecting **[!UICONTROL Schemas]** in the Platform UI then search for and select your attribution AI scores schema from within the **[!UICONTROL Browse]** tab.

![Pick your schema](./images/input-output/schemas_browse.png)

Next, select a field within the **[!UICONTROL Structure]** window of the UI, the **[!UICONTROL Field properties]** tab opens. Within **[!UICONTROL Field properties]** is the path field that maps to your raw scores.

### Aggregated attribution scores {#aggregated-attribution-scores}

Aggregated scores can be downloaded in CSV format from the Platform UI if the date range is less than 30 days.

Attribution AI supports two categories of attribution scores, algorithmic and rule-based scores.

Attribution AI produces two different types of algorithmic scores, incremental and influenced. An influenced score is the fraction of the conversion that each marketing touchpoint is responsible for. An incremental score is the amount of marginal impact directly caused by the marketing touchpoint. The main difference between the incremental score and the influenced score is that the incremental score takes the baseline effect into account. It does not assume that a conversion is caused purely by the preceding marketing touchpoints.

Here is a quick look at an Attribution AI schema output example from the Adobe Experience Platform UI:

![](./images/input-output/schema_screenshot.png)

See the table below for more details about each of these attribution scores:

| Attribution scores | Description |
| ----- | ----------- |
| Influenced (algorithmic) | Influenced score is the fraction of the conversion that each marketing touchpoint is responsible for. |
| Incremental (algorithmic) | Incremental score is the amount of marginal impact directly caused by a marketing touchpoint.|
| First Touch | Rule-based attribution score that assigns all credits to the initial touchpoint on a conversion path. |
| Last Touch | Rule-based attribution score that assigns all credit to the touchpoint closest to the conversion. |
| Linear | Rule-based attribution score that assigns equal credit to each touchpoint on a conversion path. |
| U-Shaped | Rule-based attribution score that assigns 40% of the credit to the first touchpoint and 40% of the credit to the last touchpoint, with the other touchpoints splitting the remaining 20% equally. |
| Time Decay | Rule-based attribution score where touchpoints closer to the conversion receive more credit than touchpoints that are farther away in time from the conversion. |
