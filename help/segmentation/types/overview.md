# Audience types

Adobe Experience Platform offers a variety of audience types to best let you segment your profiles.

## People audience

A people audience is an audience that is created using **customer** profile data. Customer profile data can be used to create audiences that targets your business' clientele.

For more detailed information about people audiences, please read the [people audience overview](./people-audiences.md).

## Look-alike audience

A look-alike audience is an audience that is created by analyzing a high-value audience with a look-alike machine learning model. The look-alike model can create an audience that matches the similarity threshold of the analyzed high-value audience.
