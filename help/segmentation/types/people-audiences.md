# People audiences guide

In Adobe Experience Platform, people-based audiences allow you to target specific groups of people for your marketing campaigns.

People audiences use customer profile data to target specific markets, letting you better target specific demographics that you want to advertise towards.

## Terminology {#terminology}

Before getting started with people audience, please review the differences between the different audience types:

- **Account audiences**: An account audience is an audience that is created using **account** profile data. Account profile data can be used to create audiences that target people within downstream accounts. For more information about account audiences, please read the [account audience overview](./account-audiences.md).
- **People audiences**: A people audience is an audience that is created using **customer** profile data. Customer profile data can be used to create audiences that targets your business' clientele. 
- **Prospect audiences**: A prospect audience is an audience that is created using **prospect** profile data. Prospect profile data can be used to create audiences from unauthenticated users. For more information about prospect audiences, please read the [prospect audience overview](./prospect-audiences.md).
