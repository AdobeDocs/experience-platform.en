# Audience evaluation methods

Adobe Experience Platform offers a variety of evaluation methods for segmenting your profiles into audiences.

## Batch segmentation

Batch segmentation is a segmentation evaluation method that you can use to move profile data all at once to create your corresponding audiences. You can use batch segmentation to create detailed and rich audiences to target large groups of profiles.

For more information on batch segmentation, please read the [batch segmentation overview](./batch-segmentation.md).

### Flexible audience evaluation

Flexible audience evaluation lets you run a batch segmentation job on demand. You can read the [flexible audience evaluation guide](./flexible-audience-evaluation.md) for more information.

## Streaming segmentation
