# Create audience endpoint

The POST `/audiences` endpoint can be used create the metadata for an external audience, which lets the audience be visible in Audience Portal. You should use this endpoint if the audience ingestion will be managed in a separate service, such as batch ingestion.

## Getting started

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>The endpoints in this guide are prefixed with `/core/ais`, as opposed to `/core/ups`.

In order to use Experience Platform APIs, you must have completed the [authentication tutorial](https://www.adobe.com/go/platform-api-authentication-en). Completing the authentication tutorial provides the values for each of the required headers in Experience Platform API calls, as shown below:

- Authorization: `Bearer {ACCESS_TOKEN}`
- x-api-key: `{API_KEY}`
- x-gw-ims-org-id: `{ORG_ID}`

All resources in [!DNL Experience Platform] are isolated to specific virtual sandboxes. All requests to [!DNL Experience Platform] APIs require a header that specifies the name of the sandbox in which the operation will take place:

- x-sandbox-name: `{SANDBOX_NAME}`
  
>[!NOTE]
>
>For more information on working with sandboxes in [!DNL Experience Platform], see the [sandboxes overview documentation](../../sandboxes/home.md).
