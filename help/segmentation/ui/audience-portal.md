# Audience Portal overview

Audience Portal is a central hub, within Adobe Experience Platform, that allows you to view, manage, and create audiences.

Within Audience Portal, you can accomplish the following tasks:

- [View a list of your audiences](#audience-list)
  - [Use quick actions on your audiences](#quick-actions)
  - [Customize the properties displayed in your list of audiences](#customize)
  - [Use filters, folders, and tags to organize your audiences](#manage-audiences)
- [View details about your audience](#audience-details)
  - [View a summary about your audience](#audience-summary)
- [Enable your audiences for scheduled segmentation](#scheduled-segmentation)
- [Create an audience](#create-audience)
  - [Use Segment Builder to create an audience](#segment-builder)
  - [Use Audience Composition to create an audience](#audience-composition)
  - [Use Federated Audience Composition to create an audience using data from your existing data warehouse](#fac) (Limited availability)
- [Import externally generated audiences](#import-audience)

To open Audience Portal, select the **[!UICONTROL Browse]** tab within the Segmentation section. 

## Audience list {#list}

>[!CONTEXTUALHELP]
>id="platform_segments_browse_churncolumnname"
>title="Churn"

### Audience total {#audience-total}

For Platform-generated audiences and compositions, the **[!UICONTROL Audience total]** section shows the total number of profiles that qualify for the audience.

>[!NOTE]
>
>It may take up to 30 minutes for the audience total count to update after the export job is completed.

Estimates are generated by using a sample size of that day's sample data. If there are less than 1 million entities in your Profile store, the full data set is used; for between 1 and 20 million entities, 1 million entities are used; and for over 20 million entities, 5% of the total entities are used. More information about generating estimates can be found in the [estimate generation section](../tutorials/create-a-segment.md#estimate-and-preview-an-audience) of the audience creation tutorial.

### Ingestion details {#ingestion-details}

For audiences with an origin of **[!UICONTROL Custom upload]**, the **[!UICONTROL Ingestion details]** section shows both the profile total, as well as details of the dataset the externally generated audience was ingested into.

>[!NOTE]
>
>It may take up to 30 minutes following the export job for the profile count of the audience to be fully updated.

![The ingestion details section for the audience details page is displayed.](../images/ui/audience-portal/audience-details-ingestion-details.png)

| Property | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| Profile count | The total number of profiles that qualify for the audience. |
| Dataset name | The name of the dataset that the audience was ingested into. You can select the dataset name for more information about the dataset. To learn more about datasets, read the [dataset UI guide](../../catalog/datasets/user-guide.md). |
| Dataset batch | The ID of the dataset that the audience was ingested into. You can select the ID of the batch for more information about the batch. To learn more about batches, read the [monitoring data ingestion guide](../../ingestion/quality/monitor-data-ingestion.md#viewing-batches). |
| Profile batch | The ID of the batch that created the profiles on Platform. You can select the ID of the batch for more information about the batch. To learn more about batches, read the [monitoring data ingestion guide](../../ingestion/quality/monitor-data-ingestion.md#viewing-batches). |
| Schema | The name of the schema that the audience belongs to. You can select the name of the schema to view information about the schema's structure and apply data usage labels. For more information, read the [manage data usage labels for a schema guide](../../xdm/tutorials/labels.md). |
| Records ingested | The number of records ingested into the dataset. |
| Records failed | The number of records that were not able to be ingested into the dataset. |
| New profile fragments | The number of new profiles that were created. |
| Existing profile fragments | The number of existing profiles that were updated. |

>[!NOTE]
>
>Applying data usage labels to the schema is the best practice. You **cannot** apply a data usage label directly to the audience.

### Activated destinations {#activated-destinations}

The **[!UICONTROL Activated destinations]** section shows the destinations that this audience is activated for.

>[!NOTE]
>
> Destinations are a feature available with [!DNL Adobe Real-Time Customer Data Platform], and allow you to export data to external platforms. For more information on destinations, please read the [destinations overview](../../destinations/home.md). To learn how to activate a segment to a destination, see [activation overview](../../destinations/ui/activation-overview.md).

### Profile samples {#profile-samples}

Underneath is a sampling of profiles that qualify for the segment, detailing information including the [!DNL Profile] ID, first name, last name, and personal email. 

The way data sampling gets triggered depends on the method of ingestion.

For batch ingestion, the Profile store is automatically scanned every fifteen minutes to see if a new batch was successfully ingested since the last sampling job was run. If that is the case, the Profile store is subsequently scanned to see if there's been at least a 5% change in the number of records. If these conditions are met, a new sampling job is triggered.

For streaming ingestion, the Profile store is automatically scanned every hour to see if there's been at least a 5% change in the number of records. If this condition is met, a new sampling job is triggered.

The sample size of the scan depends on the overall number of entities in your Profile store. These sample sizes are represented in the following table:

| Entities in Profile store | Sample size |
| ------------------------- | ----------- |
| Less than 1 million | Full data set |
| 1 to 20 million | 1 million |
| Over 20 million | 5% of total |

More detailed information about each [!DNL Profile] can be seen by selecting the [!DNL Profile] ID. To learn more about a profile's details, please read the [[!DNL Real-Time Customer Profile] user guide](../../profile/ui/user-guide.md#profile-detail).

![The sample profiles for the audience are highlighted. Sample profile information includes the profile ID, the first name, the last name, and the person's email.](../images/ui/audience-portal/audience-details-profiles.png)

## Scheduled segmentation {#scheduled-segmentation}

>[!CONTEXTUALHELP]
>id="platform_segments_browse_addallsegmentstoschedule"
>title="Add all audiences to schedule"
>abstract="Enable to include all audiences evaluated using batch segmentation in the daily scheduled update. Disable to remove all audiences from the scheduled update."

Once audiences have been created, you can then evaluate them through on-demand or scheduled (continuous) evaluation. Evaluation means moving [!DNL Real-Time Customer Profile] data through segment jobs in order to produce corresponding audiences. Once created, the audiences are saved and stored so that they can be exported using [!DNL Experience Platform] APIs. 

On-demand evaluation involves using the API to perform evaluation and build audiences as needed, whereas scheduled evaluation (also known as 'scheduled segmentation') allows you to create a recurring schedule to evaluate audiences at a specific time (at a maximum, once daily).

### Enable scheduled segmentation {#enable-scheduled-segmentation}

Enabling your audiences for scheduled evaluation can be done using the UI or the API. In the UI, return to the **[!UICONTROL Browse]** tab within **[!UICONTROL Audiences]** and toggle on **[!UICONTROL Schedule all audiences]**. This will cause all audiences to be evaluated based on the schedule set by your organization.

>[!NOTE]
>
>Scheduled evaluation can be enabled for sandboxes with a maximum of five (5) merge policies for [!DNL XDM Individual Profile]. If your organization has more than five merge policies for [!DNL XDM Individual Profile] within a single sandbox environment, you will not be able to use scheduled evaluation.

Schedules can currently only be created using the API. For detailed steps on creating, editing, and working with schedules using the API, please follow the tutorial for evaluating and accessing segmentation results, specifically the section on [scheduled evaluation using the API](../tutorials/evaluate-a-segment.md#scheduled-evaluation).

![Sample data for the externally generated audience is displayed.](../images/ui/audience-portal/import-audience-sample-data.png)

The **[!UICONTROL Audience details]** page appears. You can add information about your audience, including its name, description, primary identity, and identity namespace value. 

When importing the externally generated audience, you must select one of the columns to be the primary identity field and specify the namespace value. Please note that all the remaining fields will be considered **payload attributes**. These attributes are considered **non-durable**, as they will only be associated with this audience for purposes of personalization, and are **not** connected to the profile.

You can also optionally add some extra details to your externally generated audience, including giving it an ID, defining its merge policy, or editing its column data type.

>If you use a custom external audience ID, it must adhere to the following guidelines:
>
> - It **must** start with a letter (a-z or A-Z), underscore (_), or a dollar sign ($).
> - All subsequent characters can be alphanumeric (a-z, A-Z, 0-9), underscores (_), or dollar signs ($).

After filling in your audience details, select **[!UICONTROL Next]**.

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>By default, externally generated audiences have a data expiration of 30 days. The data expiration is reset if the audience is updated or modified in any way.
>
>Additionally, if your externally generated audience contains sensitive and/or healthcare-related information, you **must** apply the necessary data usage labels before activating it to any destination. Since variables from externally generated audiences are stored in the data lake rather than within Real-time Customer Profile, you should **not** include consent data within your CSV file. 
>
>For more information on applying data usage labels, please read the documentation on [managing labels](../../access-control/abac/ui/labels.md). To learn about data usage labels on Platform in general, please read the [data usage labels overview](../../data-governance/labels/overview.md). To learn about how consent works in externally generated audiences, please read the [audiences FAQ](../faq.md#consent).
