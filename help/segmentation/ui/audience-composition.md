# Audience Composition UI guide

Audience Composition provides a workspace to build and edit audiences, using blocks that are used to represent different actions.

![The Audience Composition UI.](../images/ui/audience-composition/audience-composition.png)

To change the details of the composition, including the title and description, select the ![sliders](../images/ui/audience-composition/sliders.png) button.

The **[!UICONTROL Composition properties]** popover appears. You can insert details of your composition, including the title and description here. 

![The Composition properties popover is displayed.](../images/ui/audience-composition/composition-properties.png)

>[!NOTE]
>
>If you do **not** give your composition a title, it will have a title of "Composition" followed by the creation date and time by default.

After updating your composition's details, select **[!UICONTROL Save]** to confirm these updates. The audience composition canvas re-appears.

The audience composition canvas is comprised of four different types of blocks: **[[!UICONTROL Audience]](#audience-block)**, **[[!UICONTROL Exclude]](#exclude-block)**, **[[!UICONTROL Rank]](#rank-block)**, and **[[!UICONTROL Split]](#split-block)**.

## [!UICONTROL Audience] {#audience-block}

The **[!UICONTROL Audience]** block type allows you to add the sub-audiences that you want to compose your new larger audience. By default, an **[!UICONTROL Audience]** block is included at the top of the composition canvas.

When you select the **[!UICONTROL Audience]** block, the right rail displays controls for labeling the audience, adding audiences to the block, as well as building custom rules for the audience block.

>[!NOTE]
>
>You can either add audiences **or** create a custom rule. These two functionalities **cannot** be used together.

![The Audience block details are displayed.](../images/ui/audience-composition/audience-block.png)

### [!UICONTROL Add audience] {#add-audience}

To add audiences to the Audience block. select **[!UICONTROL Add Audience]**.

A list of audiences appears. Select the audiences you want to include, followed by **[!UICONTROL Add]** to append them to your audience block.

![A list of audiences appears. You can select which audience you want to add from this dialog.](../images/ui/audience-composition/select-audience.png)

Your selected audiences now appear within the right rail when the **[!UICONTROL Audience]** block is selected. From here, you can change the merge type of the combined audiences.

![The possible merge types for the audiences are highlighted.](../images/ui/audience-composition/merge-types.png)

| Merge type | Description |
| ---------- | ----------- |
| [!UICONTROL Union] | The audiences are combined into one audience. This would be the equivalent of an OR operation. |
| [!UICONTROL Intersection] | The audiences are combined, with only the audiences that are shared in **all** of them being added. This would be the equivalent of an AND operation. |
| [!UICONTROL Exclude overlap] | The audiences are combined, with only the audiences that are shared in **one, but not all** of them being added. This would be the equivalent of a XOR operation. |

### [!UICONTROL Build rule] {#build-rule}

To add a custom rule to the Audience block, select **[!UICONTROL Build rule]**.

![The Build rule button is highlighted.](../images/ui/audience-composition/build-rule.png)
