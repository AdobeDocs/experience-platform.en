# Audience Composition UI guide

>[!NOTE]
>
>This guide explains how to create audiences using Audience Composition. To learn how to create audiences through segment definitions using the Segment Builder please read the [Segment Builder UI guide](./segment-builder.md).

Audience Composition provides a workspace to build and edit audiences, using blocks that are used to represent different actions.

![The Audience Composition UI.](../images/ui/audience-composition/audience-composition.png)

To change the details of the composition, including the title and description, select the ![sliders](/help/images/icons/properties.png) button.

The **[!UICONTROL Composition properties]** popover appears. You can insert details of your composition, including the title and description here. 

![The Composition properties popover is displayed.](../images/ui/audience-composition/composition-properties.png)

>[!NOTE]
>
>If you do **not** give your composition a title, it will have a title of "Composition" followed by the creation date and time by default. Additionally, each composition **must** have its own unique name.

After updating your composition's details, select **[!UICONTROL Save]** to confirm these updates. The audience composition canvas re-appears.

The audience composition canvas is comprised of four different types of blocks: **[[!UICONTROL Audience]](#audience-block)**, **[[!UICONTROL Exclude]](#exclude-block)**, **[[!UICONTROL Rank]](#rank-block)**, and **[[!UICONTROL Split]](#split-block)**.

## [!UICONTROL Audience] {#audience-block}

>[!CONTEXTUALHELP]
>id="platform_segmentation_ao_audience"
>title="Audience block"
>abstract="The Audience block lets you add the sub-audiences that you want to use to compose your new audience."

>[!CONTEXTUALHELP]
>id="platform_segmentation_ao_merge_types"
>title="Merge types"
>abstract="The merge types determine how the selected sub-audiences are combined. Supported values include Union, Intersection, and Exclude overlap."

The **[!UICONTROL Audience]** block type allows you to add the sub-audiences that you want to use to compose your new larger audience. By default, an **[!UICONTROL Audience]** block is included at the top of the composition canvas.

When you select the **[!UICONTROL Audience]** block, the right rail displays controls for labeling the audience, adding audiences to the block, as well as building custom rules for the audience block.

>[!NOTE]
>
>You can either add audiences **or** create a custom rule. These two functionalities **cannot** be used together.

![The Audience block details are displayed.](../images/ui/audience-composition/audience-block.png)

### [!UICONTROL Add audience] {#add-audience}

To add audiences to the Audience block. select **[!UICONTROL Add Audience]**.

![The Add audience button is highlighted.](../images/ui/audience-composition/select-add-audience.png)

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>Please note that **only** audiences defined using the default merge policy will appear. 
>
>Additionally, only **published** audiences created using Segment Builder can be used. Audiences created using Audience Composition and externally generated audiences are **not** available.

A list of audiences appears. Select the audiences you want to include, followed by **[!UICONTROL Add]** to append them to your audience block.

![A list of audiences appears. You can select which audience you want to add from this dialog.](../images/ui/audience-composition/select-audience.png)

Your selected audiences now appear within the right rail when the **[!UICONTROL Audience]** block is selected. From here, you can change the merge type of the combined audiences.

![The possible merge types for the audiences are highlighted.](../images/ui/audience-composition/merge-types.png)

| Merge type | Description |
| ---------- | ----------- |
| [!UICONTROL Union] | The audiences are combined into one audience. This would be the equivalent of an OR operation. |
| [!UICONTROL Intersection] | The audiences are combined, with only the audiences that are shared in **all** of them being added. This would be the equivalent of an AND operation. |
| [!UICONTROL Exclude overlap] | The audiences are combined, with only the audiences that are shared in **one, but not all** of them being added. This would be the equivalent of a XOR operation. |

### [!UICONTROL Build rule] {#build-rule}

>[!CONTEXTUALHELP]
>id="platform_segmentation_ao_rule_builder"
>title="Segment Builder"
>abstract="You can use Segment Builder to add a custom rule for your composition."

To add a custom rule to the Audience block, select **[!UICONTROL Build rule]**.

![The Build rule button is highlighted.](../images/ui/audience-composition/select-build-rule.png)

The Segment Builder appears. You can use the Segment Builder to create a custom rule for the audience to follow. More information about using the Segment Builder can be found in the [Segment Builder guide](./segment-builder.md).

![The Segment Builder UI is displayed.](../images/ui/audience-composition/segment-builder.png)

After adding a custom rule, select **[!UICONTROL Save]** to add the rule to your audience.

>[!CONTEXTUALHELP]
>id="platform_segmentation_ao_exclude_type"
>title="Exclude type"
>abstract="You can either exclude profiles belonging to a specific audience (Exclude by audience) or exclude profiles based on a specific attribute (Exclude by attribute)."

The **[!UICONTROL Exclude]** block type allows you to exclude a specified sub-audience or attributes from your new larger audience.

To add an **[!UICONTROL Exclude]** block, select the **+** icon, followed by **[!UICONTROL Exclude]**.

![The Exclude option is selected.](../images/ui/audience-composition/add-exclude-block.png)

The **[!UICONTROL Exclude]** block is added. When this block is selected, details about the exclusion appear in the right rail. This includes the block's label and exclusion type. You can exclude [by audience](#exclude-audience) or [by attribute](#exclude-attribute).

>[!CONTEXTUALHELP]
>id="platform_segmentation_ao_exclude_attribute"
>title="Exclude by attribute"
>abstract="When you exclude by attribute, you can exclude specific profiles from appearing in your composition based on the attributes selected."

If you exclude by attribute, you can select which attributes you want to exclude by selecting the ![filter](/help/images/icons/project-edit.png) icon within the **[!UICONTROL Exclusion rule]** section. Excluding the attribute lets you exclude any profile that contains this attribute from your resulting audience.

![The attribute section is highlighted, showing you where to select to choose the attribute to exclude.](../images/ui/audience-composition/exclude-attribute.png)

A list of profile attributes appears. Select the attribute type you want to exclude, followed by **[!UICONTROL Select]** to add them to your exclude block.

![A list of attributes is shown.](../images/ui/audience-composition/select-attribute-exclude.png)

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>When excluding by attribute, you can only specify **one** value to exclude. Using any sort of separator, like a comma or semicolon, will only result in excluding that exact value. For example, setting the value as `red, blue` will result in excluding the term `red, blue` from the attribute, but will **not** result in excluding either the term `red` or `blue`.

>abstract="The Other profiles toggle lets you create an additional path with the remaining profiles that do not match any of the other paths' specified conditions."

The **[!UICONTROL Split]** block type allows you to split your new audience into various sub-audiences. You can either split this audience based on percentage or by an attribute. When splitting your audience into sub-audiences, this split is **not** persistent. This means that the profiles may be in different sub-audiences for each evaluation.

To add a **[!UICONTROL Split]** block, select the **+** icon, followed by **[!UICONTROL Split]**.

When splitting by percentage, the audiences will be randomly split, based on the number of paths and percentages provided.

![The percent split is highlighted.](../images/ui/audience-composition/split-by-percentage.png)

Alternatively, you can also provide an identity, which would make the percentage-based split persistent. Available identity types include all the identity namespace available on your organization.
