# Using [!DNL Adobe Target] with the [!DNL Platform Web SDK]

[!DNL Adobe Experience Platform] [!DNL Web SDK] can deliver and render personalized experiences managed in [!DNL Adobe Target] to the web channel. You can use a WYSIWYG editor, called the [Visual Experience Composer](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/target/using/experiences/vec/visual-experience-composer.html) (VEC), or a non-visual interface, the [Form-based Experience Composer](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/target/using/experiences/form-experience-composer.html), to create, activate, and deliver your activities and personalization experiences.

The following features have been tested and are currently supported in [!DNL Target]:

* [A/B Tests](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/target/using/activities/abtest/test-ab.html)
* [A4T Impression and conversion reporting](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/target/using/integrate/a4t/a4t.html)
* [Automated Personalization activities](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/target/using/activities/automated-personalization/automated-personalization.html)
* [Experience Targeting activities](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/target/using/activities/automated-personalization/automated-personalization.html)
* [Multivariate Tests (MVT)](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/target/using/activities/multivariate-test/multivariate-testing.html)
* [Recommendations activities](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/target/using/recommendations/recommendations.html)
* [Native Target impression and conversion reporting](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/target/using/reports/reports.html)
* [VEC Support](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/target/using/experiences/vec/visual-experience-composer.html)

## Enabling [!DNL Adobe Target]

To enable [!DNL Target], do the following:

1. Enable [!DNL Target] in your [datastream](../../fundamentals/datastreams.md) with the appropriate client code.
1. Add the `renderDecisions` option to your events.

Then, optionally, you can also add the following options:

* **`decisionScopes`**: Retrieve specific activities (useful for activities created with the form-based composer) by adding this option to your events.
* **[Prehiding snippet](../manage-flicker.md)**: Hide only certain portions of the page.

## Using the Adobe Target VEC

To use the VEC with a [!DNL Platform Web SDK] implementation, install and activate either the [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/adobe-target-vec-helper/) or [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/adobe-target-vec-helper/ggjpideecfnbipkacplkhhaflkdjagak) VEC Helper Extension.

For more information, see [Visual Experience Composer helper extension](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/target/using/experiences/vec/troubleshoot-composer/vec-helper-browser-extension.html) in the *Adobe Target guide*.

## Auto-render VEC Activities

The [!DNL Adobe Experience Platform Web SDK] has the power to automatically render your experiences defined via [!DNL Adobe Target]’s VEC on the web for your users. In order to indicate to [!DNL Experience Platform Web SDK] to auto-render VEC activities, send an event with `renderDecisions = true`:

```javascript
alloy
("sendEvent", 
  { 
  "renderDecisions": true, 
  "xdm": {
    "commerce": { 
      "order": {
        "purchaseID": "a8g784hjq1mnp3", 
         "purchaseOrderNumber": "VAU3123", 
         "currencyCode": "USD", 
         "priceTotal": 999.98 
         } 
      } 
    }
  }
);
```

## Using the Form-Based Composer

The [Form-Based Experience Composer](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/target/using/experiences/form-experience-composer.html) is a non-visual interface that’s useful for configuring [!UICONTROL A/B Tests], [!UICONTROL Experience Targeting], [!UICONTROL Automated Personalization], and [!UICONTROL Recommendations] activities with different response types, such as JSON, HTML, Image, etc. Depending on the response type or decision returned by [!DNL Target], your core business logic can be executed. To retrieve decisions for your Form-Based Composer activities, send an event with all ‘decisionScopes’ you want to retrieve a decision for.

```javascript
alloy
  ("sendEvent", { 
    decisionScopes: [
      "foo", "bar"], 
      "xdm": {
        "commerce": { 
          "order": { 
            "purchaseID": "a8g784hjq1mnp3", 
            "purchaseOrderNumber": "VAU3123", 
            "currencyCode": "USD", 
            "priceTotal": 999.98 
          } 
        } 
      } 
    }
  );
```

## Decision Scopes

`decisionScopes` define sections, locations, or parts of your pages where you want to render a personalized experience. These `decisionScopes` are customizable and user-defined. For current [!DNL Target] customers, `decisionScopes` are also known as "mboxes." In the [!DNL Target] UI, `decisionScopes` appear as "locations."

## The `__view__` Scope

The [!DNL Experience Platform Web SDK] provides functionality to retrieve VEC actions without relying on the SDK to render the VEC actions for you. Send an event with `__view__` defined as a `decisionScopes`.

```javascript
alloy("sendEvent", {
      "decisionScopes": ["__view__", "foo", "bar"], 
      "xdm": { 
        "web": { 
          "webPageDetails": { 
            "name": "Home Page"
          }
        } 
      }
    }
  ).then(function(results) {
    for (decision of results.decisions) {
      if (decision.decisionScope === "__view__") {
        console.log(decision.content)
      }
    }
  });
```   

## Audiences in XDM

When defining audiences for your [!DNL Target] activities that are delivered via the [!DNL Platform Web SDK], [XDM](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-platform/xdm/home.html) must be defined and used. After you define XDM schemas, classes, and schema field groups, you can create a [!DNL Target] audience rule defined by XDM data for targeting. Within [!DNL Target], XDM data displays in the [!UICONTROL Audience Builder] as a custom parameter. The XDM is serialized using dot notation (for example, `web.webPageDetails.name`).

If you have [!DNL Target] activities with predefined audiences that use custom parameters or a user profile, they are not delivered correctly via the SDK. Instead of using custom parameters or the user profile, you must use XDM instead. However, there are out-of-the-box audience targeting fields supported via the [!DNL Platform Web SDK] that do not require XDM. These fields are available in the [!DNL Target] UI that do not require XDM: 

* Target Library
* Geo
* Network
* Operating System
* Site Pages
* Browser
* Traffic Sources
* Time Frame

For more information, see [Categories for audiences](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/target/using/audiences/create-audiences/categories-audiences/target-rules.html?lang=en) in the *Adobe Target guide*.

### Single profile update

The [!DNL Platform Web SDK] lets you update the profile to the [!DNL Target] profile and to the [!DNL Platform Web SDK] as an experience event.

To update a [!DNL Target] profile, ensure that the profile data is passed with the following:

* Under `“data {“`
* Under `“__adobe.target”`
* Prefix `“profile.”` e.g. as below

|Key|Type|Description|
| --- | --- | --- |
|`renderDecisions`|Boolean|Instructs the personalization component whether it should interpret DOM actions|
|`decisionScopes`|Array `<String>`|A list of scopes to retrieve decisions for|
|`xdm`|Object|Data formatted in XDM that land in the Platform Web SDK as an experience event|
|`data`|Object|Arbitrary key/value pairs sent to [!DNL Target] solutions under the target class.|

Typical [!DNL Platform Web SDK] code using this command looks like the following:

**`sendEvent` with profile data**

```
alloy("sendEvent", {
   renderDecisions: true|false,
   xdm: { // Experience Event XDM data },
   data: { // Freeform stuff (event & profile) }
});
```

**Sample code**

```
alloy("sendEvent", {
  renderDecisions: true,
  xdm: {
    device: {
      screenWidth: 9999
    }
  },
  data: {
    __adobe: {
      target: {
        "profile.gender": "female",
        "profile.age": 30,
	"entity.id" : "123",
	"entity.genre" : "Drama"
      }
    }
  }
}) 
.then(console.log);
```

## Debugging

mboxTrace and mboxDebug have been deprecated. Use [[!DNL Platform Web SDK] debugging](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-platform/edge/fundamentals/debugging.html).

## Terminology

__Decisions:__ In [!DNL Target], decisions correlate to the experience that is selected from an Activity.

__Schema:__ The schema of a decision is the type of offer in [!DNL Target]. 

__Scope:__ The scope of the decision. In [!DNL Target], the scope is the mBox. The global mBox is the `__view__` scope.

__XDM:__ The XDM is serialized into dot notation and then put into [!DNL Target] as mBox parameters.
