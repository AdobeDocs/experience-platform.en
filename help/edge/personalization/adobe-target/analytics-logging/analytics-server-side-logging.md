## Overview

Adobe Experience Platform Web SDK improves the A4T functionality, since there is no hit stitching and Analytics hit is augmented with Target details in Konductor, without having to go through the hit stitching process. 
`Analytics Logging Server Side` is enabled when Analytics is enabled in the datastream configuration.
