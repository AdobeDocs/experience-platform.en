# Analytics Logging
When using Adobe Target for personalization, customers can choose which system they would like to use for performance measurement. A Target activity allows customer to select between Target reporting and Analytics reporting. 
If customer uses Analytics reporting, Adobe Target has to communicate to Analytics:
- which Adobe Target activity their users have entered
- which experience they have seen
- which conversion has been reached

Adobe Experience Platform Web SDK supports two types of Analytics logging used for A4T:
- [Server Side Analytics Logging]()
- [Client Side Analytics Logging]()
