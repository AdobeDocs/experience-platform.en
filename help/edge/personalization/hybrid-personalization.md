# Hybrid personalization using Web SDK and Edge Network Server API

## Overview {#overview}

Hybdrid personalization describes the process of retrieving personalization content server-side, using the [Edge Network Server API](../..//server-api/overview.md), and rendering it client-side, using the [Web SDK](../home.md).

You can use hybrid personalization with personalization solutions like Adobe Target or Offer Decisioning, the difference being the contents of the [!UICONTROL Server API] payload.

## Prerequisites {#prerequisites}

Before implementing hybrid personalization on your web properties, make sure you meet the following conditions:

* You have decided what personalization solution you want to use. This will have an impact on the contents of the [!UICONTROL Server API] payload.
* You have access to an application server which you can use to make the [!UICONTROL Server API] calls.
* You have access to the [Edge Network Server API](../../server-api/authentication.md).
* You have correctly [configured and deployed](../fundamentals/configuring-the-sdk.md) Web SDK on the pages that you want to personalize.

## Flow diagram {#flow-diagram}

The flow diagram below describes the order of the steps taken to deliver hybrid personalization.

1. Any existing cookies previously stored by the browser, prefixed with `kndctr_`, are included in the browser request.
1. The client web browser requests the web page from your application server. 
1. When the application server receives the page request, it makes a `POST` request to the [Server API interactive data collection endpoint](../../server-api/interactive-data-collection.md) to fetch personalization content. The `POST` request contains an `event` and a `query`. The cookies from the previous step, if available, are included in the `meta>state>entries` array.
1. The Server API returns the personalization content to your application server.
1. The application server returns an HTML response to the client browser, containing the [identity and cluster cookies](#cookies).
1. On the client page, the [!DNL Web SDK] `applyResponse` command is called, passing in the headers and body of the [!UICONTROL Server API] response from the previous step.
1. The [!DNL Web SDK] renders page load [[!DNL Visual Experience Composer (VEC)]](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/target/using/experiences/vec/visual-experience-composer.html?lang=en) offers automatically, because the `renderDecisions` flag is set to `true`.
1. Form-based [!DNL JSON] offers are manually applied through the `applyPersonalization` method, to update the [!DNL DOM] based on the personalization offer.
1. For form-based activities, display events must manually be sent, to indicate when the offer has been displayed. This is done via the `sendEvent` command.

## Cookies {#cookies}

Cookies are used to persist user identity and cluster information.  When using a hybrid implementation, the Web application server handles the storing and sending of these cookies during the request lifecycle.

| Cookie | Purpose | Stored by | Sent by |
|---|---|---|---|
| `kndctr_AdobeOrg_identity` | Contains user identity details. | Application server | Application server |
| `kndctr_AdobeOrg_cluster`  | Indicates which Edge Network cluster should be used to fulfill the requests. | Application server | Application server |

## Request placement {#request-placement}

Server API requests are required to get propositions and send a display notification. When using a hybrid implementation, the application server makes these requests to the Server API.

| Request | Made by | 
|---|---|
| Interact request to retrieve propositions | Application server |
| Interact request to send display notifications | Application server |

## Analytics implications {#analytics}

When implementing hybrid personalization, you must pay special attention so that page hits are not counted multiple times in Analytics.

When you [configure a datastream](../../datastreams/overview.md) for Analytics, events are automatically forwarded so that page hits are captured. 

The sample from this implementation uses two different datastreams:

* A datastream configured for Analytics. This datastream is used for Web SDK interactions.
* A second datastream without an Analytics configuration. This datastream is used for Server API requests.

This way, the server-side request do not register any Analytics events, but the client-side requests do. This leads to Analytics requests being accurately counted.


## Server-side request {#server-side-request}

The sample request below illustrates a Server API request that your application server could use to retrieve the personalization content.

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>This sample request uses Adobe Target as a personalization solution. Your request might vary according to your chosen personalization solution.

### Server-side response {#server-response}

The sample response below shows what the Server API response might look like.


```json
{
   "requestId":"5c539bd0-33bf-43b6-a054-2924ac58038b",
   "handle":[
      {
         "payload":[
            {
               "id":"XXX",
               "namespace":{
                  "code":"ECID"
               }
            }
         ],
         "type":"identity:result"
      },
      {
         "payload":[
            {
               "..."
            },
            {
               "..."
            }
         ],
         "type":"personalization:decisions",
         "eventIndex":0
      }
   ]
}
```

## Client-side request {#client-request}

On the client page, the [!DNL Web SDK] `applyResponse` command is called, passing in the headers and body of the server-side response.

```js
   alloy("applyResponse", {
      "renderDecisions": true,
      "responseHeaders": {
         "cache-control": "no-cache, no-store, max-age=0, no-transform, private",
         "connection": "close",
         "content-encoding": "deflate",
         "content-type": "application/json;charset=utf-8",
         "date": "Mon, 11 Jul 2022 19:42:01 GMT",
         "server": "jag",
         "strict-transport-security": "max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains",
         "transfer-encoding": "chunked",
         "vary": "Origin",
         "x-adobe-edge": "OR2;9",
         "x-content-type-options": "nosniff",
         "x-konductor": "22.6.78-BLACKOUTSERVERDOMAINS:7fa23f82",
         "x-rate-limit-remaining": "599",
         "x-request-id": "5c539bd0-33bf-43b6-a054-2924ac58038b",
         "x-xss-protection": "1; mode=block"
      },
      "responseBody": {
         "requestId": "5c539bd0-33bf-43b6-a054-2924ac58038b",
         "handle": [
         {
            "payload": [
               {
               "id": "XXX",
               "namespace": {
                  "code": "ECID"
               }
               }
            ],
            "type": "identity:result"
         },
         {
            "payload": [
               {...}, 
               {...}
            ],
            "type": "personalization:decisions",
            "eventIndex": 0
         }
         ]
      }
   }
   ).then(applyPersonalization("sample-json-offer"));
```

Form-based [!DNL JSON] offers are manually applied through the `applyPersonalization` method, to update the [!DNL DOM] based on the personalization offer. For form-based activities, display events must manually be sent, to indicate when the offer has been displayed. This is done via the `sendEvent` command.

```js
function sendDisplayEvent(decision) {
    const { id, scope, scopeDetails = {} } = decision;

    alloy("sendEvent", {
        xdm: {
            eventType: "decisioning.propositionDisplay",
            _experience: {
                decisioning: {
                    propositions: [
                        {
                            id: id,
                            scope: scope,
                            scopeDetails: scopeDetails,
                        },
                    ],
                },
            },
        },
    });
}
```

## Sample application {#sample-app}

To help you experiment and learn more about this type of personalization, we provide a sample application which you can download and use for testing. You can download the application, along with detailed instructions on how to use it, from this [GitHub repository](https://github.com/adobe/alloy-samples).
