# (Beta) Supporting in-app browsers

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>Adobe Experience Platform [!DNL Web SDK] is currently in beta and is not available to all users. The documentation and the functionality are subject to change.

Within browsers embedded inside mobile applications, the SDK behaves exactly as it would within a regular browser; however, you should make sure the Visitor ID gets passed from the mobile application into the website through the URL. This process is outlined in the documentation for the [Experience SDK for Mobile](https://docs.adobe.com/content/help/en/mobile-services/ios/sdk-reference-ios/hybrid-app.html).
