# Adobe Experience Platform Web SDK extension

>[!NOTE]
>
>Adobe Experience Platform Launch has been rebranded as a suite of data collection technologies in Adobe Experience Platform. Several terminology changes have rolled out across the product documentation as a result. Please refer to the following [document](../tags/term-updates.md) for a consolidated reference of the terminology changes.

The Adobe Experience Platform Web SDK extension sends data to the Adobe Experience Cloud from web properties, through the Adobe Experience Platform Edge Network. The Platform Web SDK extension allows for streaming data into platform, syncing identities, opt-in and automatically collecting context data. 

For details about configuring the Web SDK extension, see the [Configure the Web SDK tag extension](../tags/extensions/client/web-sdk/web-sdk-extension-configuration.md).
