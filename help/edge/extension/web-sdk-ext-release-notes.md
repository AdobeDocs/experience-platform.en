* Added support for an `out` option when [configuring default consent](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-platform/edge/fundamentals/configuring-the-sdk.html#default-consent) which drops all events until consent is received (the existing `pending` option queues events and sends them once consent is received).

## Version 2.2.0 - October 1, 2020

* When customers tried to create an XDM object from sandbox schemas, they were running into authentication issues. The API that calls Platform is now aware of environments so users are only presented with those schemas that they have access to edit.
* When using the `identityMap` data element, the namespaces is now pre-populated in a dropdown so you don't have to fill this in manually.
* Revamped the UI for the `xdmObject` data element. In the new UI, you can see which fields have been populated without having to enter each item in the object.

## Version 2.1.1 - August 26, 2020

* Fixes an issue where Adobe Experience Platform sandboxes on the XDM Object view displayed incorrectly. If, when using this version of the extension, an expected sandbox is not displayed in the list, the user should check with their Adobe Experience Platform administrator to ensure access permissions are set correctly.

## Version 2.1.0 - August 5, 2020

* Breaking Change: Remove the `syncIdentity` action and support passing those IDs in the `sendEvent` action instead. Please disable any existing rule using this action before upgrading your extension.
* Update to Alloy v. 2.1.0 ([Release Notes](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-platform/edge/release-notes.html))
* Support IAB 2.0 Consent Standard in the `setConsent` action.
* Support overriding the dataset ID in the `sendEvent` action.
* Add a new Data Element of type `IdentityMap` which can be used to populate the `identityMap` entry in the XDM Object Data Element which is now enabled, and in the `setConsent` action.
* Support passing an identity map in the `setConsent` action.
* Support choosing an Platform sandbox in the XDM Object Data Element.

## Version 1.0.0 - May 26, 2020

## Version 0.1.2 - May 4, 2020

* Renamed `configId` to `edgeConfigId`.
* Renamed `viewStart` to `renderDecisions`, set to false by default. If set to true, Personalization offers are fetched and auto-rendered.
* Changes related to `Get Decisions`:
  * Removed the `getDecisions` command.
  * Added a `scopes` option to the `sendEvent` command. Decisions are returned in the `sendEvent` resolved promise.
  * Added a built-in `__view__` scope which will result in returning page/view wide offers. (VEC offers in Target for example.)
Those decisions return from the `sendEvent` command only if `renderDecisions` is set to false.
  * Added a `Decisions Received` event, which fires when decisions become available.
* Combined multiple Personalization notifications under a single server call.
* Fixed issue in Event Merge ID where it was being reset every time the data element was referenced.
* Renamed the `setCustomerIds` action to `syncIdentity`.

* Removed idSyncContainerId, datasetId, schemaId, urlDestinationsEnabled, and cookieDestinationsEnabled options
* Added support for hyphens in edgeDomain option value
* Request made during ID migration is sent to demdex endpoint to improve cross-domain identification when demdex cookie is not set
* Request made during ID migration always expects a response to ensure identity cookie gets set
* When executing an invalid command, a list of valid command names will be logged in the console
* Added checkbox for toggling third-party cookie support to the tag extension. This disables calls to demdex.net

## Version 0.0.5 - December 20, 2019

* Add Activity Tracker configs to tag extension
* Expose EventType and EventMergeId on event command
* Add onBeforeEventSend config to tag extension
* Add edgeBasePath config to tag extension

## Version 0.0.3 - November 25, 2019
