# Configure a datastream

This document covers the steps for configuring a [datastream](./overview.md) in the UI. 

## Access the [!UICONTROL Datastreams] workspace

You can create and manage datastreams in the Data Collection UI or Experience Platform UI by selecting **[!UICONTROL Datastreams]** in the left navigation.

![Datastreams tab in the Data Collection UI](../assets/datastreams/configure/datastreams-tab.png)

The **[!UICONTROL Datastreams]** tab displays a list of existing datastreams, including their friendly name, ID, and last modified date. Select the name of a datastream to [view its details and configure services](#view-details).

Select the "more" icon (**...**) for a particular datastream to reveal more options. Select **[!UICONTROL Edit]** to update the [basic configuration](#configure) for the datastream, or select **[!UICONTROL Delete]** to remove the datastream.

![Options to edit or delete an existing datastream](../assets/datastreams/configure/edit-datastream.png)

## Create a new datastream {#create}

To create a datastream, start by selecting **[!UICONTROL New Datastream]**.

![Select New Datastream](../assets/datastreams/configure/new-datastream-button.png)

The datastream creation workflow appears, starting at the configuration step. From here, you must provide a name and optional description for the datastream.

If you are configuring this datastream for use in Experience Platform and are using the Platform Web SDK, you must also select an [event-based Experience Data Model (XDM) schema](../../xdm/classes/experienceevent.md) to represent the data you plan on ingesting.

![Basic configuration for a datastream](../assets/datastreams/configure/configure.png)

Select **[!UICONTROL Advanced Options]** to reveal additional controls to configure the datastream.

![Advanced configuration options](../assets/datastreams/configure/advanced-options.png) {#advanced-options}

| Setting | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [!UICONTROL Geo Location] | Determines whether geolocation lookups occur based on the user's IP address. The default setting **[!UICONTROL None]** disables any geolocation lookups, while the **[!UICONTROL City]** setting provides GPS coordinates to two decimal places. Geolocation occurs before [!UICONTROL IP Obfuscation] and is not impacted by the  [!UICONTROL IP Obfuscation] setting.|
| [!UICONTROL IP Obfuscation]| Indicates the type of IP obfuscation to be applied to the datastream. Any processing based on customer IP will be impacted by the IP obfuscation setting. This includes all Experience Cloud services which receive data from your datastream. <p>Available options:</p> <ul><li>**[!UICONTROL None]**: Disables IP obfuscation. The full user IP address will be sent via the datastream.</li><li>**[!UICONTROL Partial]**: For IPv4 addresses, obfuscates the last octet of the user IP address. For IPv6 addresses, obfuscates the last 80 bits of the address. <p>Examples:</p> <ul><li>IPv4: `1.2.3.4` -> `1.2.3.0`</li><li>IPv6: `2001:0db8:1345:fd27:0000:ff00:0042:8329` -> `2001:0db8:1345:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000`</li></ul></li><li>**[!UICONTROL Full]**: Obfuscates the entire IP address. <p>Examples:</p> <ul><li>IPv4: `1.2.3.4` -> `0.0.0.0`</li><li>IPv6: `2001:0db8:1345:fd27:0000:ff00:0042:8329` -> `0:0:0:0:0:0:0:0`</li></ul></li></ul> IP obfuscation impact on other Adobe products: <ul><li>**Adobe Target**: The datastream-level [!UICONTROL IP obfuscation] setting takes precedence over any IP obfuscation option set in Adobe Target. For example, if the datastream-level [!UICONTROL IP obfuscation] option is set to **[!UICONTROL Full]** and the Adobe Target IP obfuscation option is set to **[!UICONTROL Last octet obfuscation]**, Adobe Target will receive a fully obfuscated IP. See the Adobe Target documentation on [IP obfuscation](https://developer.adobe.com/target/before-implement/privacy/privacy/) and [geolocation](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/target/using/audiences/create-audiences/categories-audiences/geo.html?lang=en) for more details.</li><li>**Audience Manager**: The datastream-level IP obfuscation setting takes precedence over any IP obfuscation option set in Audience Manager, and it is applied to all IP addresses. Any geolocation lookup done by Audience Manager is impacted by the datastream-level [!UICONTROL IP obfuscation] option. A geolocation lookup in Audience Manager, based on a fully obfuscated IP, will result in an unknown region, and any segments based on the resulted geolocation data will not be realized. See the Audience Manager documentation on [IP obfuscation](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/audience-manager/user-guide/features/administration/ip-obfuscation.html?lang=en) for more details.</li><li>**Adobe Analytics**: Adobe Analytics currently receives the partially obfuscated IP addresses if any IP obfuscation option is selected, other than NONE. For Analytics to receive fully obfuscated IP addresses, you must configure IP obfuscation separately, in Adobe Analytics. This behavior will be updated in future releases. See the Adobe Analytics [documentation](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/analytics/admin/admin-tools/manage-report-suites/edit-report-suite/report-suite-general/general-acct-settings-admin.html) for details on how to enable IP obfuscation in Analytics.</li></ul>  |
| [!UICONTROL First Party ID Cookie] | When enabled, this setting tells the Edge Network to refer to a specified cookie when looking up a [first-party device ID](../identity/first-party-device-ids.md), rather than looking up this value in the Identity Map.<br><br>When enabling this setting, you must provide the name of the cookie where the ID is expected to be stored.|
| [!UICONTROL Third Party ID Sync] | ID syncs can be grouped into containers to allow different ID syncs to be run at different times. When enabled, this setting lets you specify which container of ID syncs is run for this datastream.|
| [!UICONTROL Third Party ID Sync Container ID] | The numeric ID of the container to be used for third party ID sync.|
| [!UICONTROL Container ID Overrides] | In this section you can define additional third party ID sync container IDs which you can use to override the default one. |
| [!UICONTROL Access Type] | Defines the authentication type that the Edge Network accepts for the datastream. <ul><li>**[!UICONTROL Mixed Authentication]**: When this option is selected, the Edge Network accepts both authenticated and unauthenticated requests. Select this option when you plan to use the Web SDK or [Mobile SDK](https://aep-sdks.gitbook.io/docs/), along with the [Server API](../../server-api/overview.md). </li><li>**[!UICONTROL Authenticated Only]**: When this option is selected, the Edge Network only accepts authenticated requests. Select this option when you plan to use only the Server API and want to prevent any unauthenticated requests from being processed by the Edge Network.</li></ul>|

From here, if you are configuring your datastream for Experience Platform, follow the tutorial on [Data Prep for Data Collection](./data-prep.md) to map your data to a Platform event schema before returning to this guide. Otherwise, select **[!UICONTROL Save]** and continue to the next section.

## View datastream details {#view-details}

After configuring a new datastream or selecting an existing one to view, the details page for that datastream appears. Here you can find further information about the datastream, including its ID.

![Details page for a created datastream](../assets/datastreams/configure/view-details.png)

From the datastream details screen, you can [add services](#add-services) to enable capabilities from the Adobe Experience Cloud products you have access to. You can also edit the datastream's [basic configuration](#create), update its [mapping rules](./data-prep.md), [copy the datastream](#copy), or delete it entirely.

## Add services to a datastream {#add-services}

On the details page of a datastream, select **[!UICONTROL Add Service]** to start adding available services for that datastream.

![Select Add Service to continue](../assets/datastreams/configure/add-service.png)

On the next screen, use the dropdown menu to select a service to configure for this datastream. Only the services that you have access to will appear in this list.

![Select a service from the list](../assets/datastreams/configure/service-selection.png)

Select the desired service, fill in the configuration options that appear, and then select **[!UICONTROL Save]** to add the service to the datastream. All added services appear in the details view for the datastream.

![Services added to a datastream](../assets/datastreams/configure/services-added.png)

The subsections below describe the configuration options for each service.

>[!NOTE]
>
>Each service configuration contains an **[!UICONTROL Enabled]** toggle that is automatically activated when the service is selected. To disable the selected service for this datastream, select the **[!UICONTROL Enabled]** toggle again.
