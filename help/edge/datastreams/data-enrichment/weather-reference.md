# Field Mappings
The fields are broken up into three different groups that align to the field groups. 

* __Current Weather__ - The current weather conditions of the user based on their location. This include current temperature, percipitation, cloud cover, etc
* __Forecasted Weather__ - The forecast includes the 1,2,3,5,7 and 10 day forecast for the users
* __Triggers__ - These triggers are specific combinations that map to different semantic weather conditions There are three different types of weather triggers. 


## Current Weather
The current weather conditions for the users location.
