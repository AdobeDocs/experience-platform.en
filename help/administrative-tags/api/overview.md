# Unified Tags API overview

The Unified Tags API lets you categorize and manage your business objects within Adobe Experience Platform. You can create both folders and tags which can be used to better organize Experience Platform objects such as audiences or datasets by using endpoints in this API.

Before reading the individual endpoint guides, please refer to the [getting started guide](./getting-started.md) for important information on required headers, reading sample API calls, and more.

## Folders

Folders are a capability that let you categorize your business objects for better object management. You can use the folder endpoint to create, manage, and delete folders in your organization.

For more information on using this endpoint, please read the [folders endpoint guide](./folders.md).

## Unified tags

Tags are a capability that let you manage metadata taxonomies to classify business objects for easier discovery and categorization. You can use the unified tags endpoint to create, manage, and delete both tags and tag categories in your organization.

For more information on using this endpoint, please read the [unified tags endpoint guide](./tags.md).
