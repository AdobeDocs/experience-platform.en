# Query Service packages

Query Service consists of two capabilities based on the Query Patterns that can be executed: 

- **Ad hoc queries** are SQL queries used to explore ingested datasets for the purpose of verification, validation, experimentation, and so on. These queries do not write data back into the Adobe Experience Platform data lake.
- **Batch queries** are SQL queries used to perform the post-ingestion processing of ingested datasets. This involves cleaning, shaping, manipulating, and enriching data. The query results are written back to the Adobe Experience Platform data lake. These queries can be scheduled, managed, and monitored as batch jobs


Query Service capabilities are packaged with the following products/add-ons:  

- Adobe Experience Platform-Based Applications (Adobe Real-Time CDP, Customer Journey Analytics and Adobe Journey Optimizer)
Query Service access to execute Adhoc Queries is provided out of the box with all flavors and tiers of Platform based applications.
- Data Distiller (Add-On package that can be purchased with Adobe Real-Time CDP, Customer Journey Analytics and Adobe Journey Optimizer)
- Query Service access to execute Batch Queries is provided with Data Distiller
