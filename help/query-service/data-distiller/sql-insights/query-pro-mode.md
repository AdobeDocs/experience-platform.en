# Query pro mode

Use query pro mode to conduct complex analysis with custom SQL queries and transform your data into easily interpretable charts.

You can [create bespoke insights and visulaizations on your dashboards](../../../dashboards/sql-insights-query-pro-mode/overview.md) and cater to both technical and non-technical audiences by downloading your insights as CSV files.
