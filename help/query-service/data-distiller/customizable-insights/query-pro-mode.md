# Query pro mode

Use query pro mode to conduct complex analysis with custom SQL queries and transform your data into easily interpretable charts. This feature allows for a greater degree of customization within your insights and filters that can suit niche use cases. You can [create bespoke insights and visulaizations on your dashboards](../../../dashboards/data-distiller/customizable-insights/overview.md) and cater to both technical and non-technical audiences by downloading your insights as CSV files.

See the query pro mode documentation to learn how to [use SQL queries to generate insights](../../../dashboards/data-distiller/customizable-insights/query-pro-mode.md) for your custom dashboards, or [download your insights as a CSV file](../../../dashboards/data-distiller/query-pro-mode/view-more.md#download-csv).
