The advanced statistics section provides a comprehensive guide on using the Data Distiller SQL extension to perform sophisticated machine learning tasks. This set of documents is designed to help you effectively implement and leverage feature engineering, model creation, and algorithmic processing using SQL. The documentation guides you through the critical aspects necessary to seamlessly integrate advanced statistical techniques into your data workflows.

## Capabilities {#capabilities}

Data Distiller equips you with the tools necessary to transform raw data into meaningful features, build and train machine learning models, and deploy these models for predictive analysis. The documentation is organized to help you understand and apply these capabilities step by step:

1. **Feature engineering**: Learn how to preprocess your data by extracting, transforming, and selecting the most relevant features. Learn about the available SQL functions that simplify and automate the feature engineering process, and how to ensure your data is optimally prepared for model training.

2. **Models**: Discover how to build, update, and manage machine learning models using SQL. Understand the core processes involved in training, testing, and deploying models, and the required SQL syntax needed to apply these techniques to your datasets.

3. **Algorithms**: Explore the machine learning algorithms supported by Data Distiller, including clustering, classification, and regression. This document details the available algorithms, their parameters, and how to configure them using SQL to generate accurate and efficient models.

### Next Steps

To learn how to perform sophisticated machine learning tasks with Data Distiller capabilities, read the [Feature Engineering](./feature-engineering.md) document. It outlines how to transform your data into features that are ready for modeling. Next, proceed to the [Models](./models.md)** document, which guides you through the process of creating, training, and managing machine learning models using the features you've engineered. Finally, explore the [Algorithms](./algorithms.md) document to understand the various machine learning methods available and how to implement them within your SQL workflows.
