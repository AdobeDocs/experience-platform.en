# Top tips to maximize value with Adobe Experience Platform Data Distiller

This page contains the sample dataset for you to apply what you learned in the session "OS656 - Top Tips to Maximize Value with Adobe Experience Platform Data Distiller". You will learn how to accelerate implementations of Adobe Real-Time Customer Data Platform and Journey Optimizer by enriching Real-Time Customer Profile data. This enrichment leverages deep insights into customer behavior patterns to build audiences for experience delivery and optimization.

Through the Luma case study, you will analyze user behavioral data and create a Recency, Frequency, Monetary (RFM) modelâ€”a marketing analysis technique for customer segmentation based on purchasing patterns.

## Prerequisite

To execute this use case, your Adobe Experience Platform instance must be licensed for [Data Distiller](./overview.md). Contact your Adobe representative for more information.

## Overview of the RFM model

RFM, short for Recency (R), Frequency (F), and Monetary (M), is a data-driven approach to customer segmentation and analysis. This methodology evaluates three key aspects of customer behavior: how recently a customer made a purchase, how often they engage, and how much they spend. By quantifying these factors, businesses can gain actionable insights into customer segments and develop targeted marketing strategies that better meet individual customer needs.

## Understanding customer behavior with the RFM model

<!-- ## How the RFM model defines customer value -->

The RFM model segments customers based on transactional behavior using three key parameters.

- **Recency** measures the time since a customer's last purchase, indicating engagement levels and future buying potential.
- **Frequency** tracks how often a customer interacts, serving as a clear indicator of loyalty and sustained engagement.
- **Monetary value** assesses the total spending by customers, highlighting their overall value to the business.

By combining these factors, businesses assign numerical scores (typically on a scale from `1` to `4`) to each customer. Lower scores indicate more favorable outcomes. For example, a customer scoring `1` in all categories is considered among the best, demonstrating recent activity, high engagement, and significant spending.

## Benefits and limitations of the RFM model

Every marketing modeling technique involves trade-offs, offering both benefits and limitations. RFM modeling is a valuable tool for understanding customer behavior and refining marketing strategies. Its advantages include segmenting customers to personalize messaging, optimize revenue, and improve response rates, retention, satisfaction, and Customer Lifetime Value (CLTV).

However, RFM modeling has limitations. It assumes uniformity within segments based on recency, frequency, and monetary value, which may oversimplify customer behavior. The model also assigns equal weight to these factors, potentially misrepresenting customer value. Additionally, it does not account for context, such as product-specific traits or customer preferences, which can lead to misinterpretations of purchasing behavior.

## Steps to build a dynamic RFM score-based SQL audience

Before starting the Luma case study, you need to ingest a sample dataset. First, [select the link to download the `luma_web_data.csv` dataset locally](../resources/luma_web_data.csv).

The sample dataset is provided in CSV format to align with the use case. In practice, you would typically source data from Adobe Analytics, Adobe Commerce, or Adobe Web/Mobile SDK.

Throughout this tutorial, you will use Data Distiller to extract relevant events and fields into a standardized CSV format. The goal is to include only essential fields while maintaining a flat data structure for efficiency and practicality.

<!-- ### Ingest the sample Luma web data -->

### Step 1: Load the CSV data into Experience Platform

Follow these steps to upload a CSV file to Adobe Experience Platform.

#### Create a dataset from a CSV file

In the Experience Platform UI, navigate to select **[!UICONTROL Workflows]** in the left navigation rail, and select **[!UICONTROL Create dataset from CSV file]** from the available options. A new sidebar appears on the right of the screen, select **[!UICONTROL Launch]**.

The [!UICONTROL Configure Dataset] panel appears. In the **[!UICONTROL Name]** field, input the dataset name as "luma_web_data" and select **[!UICONTROL Next]**.
The [!UICONTROL Add data] panel appears. Drag and drop the CSV file into the **[!UICONTROL Add data]** box, or select **[!UICONTROL Choose File]** to browse and upload the file.

#### Review and complete the upload

Once the file is uploaded, a data preview appears at the bottom of the UI. Select **[!UICONTROL Finish]** to complete the upload.

The dataset activities view for the "luma_web_data" dataset appears. The manual upload of the CSV file
is ingested as a batch, and identified by a [!UICONTROL Batch ID]. A panel on the right-side displays the table name as `luma_web_data`.

<!-- My table name is; luma_web_data_20250312_235611_817 Should we explain the suffix? -->

>[!NOTE]
>
>The SQL engine in Data Distiller queries the table name, not the dataset name.

![The "Dataset activity" tab for the newly created "luma_web_data" dataset with the table name, batch ID and "Preview dataset" highlighted.]()

Once the data has finished processing, select [!UICONTROL Preview dataset] in the top right corner to preview the dataset. The dataset preview looks like this:

#### Schema considerations

A structured XDM schema (for example, record, event, or B2B schemas) is not required because the data is imported as a raw CSV file. Instead, the dataset uses an Ad Hoc schema. 

While Data Distiller supports all schema types, the final dataset for ingestion into the Real-Time Customer Profile will use a Record XDM schema.

### Step 2: Connect to the data lake and explore available datasets

<!-- The objective of this step is to ... -->
The next objective in this process is to perform data exploration tasks in Adobe Experience Platform Data Lake to ensure data accuracy and integrity.

To generate meaningful insights from data, it's essential to ensure the accuracy and integrity of the data. When transferring data from one source to another, there's always a risk of errors, inconsistencies, or incompleteness creeping in. This is where data verification and exploration come in.

Using Data Distiller, you can perform a wide range of operations on datasets, including verifying the quality and completeness of data.

Data verification and exploration involve executing SELECT to inspect, validate, and analyze data to ensure that it has been accurately translated during the ingestion process. This process helps identify any discrepancies, inconsistencies, or missing information in the data.
