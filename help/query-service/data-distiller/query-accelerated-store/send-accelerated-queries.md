# Send accelerated queries

As part of the Data Distiller SKU, the [Query Service API](https://developer.adobe.com/experience-platform-apis/references/query-service/) allows you to make stateless queries to the accelerated store. The [accelerated queries endpoint](https://developer.adobe.com/experience-platform-apis/references/query-service/#tag/Accelerated-Queries) returns results based on aggregated data to reduce the wait time for results and provide a more interactive exchange of information.

See the [Accelerated Queries endpoint](../../api/accelerated-queries.md) documentation for instructions on how to query the accelerated store.

With the query accelerated store you can build a custom data model and/or extend an existing Adobe Real-Time Customer Data Platform data model. To engage with or embed your reporting insights into a reporting/visualization framework, see the [query accelerated store reporting insights guide](./reporting-insights-data-model.md). You can also read the Real-Time Customer Data Platform Insights Data Model documentation to learn how to [customize your SQL query templates to create Real-Time CDP reports for your marketing and key performance indicator (KPI) use cases](../../../dashboards/cdp-insights-data-model.md).
