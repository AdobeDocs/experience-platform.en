# Classification algorithms {#classification-algorithms}

This document provides an overview of various classification algorithms, focusing on their configuration, key parameters, and practical usage in advanced statistical models. Classification algorithms are used to assign categories to data points based on input features. Each section includes parameter descriptions and example code to help you implement and optimize these algorithms for tasks such as decision trees, random forest, and naive Bayes classification.

## [!DNL Decision Tree Classifier] {#decision-tree-classifier}

[!DNL Decision Tree Classifier] is a supervised learning approach used in statistics, data mining, and machine learning. In this approach, a decision tree is used as a predictive model for classification tasks, drawing conclusions from a set of observations.

**Parameters**

The table below outlines key parameters for configuring and optimizing the performance of a [!DNL Decision Tree Classifier].

| Parameter                    | Description                | Default value | Possible Values |
|-------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------|------------------|
| `MAX_BINS`                    | The maximum number of bins determines how continuous features are divided into discrete intervals. This affects how features are split at each decision tree node. More bins provide higher granularity.    | 32            | Must be at least 2 and at least equal to the number of categories in any categorical feature. |
| `CACHE_NODE_IDS`              | If `false`, the algorithm passes trees to executors to match instances with nodes. If `true`, the algorithm caches node IDs for each instance, speeding up the training of deeper trees.             | `false`         | `true`, `false` |
| `CHECKPOINT_INTERVAL`         | Specifies how often to checkpoint the cached node IDs. For example, `10` means that the cache is checkpointed every 10 iterations.                                                                               | 10            | (>= 1)            |
| `IMPURITY`                    | The criterion used for information gain calculation (case-insensitive).                                                                                                                                     | "gini"        | `entropy`, `gini` |
| `MAX_DEPTH`                   | The maximum depth of the tree (non-negative). For example, depth `0` means 1 leaf node, and depth `1` means 1 internal node and 2 leaf nodes.                                                               | 5             | [0, 30]           |

| `MIN_WEIGHT_FRACTION_PER_NODE` | The minimum fraction of the weighted sample count that each child must have after a split. If a split causes the fraction of the total weight in either child to be less than this value, it is discarded. | 0.0           | (>= 0.0, <= 0.5)  |
| `MIN_INSTANCES_PER_NODE`      | The minimum number of instances each child must have after a split. If a split results in fewer instances than this value, the split is discarded.                                                          | 1             | (>= 1)            |
| `MAX_MEMORY_IN_MB`            | The maximum memory, in MB, allocated to histogram aggregation. If this value is too small, only 1 node is split per iteration, and its aggregates may exceed this size.                                | 256           |                    |

| `SEED`                        | The random seed.                                                                                                                                                                                            | NOT SET       | Any 64-bit number  |
| `WEIGHT_COL`                  | The column name, for instance,  weights. If not set or empty, all instance weights are treated as `1.0`.                                                                                                       | NOT SET       | Any string        |
| `ONE_VS_REST`                 | Enables or disables wrapping this algorithm with One-vs-Rest, used for multiclass classification problems.                                                                                                  | `false`        | `true`, `false`   |

## [!DNL Logistic Regression] {#logistic-regression}

[!DNL Logistic Regression] is a supervised algorithm used for binary classification. It models the probability that an instance belongs to a class using the logistic function, making it suitable for tasks where the goal is to classify instances into one of two categories.

[!DNL Multilayer Perceptron Classifier] is a feedforward artificial neural network classifier that consists of multiple fully connected layers of nodes. Each node in a layer maps inputs to outputs using a weighted linear combination of the input data, with node weights (`w`) and bias (`b`), followed by an activation function.

## [!DNL Naive Bayes Classifier] {#naive-bayes-classifier}

[!DNL Naive Bayes Classifier] is a simple probabilistic, multiclass classifier based on Bayes' theorem with strong (naive) independence assumptions between features. It is highly efficient in training, requiring only a single pass over the training data to compute the conditional probability distribution of each feature given each label. For predictions, it uses Bayes' theorem to compute the conditional probability distribution of each label given an observation.
