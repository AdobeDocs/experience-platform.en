# Clustering algorithms {#clustering-algorithms}

Clustering algorithms group data points into distinct clusters based on their similarities, enabling unsupervised learning to uncover patterns within the data. To create a clustering algorithm, use the `type` parameter in the `OPTIONS` clause to specify the algorithm you want to use for model training. Next, define the relevant parameters as key-value pairs to fine-tune the model.

>[!NOTE]
>
>Ensure you understand the parameter requirements for the chosen algorithm. If you choose not to customize certain parameters, the system applies default settings. Consult the relevant documentation to understand each parameter's function and default values.

## [!DNL K-Means] {#kmeans}

## [!DNL Bisecting K-means] {#bisecting-kmeans}

[!DNL Bisecting K-means] is a hierarchical clustering algorithm that uses a divisive (or "top-down") approach. All observations start in a single cluster, and splits are performed recursively as the hierarchy is built.

| `SUBSAMPLING_RATE`            | For the `online` optimizer: the fraction of the corpus sampled and used in each iteration of mini-batch gradient descent, in the range `(0, 1]`.                        | 0.05           | `(0, 1]`                                   |
| `TOPIC_CONCENTRATION`         | The concentration parameter ("beta" or "eta") defines the prior assumptions placed on topics' distributions over terms. The default value is determined by the optimizer: For `EM`, values > 1.0 (default = 0.1 + 1). For `online`, values ≥ 0 (default = 1.0/k). | Automatic         | Any single value or vector of length k |
| `TOPIC_DISTRIBUTION_COL` | This parameter outputs the estimated topic mixture distribution for each document, often referred to as "theta" in the literature. For empty documents, it returns a vector of zeros. Estimates are derived using a variational approximation ("gamma").                                                      | NOT SET           | Any string                        |
