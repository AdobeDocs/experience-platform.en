# Regression algorithms {#regression-algorithms}

This document provides an overview of various regression algorithms, focusing on their configuration, key parameters, and practical usage in advanced statistical models. Regression algorithms are used to model the relationship between dependent and independent variables, predicting continuous outcomes based on observed data. Each section includes parameter descriptions and example code to help you implement and optimize these algorithms for tasks such as linear, random forest, and survival regression.

<!-- Adding this so it shows in Github Preview -->

[!DNL Decision Tree] learning is a supervised learning method used in statistics, data mining, and machine learning. In this approach, a classification or regression decision tree is used as a predictive model to draw conclusions about a set of observations.

The table below outlines key parameters for configuring and optimizing the performance of decision tree models.

| Parameter                   | Description                                                                                                                                                                                         | Default value | Possible Values                                                                                       |
|------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `MAX_BINS`                   | This parameter specifies the maximum number of bins used to discretize continuous features and determine splits at each node. More bins result in finer granularity and detail.                      | 32            | Must be at least 2 and at least the number of categories in any categorical feature.                    |
| `CACHE_NODE_IDS`             | This parameter determines whether to cache node IDs for each instance. If `false`, the algorithm passes trees to executors to match instances with nodes. If `true`, the algorithm caches node IDs for each instance, which can speed up the training of deeper trees. Users can configure how often the cache should be checkpointed or disable it by setting `CHECKPOINT_INTERVAL`. | false         | `true` or `false` |
| `CHECKPOINT_INTERVAL`        | This parameter specifies how often the cached node IDs should be checkpointed. For example, setting it to `10` means the cache will be checkpointed every 10 iterations. This is only applicable if `CACHE_NODE_IDS` is set to `true` and the checkpoint directory is configured in `org.apache.spark.SparkContext`.                       | 10            | (>=1)  |

The depth must be within the range `[0, 30]`.                                                                | 5             | [0, 30]                                                                                                |

| `MIN_WEIGHT_FRACTION_PER_NODE` | This parameter specifies the minimum fraction of the weighted sample count that each child node must have after a split. If either child node has a fraction less than this value, the split will be discarded. | 0.0           | [0.0, 0.5]                                                                                             |
| `MIN_INSTANCES_PER_NODE`     | This parameter sets the minimum number of instances that each child node must have after a split. If a split results in fewer instances than this value, the split will be discarded as invalid.     | 1             | (>=1)                                                                                                  |
| `MAX_MEMORY_IN_MB`           | This parameter specifies the maximum memory, in megabytes (MB), allocated for histogram aggregation. If the memory is too small, only one node will be split per iteration, and its aggregates may exceed this size.                                                             | 256           | Any positive integer value                                                                             |

## [!DNL Survival Regression] {#survival-regression}

[!DNL Survival Regression] is used to fit a parametric survival regression model, known as the [!DNL Accelerated Failure Time] (AFT) model, based on the [!DNL Weibull distribution]. It can stack instances into blocks for enhanced performance.

**Parameters**

The table below outlines key parameters for configuring and optimizing the performance of [!DNL Survival Regression].

| `CENSOR_COL`             | The column name for censoring. A value of `1` indicates that the event has occurred (uncensored), while `0` means the event is censored.                                                            | "censor"      | 0, 1            |
