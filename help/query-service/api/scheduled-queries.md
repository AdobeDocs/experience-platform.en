# Schedules endpoint

## Sample API calls

Now that you understand what headers to use, you are ready to begin making calls to the [!DNL Query Service] API. The following sections walk through the various API calls you can make using the [!DNL Query Service] API. Each call includes the general API format, a sample request showing required headers, and a sample response.

### Retrieve a list of scheduled queries

You can retrieve a list of all scheduled queries for your organization by making a GET request to the `/schedules` endpoint. 

**API format**

```http
GET /schedules
GET /schedules?{QUERY_PARAMETERS}
```

| Property | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| `{QUERY_PARAMETERS}` | (*Optional*) Parameters added to the request path which configure the results returned in the response. Multiple parameters can be included, separated by ampersands (`&`). The available parameters are listed below. |

**Query parameters**

The following is a list of available query parameters for listing scheduled queries. All of these parameters are optional. Making a call to this endpoint with no parameters will retrieve all scheduled queries available for your organization.

| Parameter | Description |
| --------- | ----------- |
| `orderby` | Specifies the field by which to order results. The supported fields are `created` and `updated`. For example, `orderby=created` will sort results by created in ascending order. Adding a `-` before created (`orderby=-created`) will sort items by created in descending order. |
| `limit` | Specifies the page size limit to control the number of results that are included in a page. (*Default value: 20*) |
| `start` | Specify an ISO format timestamp to order the results. If no start date is specified, the API call will return the oldest created scheduled query first, then continue to list more recent results.<br> ISO timestamps allow for different levels of granularity in the date and time. The basic ISO timestamps take the format of: `2020-09-07` to express the date September 7, 2020. A more complex example would be written as `2022-11-05T08:15:30-05:00` and corresponds to November 5, 2022, 8:15:30 am, US Eastern Standard Time. A timezone can be provided with a UTC offset and is denoted by the suffix "Z" (`2020-01-01T01:01:01Z`). If no timezone is provided, it defaults to zero. |
| `property` | Filter results based on fields. The filters **must** be HTML escaped. Commas are used to combine multiple sets of filters. The supported fields are `created`, `templateId`, and `userId`. The list of supported operators are `>` (greater than), `<` (less than), and `==` (equal to). For example, `userId==6ebd9c2d-494d-425a-aa91-24033f3abeec` will return all scheduled queries where the user ID is as specified. |

**Request**

The following request retrieves the latest scheduled query created for your organization.

```shell
curl -X GET https://platform.adobe.io/data/foundation/query/schedules?limit=1
 -H 'Authorization: Bearer {ACCESS_TOKEN}' \
 -H 'x-gw-ims-org-id: {ORG_ID}' \
 -H 'x-api-key: {API_KEY}' \
 -H 'x-sandbox-name: {SANDBOX_NAME}'
```

**Response**

A successful response returns HTTP status 200 with a list of scheduled queries for the specified organization. The following response returns the latest scheduled query created for your organization.

### Create a new scheduled query

You can create a new scheduled query by making a POST request to the `/schedules` endpoint. When you create a scheduled query in the API, you can also see it in the Query Editor. For more information on scheduled queries in the UI, please read the [Query Editor documentation](../ui/user-guide.md#scheduled-queries).

**API format**

```http
POST /schedules
```

**Request**

```shell
curl -X POST https://platform.adobe.io/data/foundation/query/schedules
 -H 'Authorization: Bearer {ACCESS_TOKEN}' \
 -H 'x-gw-ims-org-id: {ORG_ID}' \
 -H 'x-api-key: {API_KEY}' \
 -H 'x-sandbox-name: {SANDBOX_NAME}'

         "description": "A sample of a scheduled query."
     }, 
     "schedule": {
         "schedule": "30 * * * *",
         "startDate": "2020-01-08T12:30:00.000Z"
     }
 }
 '
```

| Property | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| `query.dbName` | The name of the database you are creating a scheduled query for. |
| `query.sql` | The SQL query you want to create. |
| `query.name` | The name of the scheduled query. |
| `schedule.schedule` | The cron schedule for the query. For more information about cron schedules, please read the [cron expression format](https://www.quartz-scheduler.org/documentation/quartz-2.3.0/tutorials/crontrigger.html) documentation. In this example, "30 * * * *" means that the query will run every hour at the 30 minute mark.<br><br>Alternatively, you can use the following shorthand expressions:<ul><li>`@once`: The query only runs once.</li><li>`@hourly`: The query runs every hour at the beginning of the hour. This is equivalent to the cron expression `0 * * * *`.</li><li>`@daily`: The query runs once a day at midnight. This is equivalent to the cron expression `0 0 * * *`.</li><li>`@weekly`: The query runs once a week, on Sunday, at midnight. This is equivalent to the cron expression `0 0 * * 0`.</li><li>`@monthly`: The query runs once a month, on the first day of the month, at midnight. This is equivalent to the cron expression `0 0 1 * *`.</li><li>`@yearly`: The query runs once a year, on January 1st, at midnight. This is equivalent to the cron expression `1 0 0 1 1 *`. |
| `schedule.startDate` | The start date for your scheduled query, written as a UTC timestamp. |

**Response**

A successful response returns HTTP status 202 (Accepted) with details of your newly created scheduled query. Once the scheduled query is finished activating, the `state` will change from `REGISTERING` to `ENABLED`.

```

| Property | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| `op`  | The operation to be performed on the query schedule. The accepted value is `replace`.  |
| `path` | The path of the value you want to patch. In this case, since you are updating the scheduled query's state, you need to set the value of `path` to `/state`. |
| `value` | The updated value of the `/state`. This value can either be set as `enable` or `disable` to enable or disable the scheduled query. |

**Response**

A successful response returns HTTP status 202 (Accepted) with the following message.

```json
{
    "message": "Request to patch accepted",
    "statusCode": 202
}
```

### Update scheduled query schedule

You can update the cron schedule of the scheduled query by setting the `path` property to `/schedule/schedule` in the request body. For more information about cron schedules, please read the [cron expression format](https://www.quartz-scheduler.org/documentation/quartz-2.3.0/tutorials/crontrigger.html) documentation.

**API format**

```http
PATCH /schedules/{SCHEDULE_ID}
```

| Property | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| `{SCHEDULE_ID}` | The `id` value of the scheduled query you want to PATCH. |

**Request**

This API request uses the JSON Patch syntax for its payload. For more information on how JSON Patch works, please read the API fundamentals document. 

```shell
curl -X PATCH https://platform.adobe.io/data/foundation/query/schedules/e95186d65a28abf00a495d82_28e74200-e3de-11e9-8f5d-7f27416c5f0d_sample_scheduled_query7omob151bm_birvwm

             "value": "45 * * * *"
         }
     ]
 }'
```

| Property | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| `op`  | The operation to be performed on the query schedule. The accepted value is `replace`.  |
| `path` | The path of the value you want to patch. In this case, since you are updating the scheduled query's schedule, you need to set the value of `path` to `/schedule/schedule`. |
| `value` | The updated value of the `/schedule`. This value needs to be in the form of a cron schedule. So, in this example, the scheduled query will run every hour at the 45 minute mark. |

**Response**

A successful response returns HTTP status 202 (Accepted) with the following message.

```json
{
    "message": "Request to patch accepted",
    "statusCode": 202

```

### Delete a specified scheduled query

You can delete a specified scheduled query by making a DELETE request to the `/schedules` endpoint and providing the ID of the scheduled query you want to delete in the request path.
