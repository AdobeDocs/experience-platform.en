The key metrics section displays visualizations of important data that helps you monitor Query Service usage. For each chart, you can select the ellipse (`...`) in the top right followed by [!UICONTROL View more] to view either a tabulated form of the results, or download the data as a CSV file to view in a spreadsheet. For more details, refer to the [View more guide](../../dashboards/sql-insights-query-pro-mode/view-more.md).

#### Set a date filter {#set-date-filter}

To apply a global date filter for these visualizations, select the filter icon (![A filter icon.](../../images/icons/filter-icon-white.png)) and adjust the date range in the **[!UICONTROL Filters]** dialog. Apply this filter to tailor the displayed metrics for a specific time frame and enhance the relevance of your analysis.

## Query Editor

The Query Editor enables you to write and execute queries without using an external client. Select **[!UICONTROL Create Query]** to open the Query Editor and create a new query. You can also access the Query Editor by selecting a query from the **[!UICONTROL Log]** or **[!UICONTROL Templates]** tabs. Selecting a previously executed or saved query will open the Query Editor and display the SQL for the selected query.

![The Queries dashboard with Create Query highlighted.](../images/ui/overview/overview-create-query.png)

Query Editor provides editing space where you can begin typing a query. As you type, the editor automatically completes SQL reserved words, tables, and field names within tables. When finished writing your query, select the **Play** button to run the query. The **[!UICONTROL Console]** tab below the editor shows what Query Service is currently doing, indicating when a query has been returned. The **[!UICONTROL Result]** tab, next to the Console, displays query results. See the [Query Editor guide](./user-guide.md) for more information on using the Query Editor.

![A zoomed in view of the Query Editor.](../images/ui/overview/query-editor.png)

## Scheduled queries {#scheduled-queries}

Queries that have already been saved as a template can be scheduled to run on a regular cadence. When scheduling a query, you can choose the frequency of runs, the start and end date, the day of the week the scheduled query runs, as well as the dataset to export the query to. Query schedules are set using Query Editor.

To learn how to schedule a query through the UI, see the [scheduled queries guide](./user-guide.md#scheduled-queries). To learn how to add schedules using the API, please read the [scheduled queries endpoint guide](../api/scheduled-queries.md).

Once a query has been scheduled it appears in the list of scheduled queries on the [!UICONTROL Scheduled Queries] tab. Full details regarding the query, runs, creator, and timings can be found by selecting a scheduled query from the list.

![The Queries workspace with the Scheduled Queries tab highlighted and displaying rows of query schedules.](../images/ui/overview/scheduled-queries.png)

<!--  -->

| Column | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **[!UICONTROL Name]** | The name field is either the template name or the first few characters of your SQL query. Any query created through the UI with the Query Editor is named at inception. If the query was created through the API then the name of the query is a snippet of the initial SQL used to create the query. |
| **[!UICONTROL Template]** | The template name of the query. Select a template name to navigate to the Query Editor. The query template is displayed in the Query Editor for convenience. If there is no template name, the row is marked with a hyphen and there is no ability to redirect to the Query Editor to view the query.   |
| **[!UICONTROL SQL]** | A snippet of the SQL query.  |
| **[!UICONTROL Run frequency]** |  This is the cadence at which your query is set to run. The available values are `Run once` and `Scheduled`. Queries can be filtered according to their run frequency. |
| **[!UICONTROL Created by]** | The name of the user who created the query.  |
| **[!UICONTROL Created]** |  The timestamp when the query was created, in UTC format.  |
| **[!UICONTROL Last run timestamp]** | The most recent timestamp when the query was run. This column highlights whether a query has been executed according to its current schedule. |
| **[!UICONTROL Last run status]** | The status of the most recent query execution. The three status values are: `successful` `failed` or `in progress`.|

See the documentation for more information on how to [monitor queries through the Query Service UI](./monitor-queries.md).

## Templates {#browse}

The **[!UICONTROL Templates]** tab shows queries saved by users in your organization. It is useful to think of these as query projects, as queries saved here may still be under construction. Queries displayed on the **[!UICONTROL Templates]** tab also display as run queries in the **[!UICONTROL Log]** tab if they have been previously executed by Query Service.

![A zoomed in view of the Queries dashboard Templates tab displaying several saved queries.](../images/ui/overview/templates.png)

| Column | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **[!UICONTROL Name]** | The name field is either the query name created by the user or the first few characters of your SQL query. Any query created through the UI with the Query Editor is named at inception. If the query was created through the API then the name of the query is a snippet of the initial SQL used to create the query. You can select the query name to open the query in the Query Editor. You can also use the search bar to search for the [!UICONTROL Name] of a query. Searches are case sensitive. |
| **[!UICONTROL SQL]** | The first few characters of the SQL query. Hovering over the code displays the full query. |
| **[!UICONTROL Modified by]** | The last user who modified the query. Any user in your organization with access to Query Service can modify queries. |
| **[!UICONTROL Last modified]** | The date and time of the last modification to the query, in the browser's time zone. |

See the [query templates](./query-templates.md) documentation for more information on templates in the Platform UI.

## Log {#log}

The **[!UICONTROL Log]** tab provides a list of queries that have previously been executed. By default, the log lists the queries in reverse chronology.

![A zoomed in view of the Queries dashboard Log tab displaying a list of queries in reverse chronological order.](../images/ui/overview/log.png)

| Column | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **[!UICONTROL Name]** | The query name, consisting of the first several characters of the SQL query. Select the template name to open the [!UICONTROL Query log details] view for that run. You can use the search bar to search on the name of a query. Searches are case sensitive. |
| **[!UICONTROL Start time]** | The time that the query was executed. |
| **[!UICONTROL Complete time]** | The time that the query run completed. |
| **[!UICONTROL Status]** | The current status of the query. |
| **[!UICONTROL Dataset]** | The input dataset used by the query. Select the dataset to go to the input dataset details screen. |
| **[!UICONTROL Client]** | The client used for the query. |
| **[!UICONTROL Created by]** | The name of the person who created the query. |

>![Note]
>
>Select the pencil icon (![A pencil icon.](/help/images/icons/edit.png)) from any row of the query log to navigate to the Query Editor. The query is pre-populated for convenient editing.

See the [query logs documentation](./query-logs.md) for more information on the log files automatically generated by a query event.

## Credentials

The **[!UICONTROL Credentials]** tab displays both your expiring and non-expiring credentials. For more information on how to use these credentials to connect with external clients, please read the [credentials guide](../clients/overview.md).

![The Queries dashboard with the Credentials tab highlighted.](../images/ui/overview/credentials.png)

## Next steps

Now that you are familiar with Query Service user interface on [!DNL Platform], you can access Query Editor to start creating your own query projects to share with other users in your organization. For more information on authoring and running queries in Query Editor, see the [Query Editor user guide](./user-guide.md).
