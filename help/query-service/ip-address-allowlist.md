## Overview {#overview}

This page provides IP addresses that you can add to your allowlist, to safely export data from Experience Platform to your [SFTP server](../destinations/catalog/cloud-storage/sftp.md).

You can define network access controls through your network firewall. By specifying the appropriate IP range, you can allow traffic for the data transfer service.

Adobe recommends that you add the following IP ranges to an allowlist depending on your region. Failing to add your region-specific IP range to your allowlist may lead to errors or non-performance.
