# Derived attributes

Derived attributes allows you to compute attributes on a regular cadence and optionally publish these derived attributes into Profiles as profile attributes.

## SQL support for derived attributes

Adobe Experience Platform Query Service allows you to set an identity or a primary identity for ad hoc schema dataset fields directly through SQL. See the documentation on [setting a secondary identity and primary identity in ad hoc schema identities](../data-governance/ad-hoc-schema-identities.md) for more information.

## Identify the schema for profile

(This takes place in ....... outside query service)
Please see the ....documentation for detailed instruction on how to enable a schema for Profile

## Building derived attributes

Deciles are one example of derived attributes that are necessary for a variety of use cases with Profile data. (What is a Decile?)
