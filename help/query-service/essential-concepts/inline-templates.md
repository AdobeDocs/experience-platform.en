# Inline templates

Inline templates allow you to reuse multiple conditions in numerous queries. You can save criteria in a template and then reuse them in multiple queries. This reduces development effort and the risk of errors from copying long statements between queries as you only need to make changes in one location and have those changes reflect in any query that references this template. 

## Prerequisites

Inline templates are supported by both the UI and the Query Service API. See the documentation for information on how to [create a query template through the API](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-platform/query/api/query-templates.html?lang=en#create-a-query-template) or with the [Query Editor](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-platform/query/ui/user-guide.html?lang=en#query-authoring)

## Create an inline template

Once a query is saved, it is known as a template. When the template references another template within the statement, it is called an inline template. Inline templates are indicated in your SQL through the use of the hash (#) followed by the template name. Query Service replaces the template name starting from the hash tag with the statement saved as a template in that name.

>[!NOTE]
>
>Query templates can call any number of other inline templates. There is no restriction on the number of inline templates you can invoke from a single query. Templates can also be nested within other inline templates.

You can use templates to store one, or multiple conditions. They do not need to be a complete query by themselves. If your template contains a valid query, you can execute the query simply by calling the template name preceded with a hash tag. For example, if you stored `SELECT * FROM JUNE_2023_LOYALTY_MEMBERS;` as a template  named `JUNE_2023_LOYALTY_MEMBERS`, the command  `#JUNE_2023_LOYALTY_MEMBERS;` would execute the valid query contained inside the template. 



## Next steps

After reading this document, you now know how to reference other templates within your SQL either in the Query Editor or throguh the Query Service API.  

After reading this document, you now know when to use the credentials endpoint and how to set up a credentials configuration using the `/authoring/credentials` API endpoint  Read [how to use Destination SDK to configure your destination](../guides/configure-destination-instructions.md) to understand where this step fits into the process of configuring your destination.

 
<!-- 
The following SQL demonstrates an example of a pramaterized query. 

```sql
SELECT * FROM #databaseName.#tableName WHERE #template5;
```

and the following templates are called to complete the query.

```sql
databaseName = 'acmeProfiles2023'
tableName = 'loyaltyMembers'
template5 = 'city: #cityName;'
cityName = 'ReykjavÃ­k'
```

In this scenario, there would be statements saved as query templates for `databaseName`, `tableName`, `template5`, and `cityName`. -->

<!-- ## Update parameterized templates

You can replace parameterized templates through either the UI, or the API.

**Request**

```sql
SELECT * FROM csv1000 ROWS WHERE id = '1000' AND firstname = 'elin' AND lastname = 'holder' AND gender = 'male' AND email = 'abc1000@gmail.com' AND city = 'surprise' AND country = 'usa' AND postalcode = '14579' limit 5;
```

* `your_test_template_01`: `email = '$email' AND #your_test_template_02`
* `your_test_template_02`:`street = '$street' AND email = '$email' AND #your_test_template_03 AND #your_test_template_03` 
* `your_test_template_03`: `$fieldName = '$fieldValue`


### Update parameters through the UI

Description

### Update parameters through the API

Changes to query templates can be made using a PUT request to the query templates endpoint. Complete instructions on how to do this can be found in the [query templates endpoint guide](../api/query-templates.md#update-a-specified-query-template) and the [accelerated queries endpoint guide](../api/accelerated-queries#run-accelerated-query). 

If a template uses multiple parameterized values then these must be provided in an array of values. Paramateterized queries that do not have any other nested information can be provided in flat JSON.


If parameter in the query and the parameter in the template may have the same name, you must distinguish between the two.

If you do not prove a value of parameter inside a nested template, the value is taken from its parent template.

 We could provide them in this in a flat JSON, but if it is using templates we need to provide it in a nested just because parameter in a query and parameter in the in the template right?
They may have same name, so we need to  right?


It's where it's parent or it's it's parents, wherever it in the higher in the up in the hierarchy it will get the parameter reduced from there, otherwise it will use what is provided and it's own element OK.



You can use the CLI to use parameterized queries. but you must use the PREPARE statement and include the (query ?) in JSON format in within the command.  
You can check the parameters and templates but entering the SHOW TEMPLATES command. 




You can escape characters inside template names that include spaces / single quote marks / backslashes by putting them inside single quote marks and escaping them with a backslash 

Best practice is to avoid using spaces, single quote, and backslash in template names
