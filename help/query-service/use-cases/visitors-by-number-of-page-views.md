# List visitors by their number of page views

This document provides an example of the SQL required to retrieve a list of visitors organized by the number of page views. With Adobe Experience Platform Query Service, you can write queries that use [!DNL Experience Events] to capture a variety of use cases. Experience Events are represented by the Experience Data Model (XDM) ExperienceEvent class, which captures an immutable and non-aggregated snapshot of the system when a user interacts with a website or service. Experience Events can even be used for time-domain analysis. See the [next steps section](#next-steps) for more use cases that involve [!DNL Experience Events] to generate visitor reports.

More information about XDM and [!DNL Experience Events] can be found in the [[!DNL XDM System] overview](../../xdm/home.md). By combining Query Service with [!DNL Experience Events], you can effectively track behavioral trends amongst your users. The following document provides examples of queries involving [!DNL Experience Events].

## Objective

The following example creates a report that lists the 10 IDs of the users who have viewed the most pages.

```sql
SELECT 
endUserIds._experience.aaid.id, 
SUM(web.webPageDetails.pageviews.value) as pageViews 
FROM your_analytics_table
GROUP BY endUserIds._experience.aaid.id 
ORDER BY pageViews DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

The query results are displayed in the table below.

```console
               id                  | pageViews
