# Fuzzy match in Query Service

Use a 'fuzzy' match on your Adobe Experience Platform data to return the most likely, approximate matches without the need to search for strings with identical characters. This allows for much a more flexible search of your data and makes your data more accessible by saving time and effort.

Instead of trying to re-format the search strings in order to match them, the fuzzy match analyzes the ratio of similarity between two sequences and returns the percentage of similarity. [[!DNL FuzzyWuzzy]](https://pypi.org/project/fuzzywuzzy/) is recommended for this process as its functions are more suited to help match strings in more complex situations compared to [!DNL regex] or [!DNL difflib].

The example provided in this use case focuses on matching similar attributes from a hotel room search across two different travel agency datasets. The document demonstrates how to match strings by their degree of similarity from large separate data sources. In this example, fuzzy match compares the search results for the features of a room from the Luma and Acme travel agencies.

## Getting started {#getting-started}

As part of this process requires you to train a machine learning model, this document assumes a working knowledge of one or more machine learning environments.

This example uses [!DNL Python] and the [!DNL Jupyter Notebook] development environment. Although there are many options available, [!DNL Jupyter Notebook] is recommended because it is an open-source web application that has low computational requirements. It can be downloaded from [the official Jupyter site](https://jupyter.org/). 

Before you begin, you must import the necessary libraries. [!DNL FuzzyWuzzy] is an open-sourced [!DNL Python] library built on top of the [!DNL difflib] library and used to match strings. It uses [!DNL Levenshtein Distance] to calculate the differences between sequences and patterns. [!DNL FuzzyWuzzy] has the following requirements:

- [!DNL Python] 2.4 (or higher)
- [!DNL Python-Levenshtein]

From the command line, use the following command to install [!DNL FuzzyWuzzy]:

```console
pip install fuzzywuzzy
```

Or use the following command to install [!DNL Python-Levenshtein] as well:

```console
pip install fuzzywuzzy[speedup]
```

More technical information on [!DNL Fuzzywuzzy] can be found in their [official documentation](https://pypi.org/project/fuzzywuzzy/).

### Connect to Query Service

You must connect your machine learning model to Query Service by providing your connection credentials. Both expiring and non-expiring credentials can be provided. Please see the [credentials guide](../ui/credentials.md) for more information on how to acquire the necessary credentials. If you are using [!DNL Jupyter Notebook], please read the full guide on [how to connect to Query Service](../clients/jupyter-notebook.md).

Also, be sure to import the [!DNL numpy] package into your [!DNL Python] environment to enable linear algebra.

```python
import numpy as np
```

The commands below are necessary to connect to Query Service from [!DNL Jupyter Notebook]:

```python
import psycopg2
conn = psycopg2.connect('''
sslmode=require
host=<YOUR_ORGANIZATION_ID>
port=80
dbname=prod:all
user=<YOUR_ADOBE_ID_TO_CONNECT_TO_QUERY_SERVICE>
password=<YOUR_QUERY_SERVICE_PASSWORD>
''')
cur = conn.cursor()
```

Your [!DNL Jupyter Notebook] instance is now connected to Query Service. If the connection is successful, no message will display. If the connection failed, an error will display. 

### Draw data from the Luma dataset {#luma-dataset}

Data for analysis is drawn from the first dataset with the following commands. For brevity, the examples have been limited to the first 10 results of the column.

```python
cur.execute('''SELECT * FROM luma;
''')    
luma = np.array([r[0] for r in cur])

luma[:10]
```

Select **Output** to display the returned array.

+++Output

```console
array(['Deluxe King Or Queen Room', 'Kona Tower City / Mountain View',
       'Luxury Double Room', 'Alii Tower Ocean View With King Bed',
       'Club Two Queen', 'Corner Deluxe Studio',
       'Luxury Queen Room With Two Queen Beds', 'Grand Corner King Room',
       'Accessible Club Ocean View Suite With One King Bed',
       'Junior Suite'], dtype='<U66')
```

+++

### Draw data from the Acme dataset {#acme-dataset}

Data for analysis is now drawn from the second dataset with the following commands. Again, for brevity, the examples have been limited to the first 10 results of the column.

```python
cur.execute('''SELECT * FROM acme;
''')    
acme = np.array([r[0] for r in cur])

acme[:10]
```

Select **Output** to display the returned array.

+++Output

```console
array(['Deluxe King Or Queen Room', 'Kona Tower City / Mountain View',
       'Luxury Double Room', 'Alii Tower Ocean View With King Bed',
       'Club Two Queen', 'Corner Deluxe Studio',
       'Luxury Queen Room With Two Queen Beds', 'Grand Corner King Room',
       'Accessible Club Ocean View Suite With One King Bed',
       'Junior Suite'], dtype='<U66')
```

+++

### Create a fuzzy scoring function {#fuzzy-scoring}

Next, you must import `fuzz` from the FuzzyWuzzy library and execute a partial ratio comparison of the strings. The partial ratio function allows you to perform substring matching. This takes the shortest string and matches it with all substrings that are of the same length. The function returns a percentage similarity ratio of up to 100%. For example, the partial ratio function would compare the following strings 'Deluxe Room', '1 King Bed', and 'Deluxe King Room' and return a similarity score of 69%. 

In the hotel room match use case, this is done using the following commands:

```python
from fuzzywuzzy import fuzz
def compute_match_score(x,y):
    return fuzz.partial_ratio(x,y)
```

Next, import `cdist` from the [!DNL SciPy] library to compute the distance between each pair in the two collections of inputs. This computes the scores among all pairs of hotel rooms provided by each of the travel agencies.

```python
from scipy.spatial.distance import cdist
pairwise_distance =  cdist(luma.reshape((-1,1)),acme.reshape((-1,1)),compute_match_score)
```

### Create mappings between the two columns using the fuzzy join score

Now that the columns have been scored based on distance, you can index the pairs and retain only matches that scored higher than a certain percentage. This example only retains pairs that matched with a score of 70% or higher. 

```python
matched_pairs = []
for i,c1 in enumerate(luma):
    idx = np.where(pairwise_distance[i,:] > 70)[0]
    for j in idx:
        matched_pairs.append((luma[i].replace("'","''"),acme[j].replace("'","''")))
```

The results can be displayed with the following command. For brevity, the results are limited to ten rows.

```python
matched_pairs[:10]
```

Select **Output** to see the results.

+++Output

```console

[('Deluxe Room, 1 King Bed', 'Deluxe Room - One King Bed'),
 ('Standard Room, Lagoon View', 'Standard Room With Ocean View'),
 ('Standard Room, Lagoon View', 'Standard Room Dolphin Lagoon View'),
 ('Deluxe Room, 2 Queen Beds', 'Deluxe Room - Two Queen Beds'),
 ('Deluxe Room, 2 Queen Beds', 'Deluxe Room - One King Bed'),
 ('Deluxe Room, 1 King Bed', 'Deluxe Room - One King Bed'),
 ('Deluxe Room, 1 King Bed', 'Deluxe Room - One King Bed'),
 ('Premier Room, 1 King Bed', 'Royal Club Premier Room - One King Bed'),
 ('Deluxe Room, Corner', 'Deluxe Room (Non Refundable)'),
 ('Deluxe Suite', 'Corner Deluxe Studio')]
```

+++

The results are then matched using SQL with the following command:

<!-- Q) Why and is this accurate? -->

```python
matching_sql = ' OR '.join(["(e.luma = '{}' AND b.acme = '{}')".format(c1,c2) for c1,c2 in matched_pairs])
```

## Apply the mappings to do fuzzy join in Query Service {#mappings-for-query-service}

Next, the high-scoring matching pairs are joined using SQL to create a new dataset. 

```python
:
cur.execute('''
SELECT *  FROM luma e
CROSS JOIN acme b
WHERE 
{}
'''.format(matching_sql)) 
[r for r in cur]
```

Select **Output** to see the results of this join.

### Save fuzzy match results to Platform {#save-to-platform}

Finally, the results of the fuzzy match can be saved as a dataset for use in Adobe Experience Platform using SQL.

```python
cur.execute(''' 
Create table luma_acme_join
AS
(SELECT *  FROM luma e
CROSS JOIN acme b
WHERE 
{})
'''.format(matching_sql))
```
