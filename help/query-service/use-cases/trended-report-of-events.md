# Create a trended report of events

This document provides an example of the SQL required to create a trended report of events by day over a specific date range. With Adobe Experience Platform Query Service, you can write queries that use [!DNL Experience Events] to capture a variety of use cases. Experience Events are represented by the Experience Data Model (XDM) ExperienceEvent class, which captures an immutable and non-aggregated snapshot of the system when a user interacts with a website or service. Experience Events can even be used for time-domain analysis. See the [next steps section](#next-steps) for more use cases that involve [!DNL Experience Events] to generate visitor reports.

Reports give you access to your Platform data to benefit your organization's strategic business insights. With these reports, you can examine your Platform data in a variety of ways, display key metrics in easy-to-understand formats, and share the resulting insights. 

More information about XDM and [!DNL Experience Events] can be found in the [[!DNL XDM System] overview](../../xdm/home.md). By combining Query Service with [!DNL Experience Events], you can effectively track behavioral trends amongst your users. The following document provides examples of queries involving [!DNL Experience Events].

## Objectives

The following example creates a trended report of events over a specified date range, grouped by date. Specifically, this SQL example sums up various analytics values as `A`, `B`, and `C`, and then sums up the number of times parkas have been viewed over the period of a month.

The timestamp column found in [!DNL Experience Event] datasets is in UTC format. The example uses the `from_utc_timestamp()` function to transform the timestamp from UTC to EDT and then uses the `date_format()` function to isolate the date from the rest of the timestamp.

```sql
SELECT 
date_format( from_utc_timestamp(timestamp, 'EDT') , 'yyyy-MM-dd') as Day,
SUM(web.webPageDetails.pageviews.value) as pageViews,
SUM(_experience.analytics.event1to100.event1.value) as A,
SUM(_experience.analytics.event1to100.event2.value) as B,
SUM(_experience.analytics.event1to100.event3.value) as C,
SUM(
    CASE 
    WHEN _experience.analytics.customDimensions.evars.evar1 = 'parkas' 
    THEN 1 
    ELSE 0 
    END) as viewedParkas
FROM your_analytics_table 
WHERE TIMESTAMP >= to_timestamp('2019-03-01') AND TIMESTAMP <= to_timestamp('2019-03-31')
GROUP BY Day 
ORDER BY Day ASC, pageViews DESC;
```

The results of this query can be seen below.

```console
     Day     | pageViews |   A    |   B   |    C    | viewedParkas
