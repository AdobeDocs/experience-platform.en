# Analytics insights for web and mobile interactions

Adobe Experience Platform allows you to ingest data from Adobe Analytics report suites using Experience Data Model (XDM) fields to populate datasets. Query Service can then make use of this analytics data by running SQL queries to generate valuable insights from a users behavior over the digital platforms.

This document provides a variety of sample SQL queries to demonstrate common use cases for Analytics data when creating insights for web and mobile customer actions. 

See the [Analytics field mappings documentation](../../sources/connectors/adobe-applications/mapping/analytics.md) for more information on ingesting and mapping analytics data.
