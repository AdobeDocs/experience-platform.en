# Explore, troubleshoot, and verify batch ingestion with SQL

This document explains how to verify and validate records in ingested batches with SQL. This document teaches you how to: 

- Handle errors that may arise during the ingestion process
- Access dataset batch metadata
- Troubleshoot and ensure data integrity by querying batches

## Prerequisites

To help your understanding of the concepts discussed in this document, you should have knowledge of the following topics:

- **Data ingestion**: See the [data ingestion overview](../../ingestion/home.md) to learn the basics of how data is ingested into the Platform, including the different methods and processes involved.
- **Batch ingestion**: See the [batch ingestion API overview](../../ingestion/batch-ingestion/overview.md) to learn the basic concepts of batch ingestion. Specifically, what a "batch" is and how it functions within Platform's data ingestion process.
- **Error handling in data ingestion**: Learn about the [different types of errors that can occur](../../ingestion/quality/error-diagnostics.md#retrieve-errors) during data ingestion and [how to handle them](../../ingestion/batch-ingestion/troubleshooting.md#what-if-a-batch-fails).
- **System metadata in datasets**: See the [Catalog Service overview](../../catalog/home.md) to learn how system metadata fields are used to track and query ingested data.
- **Experience Data Model (XDM)**: See the [schemas UI overview](../../xdm/ui/overview.md) and the ['basics of schema composition'](../../xdm/schema/composition.md) to learn about XDM schemas and how they represent and validate the structure and format of data ingested into Platform.

## Access dataset batch metadata {#access-dataset-batch-metadata}

To ensure that system columns (metadata columns) are included in the query results, use the SQL command `set drop_system_columns=false` in your Query Editor. This configures the behavior of your SQL query session. This input must be repeated if you start a new session.

Next, to view the system fields of the dataset, execute a SELECT all statement to display the results from the dataset, for example `select * from movie_data`. The results include two new columns on the right-hand side `_acp_system_metadata` and `_ACP_BATCHID`. The metadata columns `_acp_system_metadata` and `_ACP_BATCHID` help identify the logical and physical partitions of ingested data.

When data is ingested into Platform, it is assigned a logical partition based on the incoming data. This logical partition is represented by `_acp_system_metadata.sourceBatchId`. This ID helps to group and identify the data batches logically before they are processed and stored.

After the data is processed and ingested into the data lake, it is assigned a physical partition represented by `_ACP_BATCHID`. This ID reflects the actual storage partition in the data lake where the ingested data resides.

### Use SQL to understand logical and physical partitions {#understand-partitions}

To help understand how the data is grouped and distributed after ingestion, use the following query to count the number of distinct physical partitions (`_ACP_BATCHID`) for each logical partition (`_acp_system_metadata.sourceBatchId`).

```SQL
SELECT  _acp_system_metadata, COUNT(DISTINCT _ACP_BATCHID) FROM movie_data
GROUP BY _acp_system_metadata
```

The results of this query are shown in the image below. 

![The results of a query to show the number of distinct physical partitions for each logical partition.](../images/use-cases/logical-and-physical-partition-count.png)

These results demonstrate that the number of input batches does not necessarily match the number of output batches, as the system determines the most efficient way to batch and store the data in the data lake. 

The following example uses a different dataset to illustrate this point. 

>[!NOTE]
>
>If you want to try this example out, you can ingest the provided sample file ([`drug_checkout_data`](../images/use-cases/drug_checkout_data.zip)) into Platform and configure your schema mapping. 

The `drug_checkout_data` file is a deeply nested set of 35,000 records. Use the SQL statement `SELECT * FROM drug_orders;` to preview of the first set of records in the JSON-based `drug_orders` dataset. 

The image below shows a preview of the file and its records.

### Use SQL to generate insights on batch ingestion process {#sql-insights-on-batch-ingestion}

Use the SQL statement below to provide insights into how the data ingestion process has grouped and processed the input records into batches.

```sql
SELECT _acp_system_metadata,
       Count(DISTINCT _acp_batchid) AS numoutputbatches,
       Count(_acp_batchid)          AS recordcount
FROM   drug_orders
GROUP  BY _acp_system_metadata 
```

The query results are seen in the image below.

![A table showing the distribution of how input batches were mastered at a time with record counts.](../images/use-cases/distribution-of-input-batches.png)

The results demonstrate the efficiency and behavior of the data ingestion process. Although three input batches were created -- each containing 2000, 24000, and 9000 records -- when the records were combined and deduplicated, only one unique batch remained.

>[!NOTE]
>
>All the records that are visible within a dataset are the ones that were successfully ingested. A successful batch ingestion does not mean that all the records that were sent from the source input are present. You must check for data ingestion failures to find the batches/records that did not make it in. 

## Validate a batch with SQL {#validate-a-batch-with-SQL}

Next, validate and verify the records that have been ingested into the dataset with SQL. 

>[!TIP]
>
>To retrieve the batch ID and query records associated with that batch ID, you must first  create a batch within Platform. If you want to test the process yourself, you can ingest CSV data into Platform. Read the guide on how to [map a CSV file to an existing XDM schema using AI-generated recommendations](../../ingestion/tutorials/map-csv/recommendations.md). A [sample profile CSV file](../images/use-cases/sample-profiles.csv) is available here for your convenience.

Once you have ingested a batch, you must navigate to the [!UICONTROL Datasets activity tab] for the dataset you ingested data into. 

In the Experience Platform UI, select **[!UICONTROL Datasets]** in the left-navigation to open the [!UICONTROL Datasets] dashboard. Next, select the name of the dataset from the [!UICONTROL Browse] tab to access the [!UICONTROL Dataset activity] screen.

![The Platform UI Datasets dashboard with Datasets highlighted in left navigation.](../images/use-cases/datasets-workspace.png)

The [!UICONTROL Dataset activity] view appears. This view contains details of your selected dataset. It includes any ingested batches which are displayed in a table format. 

Select a batch from the list of available batches and copy the [!UICONTROL Batch ID] from the details panel on the right.

![The Experience Platform Datasets UI showing the ingested records with a batch ID highlighted.](../images/use-cases/batch-id.png)

Next, use the following query to retrieve all the records that were included in the dataset as part of that batch:

```sql
SELECT * FROM movie_data
WHERE  _acp_batchid='01H00BKCTCADYRFACAAKJTVQ8P' 
LIMIT 1;
```

The `_ACP_BATCHID` keyword is used to filter the [!UICONTROL Batch ID]. 

>[!TIP]
>
>The `LIMIT` clause is helpful if you want to restrict the number of rows displayed, but a filter condition is more desirable. 

When you execute this query in the Query Editor, the results are truncated to 100 rows. The Query Editor is designed for quick previews and investigation. To retrieve up to 50,000 rows, you can use a third-party tool like DBVisualizer or DBeaver.

## Next steps {#next-steps}

By reading this document, you learned the essentials of verifying and validating records in ingested batches as part of the data ingestion process. You also gained insights into accessing dataset batch metadata, understanding logical and physical partitions, and querying specific batches using SQL commands. This knowledge can help you ensure data integrity and optimize your data storage on Platform.

Next, you should practice data ingestion to apply the concepts learned. Ingest a sample dataset into Platform with either the provided sample files or your own data. If you have not done so already, read the tutorial on how to [ingest data into Adobe Experience Platform](../../ingestion/tutorials/ingest-batch-data.md).

Alternatively, you could learn how to [connect and verify Query Service with a variety of desktop client applications](../clients/overview.md) to enhance your data analysis capabilities.
