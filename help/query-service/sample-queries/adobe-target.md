# Sample queries for Adobe Target data

Data from Adobe Target is transformed into Experience Event XDM schema and ingested into Adobe Experience Platform as datasets for you. There are many use cases for Adobe Experience Platform Query Service with this data, and the following sample queries should work with your Adobe Target datasets.

In Experience Platform, the name of auto-created dataset is "Adobe Target Experience Events". When using this dataset with queries, you should use the name `adobe_target_experience_events`.

## High-level partial XDM field mapping

The following list shows the Target fields that map to their corresponding XDM fields.

>[!NOTE]
>
> The use of `[ ]` within the XDM field denotes an array.

- mboxName: `_experience.target.mboxname`
- Activity ID: `_experience.target.activities.activityID`
- Experience ID: `_experience.target.activities[].activityEvents[]._experience.target.activity.activityevent.context.experienceID`
- Segment ID: `_experience.target.activities[].activityEvents[].segmentEvents[].segmentID._id`
- Event Scope: `_experience.target.activities[].activityEvents[].eventScope` 
    - This field tracks new visitors and visits.
- Step ID: `_experience.target.activities[].activityEvents[]._experience.target.activity.activityevent.context.stepID` 
    - This field is a custom step ID for Adobe Campaign.
- Price Total: `commerce.order.priceTotal`

## Sample queries

The following queries show examples of commonly used queries with Adobe Target.

In the following examples, you will need to edit the SQL to fill in the expected parameters for your queries based on the dataset, variables, or timeframe you are interested in evaluating. Provide parameters wherever you see `{ }` in the SQL.

### Hourly activity counts for a given day

```sql
SELECT
  Hour,
  ActivityID,
  COUNT(ActivityID) AS Instances
FROM
(
  SELECT
    date_format(from_utc_timestamp(timestamp, 'America/New_York'), 'yyyy-MM-dd HH') AS Hour,
    EXPLODE(_experience.target.activities.activityID) AS ActivityID
  FROM adobe_target_experience_events
  WHERE TIMESTAMP = to_timestamp('{TARGET_YEAR}-{TARGET_MONTH}-{TARGET_DAY}') AND 
    _experience.target.activities IS NOT NULL
)
GROUP BY Hour, ActivityID
ORDER BY Hour DESC, Instances DESC
LIMIT 24
```

### Hourly details for a specific activity for a given day

```sql

  COUNT(ActivityID) AS Instances
FROM adobe_target_experience_events
WHERE
  array_contains( _experience.target.activities.activityID, {Activity ID} ) AND 
    TIMESTAMP = to_timestamp('{TARGET_YEAR}-{TARGET_MONTH}-{TARGET_DAY}') AND 
  _experience.target.activities IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY Hour, ActivityID
ORDER BY Hour DESC
