# Sample queries for [!DNL Experience Events]

In addition to standard SQL queries, Adobe Experience Platform [!DNL Query Service] supports writing queries using [!DNL Experience Events]. Experience Events are represented by the Experience Data Model (XDM) ExperienceEvent class, which captures an immutable and non-aggregated snapshot of the system when a user interacts with a website or service, and can therefore be used for time-domain analysis. 

More information about XDM and [!DNL Experience Events] can be found in the [[!DNL XDM System] overview](../../xdm/home.md). By combining [!DNL Query Service] with [!DNL Experience Events], you can effectively track behavioral trends amongst your users. The following document provides examples of queries involving [!DNL Experience Events].

## Creating a trended report of events by day over a specific date range

The following example creates a trended report of events over a specified date range, grouped by date. Specifically, it sums up various analytics values as A, B, and C, and then sums up the number of times parkas has been viewed.

The timestamp column found in [!DNL Experience Event] datasets is in UTC. The following example uses the `from_utc_timestamp()` function to transform the timestamp from UTC to EDT. It then uses the `date_format()` function to isolate the date from the rest of the timestamp.

```sql
SELECT 
date_format( from_utc_timestamp(timestamp, 'EDT') , 'yyyy-MM-dd') as Day,
SUM(web.webPageDetails.pageviews.value) as pageViews,
SUM(_experience.analytics.event1to100.event1.value) as A,
SUM(_experience.analytics.event1to100.event2.value) as B,
SUM(_experience.analytics.event1to100.event3.value) as C,
SUM(
    CASE 
    WHEN _experience.analytics.customDimensions.evars.evar1 = 'parkas' 
    THEN 1 
    ELSE 0 
    END) as viewedParkas
FROM your_analytics_table 
WHERE TIMESTAMP >= to_timestamp('2019-03-01') AND TIMESTAMP <= to_timestamp('2019-03-31')
GROUP BY Day 
ORDER BY Day ASC, pageViews DESC;
```

```console
     Day     | pageViews |   A    |   B   |    C    | viewedParkas

## Retrieving a list of visitors organized by number of page views.

The following example creates a report that lists the IDs of the users who have viewed the most pages.

```sql
SELECT 
endUserIds._experience.aaid.id, 
SUM(web.webPageDetails.pageviews.value) as pageViews 
FROM your_analytics_table
GROUP BY endUserIds._experience.aaid.id 
ORDER BY pageViews DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

```console
               id                  | pageViews
-----------------------------------+-----------

## Replaying a visitor's sessions

The following example lists the last 100 pages that a specified user has viewed.


```sql
SELECT 
timestamp, 
web.webReferrer.type as referrerType, 
web.webReferrer.URL as referrer, 
web.webPageDetails.name as pageName,

## Viewing a rollup report of a visitor

The following example shows an aggregate report of various analytics values for a specified user.

```sql
SELECT 
endUserIds._experience.aaid.id, 
SUM(web.webPageDetails.pageviews.value) as pageViews, 
SUM(_experience.analytics.event1to100.event1.value) as A, 
SUM(_experience.analytics.event1to100.event2.value) as B, 
SUM(_experience.analytics.event1to100.event3.value) as C,
SUM(
    CASE 
    WHEN _experience.analytics.customDimensions.evars.evar1 = 'parkas' 
    THEN 1 
    ELSE 0 
    END) as viewedParkas
FROM your_analytics_table

GROUP BY endUserIds._experience.aaid.id
ORDER BY pageViews DESC;
```

```console
