# Getting started with Adobe Experience Platform [!DNL Query Service] {#getting-started}

Once your organization is provisioned for Adobe Experience Platform, your administrator can grant you access to [!DNL Query Service]. Before you can make use of all features offered by [!DNL Query Service], however, you must first ingest data into Adobe Experience Platform. 

This [data ingestion tutorial video](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/platform-learn/tutorials/data-ingestion/create-datasets-and-ingest-data.html) provides an overview on creating a dataset, mapping a dataset to a schema, adding data to the dataset, and confirming its ingestion. The [ingestion overview documentation](../../ingestion/home.md) supplements this and provides more in depth information and links to other learning resources.

After you have ingested your data into Adobe Experience Platform, you can begin working with [!DNL Query Service] using either the [[!DNL Query Editor] in the Platform UI](ui/user-guide.md) or the [[!DNL Query Service] API](../api/getting-started.md). Full documentation on how to use each of these tools can be found within their respective sections.
