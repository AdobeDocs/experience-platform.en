# Getting started with Query Service

This document provides a high-level end-to-end workflow for getting started with Adobe Experience Platform Query Service, through an example use case to illustrate key concepts.

Query service is great because: ... and it does ... computes attributes to segment and personalize messages. Constraints can be included in your queries to simplify your segment building process. 

<!-- [Benefits of QS] -->

## Example use case

This tutorial workflow relies on several Adobe Experience Platform services as part of the demonstration. If you want to follow along it is recommended to have a good understanding of the following services:

- [Create datasets and ingest data](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/platform-learn/tutorials/data-ingestion/create-datasets-and-ingest-data.html)
- [Segmentation](../../segmentation/home.md)
- [Destinations](../../destinations/home.md)

Once your organization is provisioned for Adobe Experience Platform, your administrator can grant you access to [!DNL Query Service].

1. If you haven't already ingested your data into Adobe Experience Platform, then that is where you should start. Refer to the data ingestion documentation.
1. After you have ingested your data into Adobe Experience Platform, you can begin working with [!DNL Query Service] using [Platform UI](ui/overview.md). For example, you can use Adobe Experience Platform's browser-based [[!DNL Query Editor]](ui/user-guide.md) to write, validate, and run queries.


[!DNL Query Service] also provides a way to connect external tools to issue queries. For instructions on connecting a tool such as a Business Intelligence tool or a command line interface, please read [connect a tool](clients/overview.md).
