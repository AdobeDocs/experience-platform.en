# Connect [!DNL RStudio] to Query Service

This document walks through the steps for connecting [!DNL RStudio] with Adobe Experience Platform [!DNL Query Service].

>[!NOTE]
>
> This guide assumes you already have access to [!DNL RStudio] and are familiar with how to use it. More information about [!DNL RStudio] can be found in the [official [!DNL RStudio] documentation](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/).
> 
> Additionally, to use RStudio with Query Service, you need to install the PostgreSQL JDBC 4.2 Driver. You can download the JDBC Driver from the [PostgreSQL official site](https://jdbc.postgresql.org/download.html).

## Create a [!DNL Query Service] connection in the [!DNL RStudio] interface

After installing [!DNL RStudio], you need to install the RJDBC package. Go to the **[!DNL Packages]** pane, and select **[!DNL Install]**. 

![](../images/clients/rstudio/install-package.png)

A pop up appears, showing the **[!DNL Install Packages]** screen. Ensure that **[!DNL Repository (CRAN)]** is selected for the **[!DNL Install from]** section. The value for **[!DNL Packages]** should be `RJDBC`. Ensure **[!DNL Install dependencies]** is selected. After confirming all the values are correct, select **[!DNL Install]** to install the packages.

Now that the RJDBC package has been installed, restart RStudio to complete the installation process.

After RStudio has restarted, you can now connect to Query Service. Select the **[!DNL RJDBC]** package in the **[!DNL Packages]** pane, and enter the following command in the console:

```console
pgsql <- JDBC("org.postgresql.Driver", "{PATH TO THE POSTGRESQL JDBC JAR}", "`")
```

Where {PATH TO THE POSTGRESQL JDBC JAR} represents the path to the PostgreSQL JDBC JAR that was installed on your computer.

Now, you can create your connection to Query Service by entering the following command in the console:

```console
qsconnection <- dbConnect(pgsql, "jdbc:postgresql://{HOSTNAME}:{PORT}/{DATABASE_NAME}?user={USERNAME}&password={PASSWORD}&sslmode=require")
```

>[!NOTE]
>
>For more information on finding your database name, host, port, and login credentials, please read the [credentials guide](../ui/credentials.md). To find your credentials, log in to [!DNL Platform], then select **[!UICONTROL Queries]**, followed by **[!UICONTROL Credentials]**.

## Writing queries

Now that you have connected to [!DNL Query Service], you can write queries to execute and edit SQL statements. For example, you can use `dbGetQuery(con, sql)` to execute queries, where `sql` is the SQL query you want to run.

The following query uses a dataset containing [Experience Events](../best-practices/experience-event-queries.md) and creates a histogram of page views of a website, given the device's screen height.

```sql
df_pageviews <- dbGetQuery(con,
"SELECT t.range AS buckets, 
 Count(*) AS pageviews 
FROM (SELECT CASE 
 WHEN device.screenheight BETWEEN 0 AND 99 THEN '0 - 99' 
 WHEN device.screenheight BETWEEN 100 AND 199 THEN '100-199' 
 WHEN device.screenheight BETWEEN 200 AND 299 THEN '200-299' 
 WHEN device.screenheight BETWEEN 300 AND 399 THEN '300-399' 
 WHEN device.screenheight BETWEEN 400 AND 499 THEN '400-499' 
 WHEN device.screenheight BETWEEN 500 AND 599 THEN '500-599' 
 ELSE '600-699' 
 end AS range 
 FROM aa_post_vals_3) t 
GROUP BY t.range 
ORDER BY buckets 
LIMIT 1000000")
```

A successful response returns the results of the query: 

```r
df_pageviews
 buckets pageviews
1 0 - 99 198985
2 500-599 67138
3 300-399 2147
4 200-299 354
5 400-499 6947
6 100-199 4415
7 600-699 3097040
```
