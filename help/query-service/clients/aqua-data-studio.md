# Connect [!DNL Aqua Data Studio] to Query Service

This document covers the steps for connecting [!DNL Aqua Data Studio] with Adobe Experience Platform [!DNL Query Service].

## Getting started

This guide requires you to already have access to [!DNL Aqua Data Studio] and be familiar with how to navigate its interface. More information about [!DNL Aqua Data Studio] can be found in the [official [!DNL Aqua Data Studio] documentation](https://www.aquaclusters.com/app/home/project/public/aquadatastudio/wikibook/Documentation21.1/page/0/Aqua-Data-Studio-21-1).

>[!NOTE]
>
>There are [!DNL Windows] and [!DNL macOS] versions of [!DNL Aqua Data Studio]. Screenshots in this guide were taken using the [!DNL macOS] desktop app. There may be minor discrepancies in the UI between the versions.

To acquire the necessary credentials for connecting [!DNL Aqua Data Studio] to Experience Platform, you must have access to the [!UICONTROL Queries] workspace in the Platform UI. Please contact your IMS Organization administrator if you do not currently have access to the [!UICONTROL Queries] workspace.

- **[!DNL Host and Port]**: The host endpoint and its port for [!DNL Query Service]. You must use port 80 to connect with [!DNL Query Service].

### [!DNL Query Service] credentials

To find your credentials, log in to the [!DNL Platform] UI and select **[!UICONTROL Queries]** from the left navigation, followed by **[!UICONTROL Credentials]**. For complete directions to find your login credentials, host, port, and database name, please read the [credentials guide](../ui/credentials.md).

[!DNL Query Service] also offers non-expiring credentials to allow for a one-time setup with third-party clients. See the documentation for [full instructions on how to generate and use non-expiring credentials](../ui/credentials.md#non-expiring-credentials).

You can now connect to the server and view its schema objects.
