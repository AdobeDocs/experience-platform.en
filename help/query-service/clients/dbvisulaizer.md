# Connect [!DNL DbVisualizer] to [!DNL Query Service] {#connect-dbvisualizer}

This document covers the steps for connecting the [!DNL DbVisualizer] database tool with Adobe Experience Platform [!DNL Query Service].

## Getting started

This guide requires that you already have access to the [!DNL DbVisualizer] desktop app and are familiar with how to navigate its interface. To download the [!DNL DbVisualizer] desktop app or for more information, see the [official [!DNL DbVisualizer] documentation](https://www.dbvis.com/download/).

>[!NOTE]
>
>There are [!DNL Windows], [!DNL macOS], and [!DNL Linux] versions of [!DNL DbVisualizer]. Screenshots in this guide were taken using the [!DNL macOS] desktop app. There may be minor discrepancies in the UI between the versions.

To acquire the necessary credentials for connecting [!DNL  DbVisualizer] to Experience Platform, you must have access to the Queries workspace in the Platform UI. Please contact your IMS Organization administrator if you do not currently have access to the Queries workspace. 

## Create a database connection {#connect-database}

Once you have installed the desktop app on your local machine, start the app and select **[!DNL Create a Database Connection]** from the initial [!DNL DbVisualizer] menu. Then select **[!DNL Create a Connection]** in the panel to the right.

Use the search bar or select [!DNL PostgreSQL] from the driver name dropdown list. The Database Connection workspace appears.

From the Database Connection workspace, select the **[!DNL Properties]** tab, followed by the **[!DNL Driver Properties]** from the navigation sidebar.

![The Database Connection workspace with the properties tab highlighted.](../images/clients/dbvisualizer/driver-properties.png)

The three required driver properties are seen in the table below. 

| Property | Description|
| ------ | ------ |
| `PGHOST` | The host name for the [!DNL PostgreSQL] server. This value is your Experience Platform [!UICONTROL Host] credential. |
| `SSL` | This controls the use of SSL requirements. You **must** use the value "1" to enable this requirement. |
| `user` | The username connected to the database is your Organization ID. It is an alphanumeric string ending in `@adobe.org` |

### [!DNL Query Service] credentials

The `PGHOST` and `user` values are taken from your Adobe Experience Platform credentials. To find your credentials, log in to the Platform UI and select **[!UICONTROL Queries]** from the left navigation, followed by **[!UICONTROL Credentials]**. For more information on finding your database name, host, port, and login credentials, please read the [credentials guide](../ui/credentials.md).

[!DNL Query Service] also offers non-expiring credentials to allow for a one-time setup with third-party clients. See the documentation for [full instructions on how to generate and use non-expiring credentials](../ui/credentials.md#non-expiring-credentials).

Use the search bar to find each property then select the corresponding cell for the parameter's value. The cell will highlight in blue. Enter your Platform credential in the value field and select **[!DNL Apply]** to add the driver property.

>[!NOTE]
>
>To add a second `user` profile, select `user` from the parameter column then select the blue + (plus) icon to add credentials for each user. Select **[!DNL Apply]** to add the driver property.

The [!DNL Edited] column shows a checkmark to denote that the parameter value has been updated.

## Authentication

To require a user ID and password-based authentication each time a connection is established, select **[!DNL Authentication]** from the navigation sidebar under [!DNL PostgreSQL].

In the Connection Authentication panel, check both the **[!DNL Require Userid]** and **[!DNL Require Password]** checkboxes then select **[!DNL Apply]**.

## Connect to Platform

To make a connection, select the **[!DNL Connection]** tab from the Database Connection workspace and enter your Experience Platform credentials for the following settings.

- **Name**: You are recommended to provide a friendly name to recognize the connection. 
- **Database Server**: This is your Experience Platform [!UICONTROL Host] credential. 
- **Database Port**: The port for [!DNL Query Service]. You must use port 80 to connect with [!DNL Query Service].
- **Database**: Use the credential `dbname` value `prod:all`.
- **Database Userid**: This is your Platform Organization Id. The Userid will be in the format of `ORG_ID@AdobeOrg`. 
- **Database Password**: This is an alphanumeric string found on the [!DNL Query Service] credentials dashboard.

After you have input all relevant credentials, select **[!DNL Connect]**.

The [!DNL Connect] dialog appears on the first occasion of the session. 

![The Connect dialog with the database userid and database password text fields are highlighted.](../images/clients/dbvisualizer/connect-dialog.png)

Enter your Userid and Password and select **[!DNL Connect]**. A message appears in the log to confirm a successful connection.

## Next steps

Now that you have connected [!DNL DbVisualizer] with [!DNL Query Service], you can use [!DNL DbVisualizer] to write queries. For more information on how to write and run queries, please read the [guide on query execution](../best-practices/writing-queries.md).
