# Connect [!DNL Power BI] to Query Service (PC)

This document covers the steps for connecting Power BI with Adobe Experience Platform Query Service.

>[!NOTE]
>
> This guide assumes you already have access to [!DNL Power BI] and are familiar with how to navigate its interface. More information about [!DNL Power BI] can be found in the [official [!DNL Power BI] documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/power-bi/).
>
> Additionally, Power BI is **only** available on Windows devices.

After installing Power BI, you will need to install `Npgsql`, a .NET driver package for PostgreSQL. More information about Npgsql can be found in the [Npgsql documentation](https://www.npgsql.org/doc/index.html).

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>You must download v4.0.10 or lower, as newer versions result in errors.

Under "[!DNL Npgsql GAC Installation]" on the custom setup screen, select **[!DNL Will be installed on local hard drive]**. 

To ensure that npgsql has properly installed, please restart your computer before proceeding to the next steps.

## Connect [!DNL Power BI] to [!DNL Query Service]

To connect [!DNL Power BI] to [!DNL Query Service], open [!DNL Power BI] and select **[!DNL Get Data]** in the top menu ribbon.

You can now enter values for the server and database. For more information on finding your database name, host, port, and login credentials, please read the [credentials guide](../ui/credentials.md). To find your credentials, log in to [!DNL Platform], then select **[!UICONTROL Queries]**, followed by **[!UICONTROL Credentials]**.

**[!DNL Server]** is the host found under the connection details. For production, add port `:80` to the end of the host string. **[!DNL Database]** can be either "all" or a dataset table name. 

Additionally, you can select your **[!DNL Data Connectivity mode]**. Select **[!DNL Import]** to display a list of all available tables, or select **[!DNL DirectQuery]** to directly create a query. 

To learn more about **[!DNL Import]** mode, please read the section on [previewing and importing a table](#preview). To learn more about **[!DNL DirectQuery]** mode, please read the section on [creating SQL statements](#create). Select **[!DNL OK]** after confirming your database details.

## Create SQL statements {#create}

If you've selected **[!DNL DirectQuery]** mode, you will need to fill out the Advanced options section with the SQL query you want to create.
