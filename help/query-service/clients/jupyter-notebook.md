# Connect Jupyter Notebook to Query Service

This document covers the steps for connecting Jupyter Notebook with Adobe Experience Platform Query Service.

## Getting started

This guide requires that you already have access to Jupyter Notebook and are familiar with how to navigate its interface. To download Jupyter Notebook or for more information, see the [official Jupyter Notebook documentation](https://jupyter.org/).

To acquire the necessary credentials for connecting Jupyter Notebook to Experience Platform, you must have access to the Queries workspace in the Platform UI. Please contact your IMS Organization administrator if you do not currently have access to the Queries workspace.
