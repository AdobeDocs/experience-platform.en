## Phrasing your questions {#phrasing-your-questions}

You must phrase your questions to AI Assistant with clarity and context in order to get as accurate a response as a possible. Refer to the following list of tips for guidance on how to ask a clear question with context:

* State your task and/or question in a concise manner.
* Avoid ambiguous language or overly complex syntax to facilitate comprehension.
* Provide relevant context regarding your task and/or question as context can help AI Assistant generate more relevant responses.

Read the tables below for further guidance on best practices to follow when asking questions to AI Assistant.

The following tables outline best practices you can follow when using AI Assistant:

| Do | Example |
| --- | --- |
| <ul><li>Be specific about the object or information that you want to retrieve or analyze.</li><li>Try placing your data object names in quotes. If you only know a part of the object name, you may also specify that in the question.</li><li>Use [object auto-complete](./ui-guide.md#use-auto-complete) to help AI Assistant better understand the context of your query.</li></ul> | <ul><li>Which datasets use the "Luma - Loyalty" schema?</li><li>Show me the activated segments which have "Luma" in their names. Rank them by profile count.</li></ul> |
| <ul><li>Avoid ambiguity and use clear language</li><li>Use precise terminology to ensure better clarity in your query.</li><li>When asking questions regarding Adobe Experience Platform, try to use terminology specific to Experience Platform to improve relevance of responses.</li></ul> | <ul><li>How many profiles do I have in "ACME Audience".</li><li>Show me the top 5 XDM attributes used in activated audiences.</li></ul> |
| <ul><li>Provide context or specify a criteria to filter your results.</li><li>Use a filter criteria in the questions to limit the volume of data in the response.</li></ul> | <ul><li>Show me audiences that have not been activated and were created more than 6 months ago and have never been modified.</li><li>Show me audiences activated to "ACME Destination" and have more than 10000 profiles.</li></ul> |

{style="table-layout:auto"}

| Don't | Example |
| --- | --- |
| Use vague or ambiguous language. | <ul><li>Give me information about datasets.</li><li>How many users do I have in "ACME Audience"?</li><li>Show segments.</li><li>List attributes.</li></ul>|
| Make incomplete requests. | "Luma - Loyalty Dataset" |
| Assume knowledge without contexts. | <ul><li>Audiences in the last 6 months.</li><li>Build a query for me.</li></ul>|
| Formulate overly complex queries. | Provide a comprehensive analysis of data lineage across all objects and their dependencies. |
| Omit criteria or parameters. | Show me datasets. |

## Examples of unsupported questions {#unsupported-questions}

The following is a list of examples of questions that are currently not supported by AI Assistant.

+++Select to view examples of unsupported questions

### Operational insights

* How many profiles in this sandbox live in California? (**Note**: for similar questions, you must provide a specific criteria to give enough context for your request, in this case, the specific criteria is "live in California").
* What are the segments this profile {PROFILE_INFO/ATTRIBUTE_VALUE} is in?
* How many profiles in the dataset have an email?
* Which dataset constitutes to maximum number of profiles in this sandbox ?
* Which dataset has the highest number of records?
* How many segments have been deleted in {RELATIVE_DATE}?
* Which of my datasets has the largest size?
* Give me a profile in the {AUDIENCE_NAME}. 
* What is the total number of profiles in my sandbox
* How many identity namespaces are associated with the audience {AUDIENCE_NAME}?
* Show me a report of all the audience segments that were evaluated today
* How many segments have overlapping profiles?
* How many batches are being loaded into {DATASET_NAME}
* How many active offers do I have?
* How many active campaigns do I have?
* Where are my sources of data coming from?
* What is the biggest dataset or data source?
* Can I get the list of users who have created these schemas?

### Troubleshooting

* Why is this batch {BATCH_NAME/BATCH_ID} still processing?
* Why is no one qualifying for this audience {AUDIENCE_NAME}?
* I am not able to see Customer AI, why and how do I fix it?
* I am not able to see Dataset preview, why and how do I fix it?
* Why can't I delete {SEGMENT/DATASET/SCHEMA_NAME}?
* Do I have access to Query Service?

### Task and automation

* Write a query that gives me one record from the {DATASET_NAME}.
* Write a sample API call to /schemas/{schemaId}/fields/{fieldPath}/values.
* Set up a source/destination for me. 
* Create an audience for me with criteria {USER_SPECIFIC_CRITERIA}.
