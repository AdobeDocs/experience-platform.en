>This feature is in Alpha and may not be available to your organization. To participate in the Alpha program and access this feature, contact your Adobe Account Team.

You can use AI Assistant in Adobe Experience Platform to streamline customer support process by accelerating troubleshooting and ticket creation, while also providing real-time issue tracking.

AI Assistant can now help you answer common troubleshooting questions using specialized and expertly-curated knowledge in new documentation sources. If you still require creating a case with Adobe Support, you can ask AI Assistant to "create a support ticket" with all the context from your chat preserved for faster remediation.

## Use AI Assistant to troubleshoot and create customer support tickets

>[!BEGINSHADEBOX]

**Example customer scenario**

Your company is trying to launch a new streaming onboarding campaign for new users for the holidays and are expecting thousands of sign ups per day. However, you notice that the newly created onboarding journey is not being triggered as expected.

First, you must diagnose and attempt to troubleshoot the issue with AI Assistant. Read the following for an example of a step-by-step troubleshooting interaction with AI Assistant:

1. Navigate to the Experience Platform UI and access AI Assistant.
2. Submit the following question to AI Assistant: "Why is my new journey not being triggered?
3. AI Assistant assesses the question and returns a list of common reasons why a journey may not get triggered, including a reference to the customer journey in question.
4. Next, you will receive a list of the best possible resolutions that you can take in order to troubleshoot the issues, some of which may include:
  a. The expected references to the underlying segment.
  b. Any changes that have been processed for the journey or the segment definition.
  c. The status of the streaming segmentation job.
5. Suppose that the issue stems from streaming segmentation not running as expected and submit a new question to AI Assistant: "Why has my streaming segmentation not run?"
6. AI Assistant queries internal tools and identifies that streaming segmentation has been turned off due to a guardrail breach. AI Assistant indicates that audiences from Customer Journey Analytics and Adobe Analytics are contributing to a spike in streaming audiences, and thus leading to streaming segmentation being turned off.

At this point, AI Assistant prompts you with the option to create a customer support ticket to re-enable streaming segmentation. Alternatively, you may also submit the following command to AI Assistant: "Create a customer support ticket."

During this process, AI Assistant will initiate a new customer ticket, using your previous interaction to generate a title and description for the new ticket. 

You will have the opportunity to review and edit any aspects of the ticket, including the AI-generated content that it's populated with. Additionally, you can use this step to provide or upload additional information, such as screenshots of your UI that may be aid customer support in better understanding your challenges.

AI Assistant also includes your chat history and session details to the newly created customer support ticket. You may also configure the priority of the ticket prior to saving and finalizing it. Ensure that you retain your ticket number because you can reference this ticket number against AI Assistant to monitor the status of your ticket. -->
