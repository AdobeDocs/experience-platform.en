# Send-Time Optimization Model Details

## Model overview {#model-overview}

* **Model name and version**: Send-Time Optimization
* **Model release date**: September 2024
* **Model purpose**: Adobe Journey Optimizer's Send-Time Optimization model chooses the optimal send time for email and push messages to maximize consumer engagement, based on your consumers' historical open and click behavior.
* **Intended users**: The primary users of this model are marketing professionals, product managers, and customer engagement teams who leverage Adobe Journey Optimizer to drive data-driven marketing strategies.
* **Use cases**: Send-Time Optimization is best used on less-urgent marketing communications – for example, a weekly ad, promotional information on a new product, or information about a month-long sale. Send-Time Optimization is only available for Journey Optimizer's built-in Email and Push action types and is not currently available for messages sent through custom actions or for other action types.
* **Potential misuse**: Send-Time Optimization should not be used for urgent, time-sensitive operational messages – for example, an order confirmation, a password reset notification, or a flight gate change notification.

## Model details {#model-details}

* **Model type**: The Send-Time Optimization model ingests your organization's Adobe Journey Optimizer consumer behavior data and looks at user-level open and click events to predict when your consumers are most likely to engage with your messaging. Consumer-level open and click behavior for each hour of the week are weighted and combined with lookalike and overall consumer behavior using a [!DNL Bayesian] estimator. The [!DNL Bayesian] predictions for each hour of the week are then ranked, resulting in a "heat map" for each metric (email opens, email clicks, and push opens), for each customer, to predict the hours of the week that contacting each consumer is most and least likely to result in the desired engagement outcome.
* **Input**: Send-Time Optimization utilizes consumer timezone data in the `timeZone` field within the [!UICONTROL Preference Details] field group, if provided, to determine a consumer's timezone. If a consumer's timezone is not available in the `timeZone` field, Send-Time Optimization attempts to infer the consumer's timezone, based on the most common timezone match to the first postal address found stored in the consumer's profile using the [postal address data type](../../../xdm/data-types/postal-address.md). Send-Time Optimization makes predictions for each consumer based on three types of behavioral data:
  * The open and click behavior of your consumers overall.
  * The open and click behavior of lookalike consumers in the same time zone.
  * The open and click behavior of that individual consumer.
* **Output**: These predictions are weighted and combined using a [!DNL Bayesian] approach, resulting in a "heat map" for each metric (email opens, email clicks, and push opens), for each customer, that indicates the hours of the week that contacting that consumer is most and least likely to result in the desired engagement outcome (open/click), as illustrated in the below example heatmap:

* **Example input and output**: In order to minimize the model's impact on profile richness, model scores are stored and compressed in three Profile attributes stored in `_experience.intelligentServices.journeyAI.sendTimeOptimization`, and are not designed to be human readable.

## Model training {#model-training}

* **Training data and preprocessing**: The training dataset for each organization is sourced only from their own data within Adobe Experience Platform.
  * Once the Send-Time Optimization feature is enabled for your organization, the model is trained on email and push, send, open, and click events across all your organization's journeys and actions over the last 16 weeks – regardless of whether those actions use Send-Time Optimization. This allows Send-Time Optimization to benefit from all data generated by your consumers.
  * Models are initially trained and scored weekly. After 16 weeks, models are retrained and rescored monthly. Model scoring includes all customer profiles – both existing and new - since the last scoring run.
  * Messages sent by Send-Time Optimization receive either of the following:
    * An "exploration" message send time, selected to test different send times and observe how consumers respond.
    * An "optimized" message send time, selected to maximize click/open rates. 5% of send events receive an "exploration" send time and 95% of send events are "optimized".
  * Exploration send times are selected at random from the send times made available by your configured maximum wait time. For example, in the case that a message is selected at 9 AM Wednesday with Send-Time Optimization turned on and a 3-hour maximum wait time, Exploration send times for the message will be split evenly between 9 AM, 10 AM, 11 AM and 12 PM.

## Model evaluation {#model-evaluation}

* **Model evaluation**: Send-Time Optimization may increase email click rate and push open rate in the range of approximately 2% to 10% across all messages optimized by an organization.
  * For example, if an organization sending emails without send time optimization has a 5.0% click rate on average, the same set of emails with send time optimization might result in as much as a 5.5% click rate on average (5.0% * (1+10%) = 5.5%).
  * Due to variability within small sample sizes, a benefit from Send-Time Optimization may not be observable on single message sends.
  * Organizations are more likely to experience greater benefits from using Send-Time Optimization when:
    * Existing journeys use send times that are fixed and not well-optimized;
    * Variability in consumer behavior (clicks and opens) corresponds to consumer location and consumer preferences;
    * Organizations use Send-Time Optimization on a larger fraction of email & push messages;
    * Organizations choose maximum wait times within the recommended range of 6-12 hours.

## Model deployment {#model-deployment}

* **Model update**: Models are initially trained and scored weekly. After 16 weeks, models are retrained and rescored monthly. Model scoring includes all consumer profiles – both existing and new since the last scoring run.

## Fairness and bias {#fairness-and-bias}

* **Model fairness**: Incorrect inference of a consumer's timezone may result in a message being sent earlier than optimal for a given consumer or later than optimal for a given consumer. However, all consumers in a communication utilizing Send-Time Optimization will ultimately receive a message and have the opportunity to interact with a message. Additionally, this model does not utilize consumer demographic data or proxies for demographic data – only consumer behavioral and consumer timezone data are utilized. Therefore, fairness concerns are limited and mitigated.
* **Data biases**: Incorrect inference of a consumer's timezone may result in a message being sent earlier than optimal for a given consumer or later than optimal for a given consumer. However, all consumers in a communication utilizing Send-Time Optimization will ultimately receive a message and have the opportunity to interact with a message. Additionally, this model does not utilize consumer demographic data or proxies for demographic data – only consumer behavioral and consumer timezone data are utilized. Therefore, bias concerns are limited and mitigated.

## Robustness {#robustness}

* **Model robustness**: Profiles without sufficient interaction event data (often the case for new profiles) will receive either an immediate send time, an exploration send time within the selected window, or a send time based on the highest-performing send time across all customers.

## Ethical considerations {#ethical-considerations}

* **Ethical considerations associated with the model**: Incorrect inference of a consumer's timezone may result in a message being sent earlier than optimal for a given consumer or later than optimal for a given consumer. However, all consumers in a communication utilizing Send-Time Optimization will ultimately receive a message and have the opportunity to interact with a message. Additionally, this model does not utilize consumer demographic data or proxies for demographic data – only consumer behavioral and consumer timezone data are utilized. Therefore, ethical concerns are limited and mitigated.
