Read this document for a guide on model cards in Adobe Experience Platform.

## Model card sections {#sections}

Read the following for a guide on the many different sections of a model card, including information the questions they address.

### Model Overview {#model-overview}

| Question | Information needed | Example answer |
| --- | --- | --- |
| What is the name of the model? | The official name and version of the AI model | **CustomerAI Propensity Scoring Model v2.0** <br>CustomerAI is an AI-powered model designed to generate propensity scores for users based on their past behaviors and interactions with a business. It helps predict the likelihood of a customer taking specific actions, such as making a purchase, engaging with content, or churning. This model is deployed within Adobe Experience Platform and integrates with various marketing and customer analytics workflows.</br> |
| What is the purpose of the model? | A brief description of what the model is designed to do. | The model is designed to provide marketers and customer engagement teams with actionable insights by predicting the probability that a customer will perform a given action, such as making a purchase, signing up for a subscription, or engaging with an email campaign. The outputs allow businesses to optimize audience segmentation and personalize customer interactions based on predicted behaviors. |
| What type of model is it? | Classification, regression, generative, etc. | This is a s**upervised learning classification model** that predicts the probability of an event occurring (e.g., purchase, churn, engagement) given historical customer data. It is trained using gradient boosting decision trees (GBDT) with logistic regression to model propensity scores. |
| Who are the intended users? | Internal and external user groups. | The primary users of this model are marketing professionals, data analysts, and customer engagement teams who leverage Adobe Experience Platform to drive data-driven marketing strategies. |
| How does this model integrate with Adobe Experience Platform? | Integration details, APIs used, and how it fits into workflows. | CustomerAI integrates directly into **Adobe Experience Platform's AI services**, allowing users to access model outputs through pre-built APIs and dashboards. The propensity scores generated by the model can be used within **Adobe Journey Optimizer**, **and Adobe Real-Time CDP**, to refine audience segmentation and tailor marketing strategies. |

### Intended Use

| Question | Information needed | Example answer |
| --- | --- | --- |
| What are the primary use cases? | Scenarios where the model is expected to be used. | This model is primarily used for **customer segmentation, targeted marketing, and churn prediction**. Businesses leverage this model to **predict customer purchase intent, optimize marketing campaigns, and enhance personalization efforts**. For example, an e-commerce company might use the model to identify high-intent shoppers and offer them exclusive promotions. |
| What problems does this model solve? | Key pain points addressed by the model. | Marketers often struggle with **identifying the right customers to target** and **optimizing engagement efforts**. This model **reduces guesswork** by providing a **data-driven approach** to customer targeting, ensuring that marketing resources are allocated efficiently. |
| What industries or domains are this model relevant for? | List of applicable industries. | The model is applicable across multiple industries, including **e-commerce, retail, financial services, telecommunications, and media**. Any business that relies on customer engagement and personalized marketing can benefit from this model. |
| How should this model not be used? | Misuse cases that should be avoided. | The model **should not be used for high-risk decision-making**, such as **financial credit scoring, medical diagnostics, or legal assessments**. Additionally, it is not intended for use in **predicting personally sensitive behaviors** (such as, health conditions, political preferences) due to potential ethical concerns. |

### Model Inputs and Outputs

| Question | Information needed | Example answer |
| --- | --- | --- |
| What types of data does the model take as input? | Data features, formats, and sources. | The model processes **customer behavioral data, demographic attributes, and historical interactions**. This includes data such as website visit frequency, past purchase history, engagement with marketing emails, and demographic information. |
| What format should the inputs be in? | Accepted input formats. | Input data must be structured as **JSON objects** containing customer attributes and behavioral signals. For batch processing, the model accepts **CSV files** formatted according to Adobe Experience Platform's data ingestion standards. |
| What does the model output? | Type of output generated by the model. | The model outputs a propensity score between 0 and 1, where higher values indicate a higher likelihood of the predicted event occurring. Additionally, it provides feature importance scores, allowing users to understand which factors influenced the prediction. |
| What are some example inputs and outputs? | A sample input and corresponding output. | <ul><li>**Example Input:** json { "customer_id": 12345, "past_purchases": 3, "last_visit_days": 7, "email_click_rate": 0.4 }</li><li>**Example Output:** json { "customer_id": 12345, "propensity_score": 0.82 }</li></ul> |

### Training Data

| Question | Information needed | Example answer |
| --- | --- | --- |
| What datasets were used to train the model? | Description of the data sources. | The model was trained on first-party, anonymized customer interaction data collected via Adobe Experience Platform. It includes historical customer behavioral data, transaction records, email interactions, and engagement metrics across multiple industries. |
| What is the size and source of the data? | Volume and origin of the training dataset. | The training dataset consists of 10 million customer records sourced from a diverse set of Adobe Experience Platform customers. These records include historical customer interactions, transactional data, behavioral engagement logs, and demographic information from various industries such as retail, e-commerce, telecommunications, and finance. Data was collected over a 24-month period, ensuring sufficient representation of seasonal trends and long-term engagement patterns. |
| Are there any known biases in the dataset? | Bias considerations and mitigation efforts. | The dataset is predominantly sourced from high-engagement users, which may introduce selection bias. To mitigate this, the model applies stratified sampling, bias auditing techniques, and data augmentation strategies. |
| How is the data preprocessed? | Steps taken to clean and prepare the data. | The dataset undergoes extensive preprocessing to ensure data consistency, quality, and usability. <ol><li>**Handling Missing Values**: Missing values are addressed using a combination of mean imputation (for numerical fields), mode imputation (for categorical fields), and predictive modeling (for complex missing cases).</li><li>**Categorical Encoding:** Categorical variables such as customer segments and purchase categories are converted into numerical representations through one-hot encoding and target encoding techniques.</li><li>**Feature Scaling & Normalization:** Min-max scaling is applied for bounded variables (e.g., age, income), while z-score standardization is used for normally distributed features.</li><li>**Additional Preprocessing:** The pipeline includes outlier detection and removal, duplicate filtering, timestamp standardization, and feature engineering to enhance predictive.</li></ol> |
