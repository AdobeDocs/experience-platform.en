# Customer AI Propensity Scoring Model Card

As part of Intelligent Services in Adobe Experience Platform, you can use Customer AI to generate customer predictions and explanations at the individual level.

With the help of influential factors, you can use Customer AI to tell you what a customer is likely to do and why. Additionally, you can benefit from Customer AI predictions and insights to personalize customer experiences by serving the most appropriate offers and messaging.

Read this model card for information the AI model used to power Customer AI.

## Model overview

* CustomerAI is an AI-powered model designed to generate propensity scores for users based on their past behaviors and interactions with a business. It helps predict the likelihood of a customer taking specific actions, such as making a purchase, engaging with content, or churning. This model is deployed within Adobe Experience Platform and integrates with various marketing and customer analytics workflows.
* The model is designed to provide marketers and customer engagement teams with actionable insights by predicting the probability that a customer will perform a given action, such as making a purchase, signing up for a subscription, or engaging with an email campaign. The outputs allow businesses to optimize audience segmentation and personalize customer interactions based on predicted behaviors.
* This is a supervised learning classification model that predicts the probability of an event occurring (e.g., purchase, churn, engagement) given historical customer data. It is trained using gradient boosting decision trees (GBDT) with logistic regression to model propensity scores.
* The primary users of this model are marketing professionals, data analysts, and customer engagement teams who leverage Adobe Experience Platform to drive data-driven marketing strategies.
* CustomerAI integrates directly into Adobe Experience Platform's AI services, allowing users to access model outputs through pre-built APIs and dashboards. The propensity scores generated by the model can be used within Adobe Journey Optimizer, and Adobe Real-Time CDP, to refine audience segmentation and tailor marketing strategies.

## Intended use

* This model is primarily used for customer segmentation, targeted marketing, and churn prediction. Businesses leverage this model to predict customer purchase intent, optimize marketing campaigns, and enhance personalization efforts. For example, an e-commerce company might use the model to identify high-intent shoppers and offer them exclusive promotions.
* Marketers often struggle with identifying the right customers to target and optimizing engagement efforts. This model reduces guesswork by providing a data-driven approach to customer targeting, ensuring that marketing resources are allocated efficiently.
* The model is applicable across multiple industries, including e-commerce, retail, financial services, telecommunications, and media. Any business that relies on customer engagement and personalized marketing can benefit from this model.
* The model should not be used for high-risk decision-making, such as financial credit scoring, medical diagnostics, or legal assessments. Additionally, it is not intended for use in predicting personally sensitive behaviors (e.g., health conditions, political preferences) due to potential ethical concerns.

## Model inputs and outputs

* The model processes customer behavioral data, demographic attributes, and historical interactions. This includes data such as website visit frequency, past purchase history, engagement with marketing emails, and demographic information.
* Input data must be structured as JSON objects containing customer attributes and behavioral signals. For batch processing, the model accepts CSV files formatted according to Adobe Experience Platform's data ingestion standards.
* The model outputs a propensity score between 0 and 1, where higher values indicate a higher likelihood of the predicted event occurring. Additionally, it provides feature importance scores, allowing users to understand which factors influenced the prediction.

**Example input**

```json
{
  "customer_id": 12345,
  "past_purchases": 3,
  "last_visit_days": 7,
  "email_click_rate": 0.4
}
```

**Example output**

```json
{
  "customer_id": 12345,
  "propensity_score": 0.82
}
```

## Training data

* The training dataset consists of 10 million customer records sourced from a diverse set of Adobe Experience Platform customers. These records include historical customer interactions, transactional data, behavioral engagement logs, and demographic information from various industries such as retail, e-commerce, telecommunications, and finance. Data was collected over a 24-month period, ensuring sufficient representation of seasonal trends and long-term engagement patterns.
* The dataset is predominantly sourced from high-engagement users, which may introduce selection bias. To mitigate this, the model applies stratified sampling, bias auditing techniques, and data augmentation strategies.
* The dataset undergoes extensive preprocessing to ensure data consistency, quality, and usability. 
  * **Handling Missing Values**: Missing values are addressed using a combination of mean imputation (for numerical fields), mode imputation (for categorical fields), and predictive modeling (for complex missing cases). 
  * **Categorical Encoding**: Categorical variables such as customer segments and purchase categories are converted into numerical representations through one-hot encoding and target encoding techniques. 
  * **Feature Scaling & Normalization**: Min-max scaling is applied for bounded variables (e.g., age, income), while z-score standardization is used for normally distributed features. 
  * **Additional Preprocessing**: The pipeline includes outlier detection and removal, duplicate filtering, timestamp standardization, and feature engineering to enhance predictive modeling.

## Model architecture and training

* The model leverages Gradient Boosting Decision Trees (GBDT) using XGBoost, optimized for structured data. It is trained on historical customer event sequences to identify predictive behavioral patterns.
* The model is built using a supervised learning approach, leveraging Gradient Boosting Decision Trees (GBDT) with XGBoost as the primary learning algorithm. Additionally, logistic regression is incorporated as a baseline model for benchmarking predictive accuracy. 
* The model was developed using TensorFlow, XGBoost, and scikit-learn. Training runs on Adobe AI cloud infrastructure using NVIDIA V100 GPUs, supporting large-scale datasets.
* NVIDIA V100 GPUs, trained on Google Cloud infrastructure.
* AUC-ROC, precision-recall, and cross-validation.
