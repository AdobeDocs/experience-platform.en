## Model overview {#model-overview}

* Customer AI is an AI-powered model designed to generate propensity scores for users based on their past behaviors and interactions with a business. Use Customer AI to predict the likelihood of a customer taking specific actions, such as making a purchase, engaging with content, or churning. This model is deployed within Experience Platform and integrates with various marketing and customer analytics workflows.
* The model is designed to provide marketers and customer engagement teams with actionable insights by predicting the probability that a customer will perform a given action, such as making a purchase, signing up for a subscription, or engaging with an email campaign. The outputs allow businesses to optimize audience segmentation and personalize customer interactions based on predicted behaviors.
* This is a **supervised learning classification model** that predicts the probability of an event occurring (purchase, churn, engagement) given historical customer data. It is trained using gradient boosting decision trees (GBDT) with logistic regression to model propensity scores.
* The primary users of this model are marketing professionals, data analysts, and customer engagement teams who leverage Experience Platform to drive data-driven marketing strategies.
* Customer AI integrates directly into Experience Platform's AI services, allowing users to access model outputs through pre-built APIs and dashboards. The propensity scores generated by the model can be used within [Adobe Journey Optimizer](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/journey-optimizer/using/get-started/get-started), and [Real-Time CDP](../../../rtcdp/home.md), to refine audience segmentation and tailor marketing strategies.

## Intended use {#intended-use}

* This model is primarily used for **customer segmentation, targeted marketing, and churn prediction**. Businesses leverage this model to **predict customer purchase intent, optimize marketing campaigns, and enhance personalization efforts**. For example, an e-commerce company might use the model to identify high-intent shoppers and offer them exclusive promotions.
* Marketers often struggle with **identifying the right customers to target** and **optimizing engagement efforts**. This model **reduces guesswork** by providing a data-driven approach to customer targeting, ensuring that marketing resources are allocated efficiently.
* The model is applicable across multiple industries, including e-commerce, retail, financial services, telecommunications, and media. Any business that relies on customer engagement and personalized marketing can benefit from this model.

## Model inputs and outputs {#model-inputs-and-outputs}

* The model processes customer behavioral data, demographic attributes, and historical interactions. This includes data such as website visit frequency, past purchase history, engagement with marketing emails, and demographic information.
* Input data must be structured as JSON objects containing customer attributes and behavioral signals. For batch processing, the model accepts CSV files formatted according to Experience Platform's data ingestion standards.
* The model outputs a propensity score between 0 and 1, where higher values indicate a higher likelihood of the predicted event occurring. Additionally, it provides feature importance scores, allowing users to understand which factors influenced the prediction.

**Example input**

```json
{
  "customer_id": 12345,
  "past_purchases": 3,
  "last_visit_days": 7,
  "email_click_rate": 0.4
}
```

**Example output**

```json
{
  "customer_id": 12345,
  "propensity_score": 0.82
}
```

## Training data

* The model was trained on **first-party, anonymized customer interaction data** collected via Experience Platform. It includes historical customer **behavioral data, transaction records, email interactions, and engagement metrics** across multiple industries.
* The training dataset consists of **10 million customer records** sourced from a diverse set of Experience Platform customers. These records include **historical customer interactions, transactional data, behavioral engagement logs, and demographic information** from various industries such as retail, e-commerce, telecommunications, and finance. Data was collected over a 24-month period, ensuring sufficient representation of seasonal trends and long-term engagement patterns.
* The dataset is predominantly sourced from high-engagement users, which may introduce selection bias. To mitigate this, the model applies stratified sampling, bias auditing techniques, and data augmentation strategies.
* The dataset undergoes extensive preprocessing to ensure data consistency, quality, and usability. 
  * **Handling Missing Values**: Missing values are addressed using a combination of mean imputation (for numerical fields), mode imputation (for categorical fields), and predictive modeling (for complex missing cases). 
  * **Categorical Encoding**: Categorical variables such as customer segments and purchase categories are converted into numerical representations through one-hot encoding and target encoding techniques. 
  * **Feature Scaling & Normalization**: Min-max scaling is applied for bounded variables (age, income), while z-score standardization is used for normally distributed features. 
  * **Additional Preprocessing**: The pipeline includes outlier detection and removal, duplicate filtering, timestamp standardization, and feature engineering to enhance predictive modeling.

## Model architecture and training

* The model leverages **[!DNL Gradient Boosting Decision Trees] (GBDT) using [!DNL XGBoost]**, optimized for structured data. It is trained on historical customer event sequences to identify predictive behavioral patterns.
* The model is built using a supervised learning approach, leveraging GBDT with [!DNL XGBoost] as the primary learning algorithm. Additionally, logistic regression is incorporated as a baseline model for benchmarking predictive accuracy. 
* The model was developed using **[!DNL TensorFlow]**, **[!DNL XGBoost]**, and **[!DNL scikit-learn]**. Training runs on Adobe AI cloud infrastructure using **[!DNL NVIDIA V100] GPUs**, supporting large-scale datasets.
* [!DNL NVIDIA V100 GPUs], trained on Google Cloud infrastructure.
* [!DNL AUC-ROC], precision-recall, and cross-validation.

## Performance and evaluation

* The model was tested using a holdout validation approach, where 80% of the data was used for training, and 20% was reserved for evaluation.
* The model's effectiveness is measured using [!DNL AUC-ROC] (0.85), precision-recall (0.78), and F1-score (0.80). These metrics help assess the model's predictive power across different segments.
* Lower accuracy for new customer segments with limited historical data. 
* The model may underperform for customers with limited historical data (cold-start problem). Additionally, seasonality effects (holiday shopping trends) may require frequent retraining to maintain accuracy.

## Fairness and bias

* The model underwent **demographic parity testing** and **adversarial fairness evaluations** to detect performance disparities across different user segments.
* Analysis revealed a **5% performance drop for users with low historical interaction data**. To address this, the model incorporates reweighting techniques during training.
* The dataset is stratified to ensure proportional representation of different customer demographics, and fairness constraints are introduced during training to prevent the model from favoring any particular group. Regular bias audits are conducted using demographic parity analysis, allowing adjustments if performance disparities are detected.

## Explainability and interpretability

* The model leverages **[!DNL SHapley Additive Explanations] (SHAP)** to quantify the impact of each input feature on its predictions, providing transparency into how customer attributes influence propensity scores. SHAP values enable both global interpretability, identifying the most influential factors across all predictions, and local interpretability, explaining individual predictions for specific customers.
* The model supports **[!DNL Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations] (LIME)** and SHAP to provide insights into how input features influence predictions. LIME generates local explanations by creating perturbed versions of the input data and observing changes in predictions, while SHAP assigns contribution values to each feature, offering both global and local interpretability of model decisions.

## Robustness and generalization

* The model maintains 80% [!DNL AUC-ROC] when tested on unseen datasets, demonstrating strong generalization to new customer records. Performance remains stable across different customer segments but shows slight degradation when user behavior significantly deviates from historical patterns.
* The model has been evaluated against perturbed and adversarial inputs, including missing data, outlier injection, and intentional mislabeling. While performance remains robust under normal conditions, minor accuracy degradation (approximately 3-5%) was observed under extreme adversarial modifications.

## Security and privacy considerations

* The model **does not process or retain any personally identifiable information (PII)**, and all data used for training is anonymized and aggregated. It adheres to strict compliance with GDPR, CCPA, and internal Adobe privacy policies to ensure responsible data usage.
* The model incorporates differential privacy techniques to add controlled noise to data, preventing re-identification of individuals. Additionally, **hashing, anonymization, and tokenization methods are used to remove PII** before model training and inference.

## Deployment and integration

* The model is hosted on Adobe Experience Platform AI services and integrated with various Adobe applications. It is available via API endpoints, allowing seamless access for real-time predictions and batch processing across marketing and customer engagement workflows.
* The model runs on a **[!DNL Kubernetes]-based deployment** with auto-scaling capabilities to handle varying workloads efficiently. Compute resources include [!DNL NVIDIA V100] GPUs for training and optimized CPU-based inference for real-time scalability.

## Monitoring and maintenance

* The model is continuously **monitored via [!DNL WatsonX]**, tracking key performance indicators such as accuracy drift, feature importance shifts, and prediction stability. Anomaly detection and alerting mechanisms notify the team when significant deviations from expected behavior occur.
* The model is retrained monthly using updated customer interaction data to ensure continued relevance. Periodic retraining helps mitigate data drift and seasonal fluctuations that could impact predictive accuracy

## Ethical concerns and responsible AI

* The model could potentially introduce bias in decision-making if not monitored correctly. For example, if certain demographics are overrepresented in the training data, the model might unfairly favor specific customer groups.
* Experience Platform follows responsible AI guidelines, ensuring that models undergo **bias audits, fairness testing, and human oversight** before deployment.

## Known limitations

* The model may struggle to accurately predict outcomes for newly launched products or customer segments where insufficient historical data is available. Additionally, seasonal variations in customer behavior can cause fluctuations in predictive accuracy if not accounted for during retraining.
* Performance declines when customer history is sparse, such as for first-time buyers or users with minimal engagement data. Additionally, if customer behaviors **shift due to external factors like economic downturns or industry trends**, the model may require rapid adaptation to maintain accuracy.

## Future improvements

* Future iterations will include transfer learning techniques to improve performance for cold-start users and enhance adaptability to changing customer behaviors. Additionally, real-time data integration will be introduced to improve model responsiveness and accuracy in dynamic marketing environments.
