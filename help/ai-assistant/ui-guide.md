# AI Assistant UI Guide

Read this guide to learn how you can use AI Assistant in the Adobe Experience Platform UI.

To launch AI Assistant, select the **[!UICONTROL AI Assistant icon]** from the top header of the Experience Platform UI.

![The Experience Platform home page, with the AI Assistant icon selected and the AI Assistant interface open.](./images/ai-assistant-full-icon.png)

The AI Assistant interface appears, immediately providing you with information to get started. You can use the options provided under [!UICONTROL Ideas to get started] to answer questions and commands such as:

* [!UICONTROL Which of my audiences are activated?] 
* [!UICONTROL What is a schema?]
* [!UICONTROL Tell me some common use cases for Real-Time CDP]

## AI Assistant UI guide

>[!NOTE]
>
>The following workflow is an example that uses the experience event schema creation process to illustrate how you can use AI Assistant when using the Experience Platform UI.

Consider a use case in which you are creating a **Device Trade in Event Schema**. During the experience event schema creation process, you come across the `eventType` field. "At this point, you have the option to either exit your workflow and refer to the [basics of a schema composition](../xdm/schema/composition.md) documentation, or you can use AI Assistant to retrieve answers to your questions and find additional resources through the documentation links recommended by AI Assistant."

To begin, enter your question in the text box provided. In the example below, AI Assistant is provided the question: "**What is the eventType field in an ExperienceEvent schema?**"

![AI Assistant for Experience Platform with the following question prepared for querying: "What is the eventType field in an ExperienceEvent schema?](./images/question.png)

AI Assistant then queries its knowledge base and computes an answer. After a few moments, AI Assistant returns an answer and related suggestions that you can use as follow up prompts.

After receiving a response from AI Assistant, you can select from a number of options to decide how you want to proceed.
