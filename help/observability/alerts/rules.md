# Standard alert rules

Adobe Experience Platform provides several predefined alert rules that you can enable for your organization. This document covers the details of these Adobe-provided alert rules. For more general information on alerts in Experience Platform, see the [alerts overview](./overview.md).

When [viewing alert rules in the Platform UI](./ui.md), you can subscribe to each rule individually. When subscribing to alerts through [I/O Event notifications](./subscribe.md), however, alert rules are organized into different subscription packages. In the tables below, each rule is shown with its corresponding I/O Event subscription name.

## Data Ingestion

The following alert rules are specific to [Data Ingestion](../../ingestion/home.md) and  [sources](../../sources/home.md):

>[!NOTE]
>
>Streaming sources are currently not supported by alerts. You can only subscribe to alert notifications for batch sources.

| I/O Event subscription | Alert rule | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Source Flow Run Info | Sources Flow Run Start | This alert triggers when a source connection starts processing data. |
| Source Flow Run Info | Sources Flow Run Success | This alert triggers when data is successfully ingested from a source connection. |
| Source Flow Run Delays, Failures and Errors | Sources Flow Run Failure | This alert triggers when an error occurs while ingesting data from a source connection. |
| Source Flow Run Delays, Failures and Errors | Ingestion Delay | This alert triggers when a batch ingestion flow run takes longer than 150 minutes to process. |
| Source Flow Run Delays, Failures and Errors | Ingestion Failure | This alert triggers when the ratio of failed records to all records exceed a threshold of 0.5%. |

| --- | --- | --- |
| Profile Ingestion Info | Profile Flow Run Start | This alert triggers when a Profile flow run starts processing data. |
| Profile Ingestion Info | Profile Flow Run Success | This alert triggers when data is successfully loaded into Profile from the Data Lake. |
| Profile Ingestion Delays, Failures and Errors | Profile Flow Run Delay | This alert triggers when loading data from the Data Lake into Profile takes longer than 150 minutes to process. |
