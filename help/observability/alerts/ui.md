# Alerts UI guide (Beta)

>[!IMPORTANT]

>Alerts in Adobe Experience Platform are not available to all users yet. This feature is in beta and still being tested. This document is subject to change.

The Adobe Experience Platform user interface allows you to view a history of received alerts based on metrics revealed by Adobe Experience Platform Observability Insights. The UI also allows you to view, enable, disable, and subscribe to available alert rules.

>[!NOTE]
>
>For an introduction to alerts in Experience Platform, see the [alerts overview](./overview.md).

To get started, select **[!UICONTROL Alerts]** in the left navigation.

Select a rule from the list to view its description and its configuration parameters in the right rail, including threshold and severity.

Select the ellipsis (**...**) next to a rule's name, and a dropdown displays controls to enable or disable the alert (depending on its current status), and to subscribe or unsubscribe to email notifications for the alert.
