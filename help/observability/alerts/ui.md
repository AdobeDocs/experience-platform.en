# Alerts UI guide

The Adobe Experience Platform user interface allows you to view a history of received alerts based on metrics revealed by Adobe Experience Platform Observability Insights. The UI also allows you to view, enable, disable, and subscribe to available alert rules.

To get started, select **[!UICONTROL Alerts]** in the left navigation.

## Manage alert rules

The **[!UICONTROL Browse]** tab lists the available rules that may trigger an alert.

Select a rule from the list to view its description and its configuration parameters in the right rail, including threshold and severity.

Select the ellipsis (**...**) next to a rule's name, and a dropdown displays controls to enable or disable the alert (depending on its current status), and to subscribe or unsubscribe to email notifications for the alert.

## Enable email alerts

Alert notifications can be delivered direct to your email. 

Select the bell icon (![bell icon](../images/alerts/ui/bell-icon.png)) located in the top ribbon on the right to display notifications and announcements. In the dropdown that appears, select the cog icon (![cog icon](../images/alerts/ui/cog-icon.png)) to access the Experience Cloud preferences page.
