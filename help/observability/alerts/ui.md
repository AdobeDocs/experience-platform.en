# Alerts UI guide

The Adobe Experience Platform user interface allows you to view a history of received alerts based on metrics revealed by Adobe Experience Platform Observability Insights. The UI also allows you to view, enable, disable, and subscribe to available alert rules.

Select the ellipsis (**...**) next to a rule's name, and a dropdown displays controls to enable or disable the alert (depending on its current status), and to subscribe or unsubscribe to email notifications for the alert.
