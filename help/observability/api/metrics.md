# Metrics endpoint

Observability metrics provide insights into usage statistics, historical trends, and performance indicators for various features in Adobe Experience Platform. The `/metrics` endpoint in the [!DNL Observability Insights API] allows you to programmatically retrieve metric data for your organization's activity in [!DNL Platform].

>[!NOTE]
>
>The previous version of the metrics endpoint (V1) has been deprecated. This document focuses exclusively on the current version (V2). For details on the V1 endpoint for legacy implementations, please refer to the [API reference](https://www.adobe.io/experience-platform-apis/references/observability-insights/#operation/retrieveMetricsV1).

## Getting started

The API endpoint used in this guide is part of the [[!DNL Observability Insights] API](https://www.adobe.io/experience-platform-apis/references/observability-insights/). Before continuing, please review the [getting started guide](./getting-started.md) for links to related documentation, a guide to reading the sample API calls in this document, and important information regarding required headers that are needed to successfully make calls to any [!DNL Experience Platform] API.

## Retrieve observability metrics

You can retrieve metrics data by making a POST request to the `/metrics` endpoint, specifying the metrics you wish to retrieve in the payload.

**API format**

```http
POST /metrics
```

**Request**

```sh
curl -X POST \
  https://platform.adobe.io/data/infrastructure/observability/insights/metrics \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer {ACCESS_TOKEN}' \
  -H 'x-api-key: {API_KEY}' \
  -H 'x-gw-ims-org-id: {ORG_ID}' \
  -H 'x-sandbox-name: {SANDBOX_NAME}' \
  -d '{
        "start": "2020-07-14T00:00:00.000Z",
        "end": "2020-07-22T00:00:00.000Z",
        "granularity": "day",
        "metrics": [
          {
            "name": "timeseries.ingestion.dataset.recordsuccess.count",
            "filters": [
              {
                "name": "dataSetId",
                "value": "5edcfb2fbb642119194c7d94|5eddb21420f516191b7a8dad",
                "groupBy": true
              }
            ],
            "aggregator": "sum",
            "downsample": "sum"
          },
          {
            "name": "timeseries.ingestion.dataset.dailysize",
            "filters": [
              {
                "name": "dataSetId",
                "value": "5eddb21420f516191b7a8dad",
                "groupBy": false
              }
            ],
            "aggregator": "sum",
            "downsample": "sum"
          }
        ]
      }'
```

| Property | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `start` | The earliest date/time from which to retrieve metric data. |
| `end` | The latest date/time from which to retrieve metric data. |
| `granularity` | An optional field that indicates the time interval to divide metric data by. For example, a value of `DAY` returns metrics for each day between the `start` and `end` date, whereas a value of `MONTH` would group metric results by month instead. When using this field, a corresponding `downsample` property must also be provided to indicate the aggregation function by which to group data. |
| `metrics` | An array of objects, one for each metric you want to retrieve. |
| `name` | The name of a metric recognized by Observability Insights. See the [appendix](#available-metrics) for a full list of accepted metric names. |
| `filters` | An optional field that allows you to filter metrics by specific datasets. The field is an array of objects (one for each filter), with each object containing the following properties: <ul><li>`name`: The type of entity to filter metrics against. Currently, only `dataSets` is supported.</li><li>`value`: The ID of one or more datasets. Multiple dataset IDs can be provided as a single string, with each ID separated by vertical bar characters (`\|`).</li><li>`groupBy`: When set to true, indicates that the corresponding `value` represents multiple datasets whose metric results should be returned separately. If set to false, metric results for those datasets are grouped together.</li></ul> |
| `aggregator` | Specifies the aggregation function that should be used to group multiple times-series records into single results. For detailed information on available aggregators, refer to the [OpenTSDB documentation](https://docs.w3cub.com/opentsdb/user_guide/query/aggregators). |
| `downsample` | An optional field that allows you to specify an aggregation function to reduce the sampling rate of metric data by sorting fields into intervals (or "buckets"). The interval for the downsampling is determined by the `granularity` property. For detailed information on downsampling, refer to the [OpenTSDB documentation](https://docs.w3cub.com/opentsdb/user_guide/query/aggregators). |

| Property | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `metricResponses` | An array whose objects represent each of the metrics specified in the request. Each object contains information about the filter configuration and returned metric data. |
| `metric` | The name of one of the metrics provided in the request. |
| `filters` | The filter configuration for the specified metric. |
| `datapoints` | An array whose objects represent the results of the specified metric and filters. The number of objects in the array depends on the filter options provided in the request. If no filters were provided, the array will only contain a single object that represents all datasets. |
| `groupBy` | If multiple datasets were specified in the `filter` property for a metric, and the `groupBy` option was set to true in the request, this object will contain the ID of the dataset that the corresponding `dps` property applies to.<br><br>If this object appears empty in the response, the corresponding `dps` property applies to all datasets provided in the `filters` array (or all datasets in [!DNL Platform] if no filters were provided). |
| `dps` | The returned data for the given metric, filter, and time range. Each key in this object represents a timestamp with a corresponding value for the specified metric. The time period between each datapoint depends on the `granularity` value specified in the request. |
