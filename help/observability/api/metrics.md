# Metrics endpoint

Observability metrics provide insights into usage statistics, historical trends, and performance indicators for various features in Adobe Experience Platform. The `/metrics` endpoint in the [!DNL Observability Insights API] allows you to programmatically retrieve metric data for your organization's activity in [!DNL Platform].

## Getting started

The API endpoint used in this guide is part of the [[!DNL Observability Insights] API](https://www.adobe.io/experience-platform-apis/references/observability-insights/). Before continuing, please review the [getting started guide](./getting-started.md) for links to related documentation, a guide to reading the sample API calls in this document, and important information regarding required headers that are needed to successfully make calls to any [!DNL Experience Platform] API.

## Retrieve observability metrics

There are two supported methods for retrieving metric data using the API:

* [Version 1](#v1): Specify metrics using query parameters.
* [Version 2](#v2): Specify and apply filters to metrics using a JSON payload.

### Version 1 {#v1}

You can retrieve metrics data by making a GET request to the `/metrics` endpoint, specifying metrics through the use of query parameters.

**API format**

At least one metric must be provided in the `metric` parameter. Other query parameters are optional for filtering results.

```http
GET /metrics?metric={METRIC}
GET /metrics?metric={METRIC}&metric={METRIC_2}
GET /metrics?metric={METRIC}&id={ID}
GET /metrics?metric={METRIC}&dateRange={DATE_RANGE}
GET /metrics?metric={METRIC}&metric={METRIC_2}&id={ID}&dateRange={DATE_RANGE}
```

| Parameter | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `{METRIC}` | The metric you want to expose. When combining multiple metrics in a single call, you must use an ampersand (`&`) to separate individual metrics. For example, `metric={METRIC_1}&metric={METRIC_2}`. |
| `{ID}` | The identifier for a particular [!DNL Platform] resource whose metrics you want to expose. This ID may be optional, required, or not applicable depending on the metrics being used. See the [appendix](#available-metrics) for a list of available metrics, including the supported IDs (both required and optional) for each metric. |
| `{DATE_RANGE}` | The date range for the metrics you want to expose, in ISO 8601 format (for example, `2018-10-01T07:00:00.000Z/2018-10-09T07:00:00.000Z`). |

**Request**

```shell
curl -X GET \
  https://platform.adobe.io/data/infrastructure/observability/insights/metrics?metric=timeseries.ingestion.dataset.size&metric=timeseries.ingestion.dataset.recordsuccess.count&id=5cf8ab4ec48aba145214abeb&dateRange=2018-10-01T07:00:00.000Z/2019-06-06T07:00:00.000Z \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer {ACCESS_TOKEN}' \
  -H 'x-api-key: {API_KEY}' \
  -H 'x-gw-ims-org-id: {IMS_ORG}' \
  -H 'x-sandbox-name: {SANDBOX_NAME}'
```

**Response**

A successful response returns a list of objects, each containing a timestamp within the provided `dateRange` and corresponding values for the metrics specified in the request path. If the `id` of a [!DNL Platform] resource is included in the request path, the results will apply only to that particular resource. If the `id` is omitted, the results will apply to all applicable resources within your IMS Organization.

    ],

```

### Version 2 {#v2}

You can retrieve metrics data by making a POST request to the `/metrics` endpoint, specifying the metrics you wish to retrieve in the payload.

**API format**

```http
POST /metrics
```

**Request**

```sh
curl -X POST \

            "downsample": "sum"
          },
          {
            "name": "timeseries.ingestion.dataset.dailysize",
            "filters": [
              {
                "name": "dataSetId",
                "value": "5eddb21420f516191b7a8dad",

          }
        ]
      }'
```

| Property | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `start` | The earliest date/time from which to retrieve metric data. |
| `end` | The latest date/time from which to retrieve metric data. |
| `granularity` | An optional field that indicates the a time interval to divide metric data by. For example, a value of `DAY` returns metrics for each day between the `start` and `end` date, whereas a value of `MONTH` would group metric results by month instead. When using this field, a corresponding `downsample` property must also be provided to indicate the aggregation function by which to group data. |
| `metrics` | An array of objects, one for each metric you want to retrieve. |
| `name` | The name of a metric recognized by Observability Insights. See the [appendix](#available-metrics) for a full list of accepted metric names. |
| `filters` | An optional field that allows you to filter metrics by specific datasets. The field is an array of objects (one for each filter), with each object containing the following properties: <ul><li>`name`: The type of entity to filter metrics against. Currently, only `dataSets` is supported.</li><li>`value`: The ID of one or more datasets. Multiple dataset IDs can be provided as a single string, with each ID separated by vertical bar characters (`|`).</li><li>`groupBy`: When set to true, indicates that the corresponding `value` represents multiple datasets whose metric results should be returned separately. If set to false, metric results for those datasets are grouped together.</li></ul> |
| `aggregator` | Specifies the aggregation function that should be used to group multiple times-series records into single results. For detailed information on available aggregators, refer to the [OpenTSDB documentation](http://opentsdb.net/docs/build/html/user_guide/query/aggregators.html). |
| `downsample` | An optional field that allows you to specify an aggregation function to reduce the sampling rate of metric data by sorting fields into intervals (or "buckets"). The interval for the downsampling is determined by the `granularity` property. For detailed information on downsampling, refer to the [OpenTSDB documentation](http://opentsdb.net/docs/build/html/user_guide/query/downsampling.html). |
