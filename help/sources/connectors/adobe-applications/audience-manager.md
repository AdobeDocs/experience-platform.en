# Audience Manager connector

The Adobe Audience Manager data connector streams first-party data collected in Adobe Audience Manager to Adobe Experience Platform. The Audience Manager connector ingests two categories of data to Platform:

- **Real-time data:** Data captured in real time on Audience Manager's data collection server. This data is used in Audience Manager to populate rule based traits and will surface in Platform in the shortest latency time.
- **Profile data:** Audience Manager uses real-time and on-boarded data to derive customer profiles. These profiles are used to populate identity graphs and traits on segment realizations.

The Audience Manager connector maps these data categories to Experience Data Model (XDM) schema and sends them to Platform. Real-time data are sent as XDM ExperienceEvent data, while Profile data is sent as XDM Individual Profiles.

For instructions on creating a connection with Adobe Audience Manager using the Platform UI, see the [Audience Manager connector tutorial](../../tutorials/ui/create/adobe-applications/audience-manager.md).

## What is Experience Data Model (XDM)?

XDM is a publicly documented specification that provides a standardized framework by which Platform organizes customer experience data.

Adhering to XDM standards allows customer experience data to be uniformly incorporated, making it easier to deliver data and gather information.

For more information about how XDM is used in Experience Platform, see the [XDM System overview](../../../xdm/home.md). To learn more about how XDM Schemas like Profile and ExperienceEvent are structured, see the [basics of schema composition](../../../xdm/schema/composition.md).

## XDM schemas examples

Below are examples of the Audience Manager structure mapped to XDM ExperienceEvent and XDM Individual Profile in Platform.

### ExperienceEvent - for Real-time data and Onboarded data

### XDM Individual Profile - for Profile data

## How are fields mapped from Adobe Audience Manager to XDM?

Please see documentation for [Audience Manager mapping fields](./mapping/audience-manager.md) for more information.

## Data management on Platform

### Datasets

Datasets are a storage and management construct for a collection of data, typically a table, that contains schema (columns) and fields (rows) and is made available by a data connection. Audience Manager data consists of Real-time data, Inbound data, and Profile data. To locate your Audience Manager datasets, use the search function in the UI with the provided naming conventions for each type of data.

Audience Manager datasets are disabled for Profile by default and users have the ability to enable or disable datasets based on their use cases. It is not recommended to disable datasets that will be used for segment membership in Profile.

| Dataset Name | Description | Class | [!DNL Profile] store or [!DNL Data Lake] |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| AAM Real-time | This dataset contains data collected by direct hits on Audience Manager DCS endpoints and identity maps for Audience Manager Profiles. Keep this dataset enabled for Profile ingestion. | Experience event |
| AAM Real-time Profile Updates | This dataset enables Real-time targeting of Audience Manager traits and segments. It includes information for Edge regional routing, trait, and segment membership. Keep this dataset enabled for Profile ingestion. Data is not visible as batches in the dataset. You can enable the **[!UICONTROL Profile]** toggle, to directly ingest the data to Profile. | Record |
| AAM Devices Data | Device data with ECIDs and corresponding segment realizations aggregated in Audience Manager. Data is not visible as batches in the dataset. You can enable the **[!UICONTROL Profile]** toggle, to directly ingest the data to Profile.  | Record |
| AAM Device Profile Data | Used for Audience Manager connector diagnostics. Data is not visible as batches in the dataset. You can enable the **[!UICONTROL Profile]** toggle, to directly ingest the data to Profile.  | Record |
| AAM Authenticated Profiles | This dataset contains Audience Manager authenticated profiles. Data is not visible as batches in the dataset. You can enable the **[!UICONTROL Profile]** toggle, to directly ingest the data to Profile. | Record |
| AAM Authenticated Profiles Meta Data | Used for Audience Manager Connector diagnostics. Data is not visible as batches in the dataset. You can enable the **[!UICONTROL Profile]** toggle, to directly ingest the data to Profile. | Record |
| AAM Devices Data Backfill | Dataset from bringing in past devices data. This contains ECIDs and corresponding segment realizations aggregated in Audience Manager. Data is not visible as batches in the dataset. You can enable the **[!UICONTROL Profile]** toggle to directly ingest the data to Profile. | Record |
| AAM Authenticated Profiles Backfill | Dataset from bringing in past authenticated data. This contains Audience Manager authenticated profiles. Data is not visible as batches in the dataset. You can enable the **[!UICONTROL Profile]** toggle to directly ingest the data to Profile. | Record |

### Connections

Adobe Audience Manager creates one connection in Catalog: Audience Manager Connection. Catalog is the system of the records for data location and lineage within Adobe Experience Platform. A connection is a Catalog object that is a customer-specific instance of Connectors. Please see the [Catalog Service overview](../../../catalog/home.md) for more information on Catalog, connections, and connectors.

## What is the expected latency for Audience Manager Data on Platform?

| Audience Manager Data | Latency | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Real-time data | < 35 minutes. | Time from being captured at Audience Manager Edge node to appearing on Platform Data Lake. |
| Profile data | < 2 days  | Time from being captured via DCS/PCS Edge data and on-boarded data, being processed to a user profile, to then appearing in Profile. This data does not land on Platform Data Lake directly today. Profile toggle can be enabled for Audience Manager Profile datasets to ingest this data directly into Profile. |
