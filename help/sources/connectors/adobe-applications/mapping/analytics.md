# Analytics field mappings

Adobe Experience Platform allows you to ingest Adobe Analytics data through the Analytics source. Some of the data ingested through ADC can be mapped directly from Analytics fields to Experience Data Model (XDM) fields, while other data requires transformations and specific functions to be successfully mapped.

## Advanced mapping fields

Select fields (known as "post values") contain data after Adobe has adjusted their values using Processing rules, VISTA rules, and lookup tables. Most post values have a pre-processed counterpart. Your organization can decide if you want to use the pre-processed field, post-processed field, or both.

To learn more about performing these transformations using Query Service, see [Adobe-defined functions](/help/query-service/sql/adobe-defined-functions.md) in the Query Service user guide.
