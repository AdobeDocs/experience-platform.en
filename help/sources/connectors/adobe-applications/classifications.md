# Adobe Analytics Classifications Data Connector

Adobe Experience Platform allows data to be ingested from external sources while providing you with the ability to structure, label, and enhance incoming data using [!DNL Platform] services. You can ingest data from a variety of sources such as Adobe applications, cloud-based storage, databases, and many others.

[!DNL Experience Platform] provides support for ingesting Analytics Classifications data into Adobe Experience Platform.

Classifications allow for Analytics variable data to be categorized and displayed in different ways when reports are generated. The Analytics Classifications Data Connector requires your data to have been migrated to the new Classifications infrastructure of the Adobe Analytics prior to use. To confirm the migration status of your data, please contact your CSM.
