# Adobe Data Collection

Adobe Experience Platform provides a suite of technologies that allow you to collect customer experience data from client-side sources, and send it to the Adobe Experience Platform Edge Network where it can be enriched, transformed, and distributed to Adobe or non-Adobe destinations in seconds.

The sources integration of Adobe Data Collection allows you to access your Data Collection Experience Edge data, including Data Prep for Data Collection, as well as improved support for data warnings from Data Prep, through the sources catalog.

## Use the sources workspace to access Adobe Data Collection

In the Platform UI, select **[!UICONTROL Sources]** from the left navigation bar to access the [!UICONTROL Sources] workspace. The [!UICONTROL Catalog] screen displays a variety of sources with which you can create an account.

You can select the appropriate category from the catalog on the left-hand side of your screen. Alternatively, you can find the specific source you wish to work with using the search option.

Under the [!UICONTROL Adobe applications] category, select **[!UICONTROL Adobe Data Collection]**, and then select **[!UICONTROL Set up]**.
