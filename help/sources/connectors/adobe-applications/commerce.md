# Adobe Commerce

Adobe Commerce is an agile B2B and B2C commerce platform that enables merchants and brands to accelerate revenue through customer-centric digital commerce experiences across online and physical spaces. 

Adobe Experience Platform Sources supports the integration of Adobe Commerce to allow merchants to send storefront and back office data to the Experience Platform Edge Network, so other Adobe Experience Cloud products like Adobe Analytics and Adobe Target can use [!DNL Commerce] data.

* **Storefront events**: Capture shopper interactions such as `View Page`, `View Product`, and `Add to Cart`. For B2B merchants, storefront events also captures [requisition lists](<https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/commerce-admin/b2b/requisition-lists/requisition-lists.html>).
* **Back office events**: Capture information on the status of an order, such as whether an order was placed, canceled, refunded, shipped, or completed.

>[!NOTE]

>Captured data in Adobe Commerce does not include personally identifiable information (PII). All user identifiers, such as cookie IDs and IP addresses are strictly anonymized.

## Prerequisites

In order to connect Adobe Commerce to Experience Platform, you must have the following:

* Adobe Commerce 2.4.3 or newer.
* A valid Adobe ID and organization ID.
* Access to the [Adobe Client Data Layer extension](../../../tags/extensions/client/client-data-layer/overview.md). This extension is necessary to collect storefront event data.
* Entitlements to other Adobe DX products.

## Onboarding steps

To fully onboard your Adobe Commerce source account, follow the steps outlined below along with their corresponding documentation.

* [Install the Experience Platform connector extension](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/commerce-merchant-services/experience-platform-connector/fundamentals/install.html) for Adobe Commerce. You can download the connector extension from [Adobe Marketplace](https://commercemarketplace.adobe.com/magento-experience-platform-connector.html).
* Once you have successfully installed the connector extension, sign in to your Adobe account in Experience Cloud and [confirm your organization ID](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/core-services/interface/administration/organizations.html#concept_EA8AEE5B02CF46ACBDAD6A8508646255). This ID is associated with your provisioned Experience Cloud company. It is formatted as a 24-character alphanumeric string and includes a mandatory `@AdobeOrg`.
* Next, create or update your Experience Data Model (XDM) schema with your Commerce-specific field groups. For detailed steps on how to add Commerce-specific field groups to your XDM schema, read the guide on [adding field groups to an XDM schema](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/commerce-merchant-services/experience-platform-connector/fundamentals/update-xdm.html).
* Once your schema is configured, you must then create a dataset based off of your new schema. This dataset will then contain the [!DNL Commerce] data that you send. For detailed steps on how to create a dataset for [!DNL Commerce] data, read the guide on [sending data to Experience Platform](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/platform-learn/implement-mobile-sdk/experience-cloud/platform.html#create-a-dataset).
* Next, create a datastream and select the XDM schema that contains your Commerce-specific field groups. For more information on datastreams, read the [datastreams overview](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-platform/datastreams/overview.html).
* Then, you must connect your Adobe Commerce instance to the [Commerce Services Connector](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/commerce-merchant-services/user-guides/integration-services/saas.html). This allows your Commerce instance to be deployed as SaaS (Software as a Service).
* With all of the aforementioned configurations complete, you can now connect to Experience Platform by configuring both the Commerce Services Connector and the Experience Platform Connector using the [!DNL Commerce Admin]. For more information on this final step, read the guide on [connecting Commerce data to Experience Platform](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/commerce-merchant-services/experience-platform-connector/fundamentals/connect-data.html).
