To create your schema for [!DNL RainFocus] data, read the following documentation for steps on how to create a schema using APIs or the UI.

* [Create the schema using the UI](../../../xdm/tutorials/create-schema-ui.md)
* [Create the schema using the API](../../../xdm/tutorials/create-schema-api.md)

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>* The schema must extend the **XDM ExperienceEvent class.** 
>* You must ensure that the schema includes a **primary identity**, and is **enabled for Profile**. For more information, read the guide on [defining identity fields in the UI](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-platform/xdm/ui/fields/identity.html)
>* You may substitute the example identity (Email) for another appropriate identifier such as a sha256 email or ECID.

### Create an Integration Profile in RainFocus {#create-an-integration-profile-in-rainfocus}

Once your service account and your XDM schema are ready, you can now activate the [!DNL Integration Profile] through the [!DNL RainFocus] platform. The [!DNL Integration Profile] is responsible for streaming data to Experience Platform.

Log into the [[!DNL RainFocus] platform](https://app.rainfocus.com). In the primary navigation, select **[!DNL Libraries]** and then select **[!DNL Integration Profiles]** 

![The RainFocus UI with Libraries and Integration Profiles selected.](/help/sources/images/tutorials/create/rainfocus/rainfocus_integration-profile.png)

To create a new profile, select the **(`+`)** icon. Next, select **Adobe Real-Time Customer Data Platform** and then select **OK**.

![The create integration profile window in the RainFocus UI.](/help/sources/images/tutorials/create/rainfocus/rainfocus_integration-profile-select.png)

Next, provide the credentials that you retrieved in the Adobe Developer Portal Project:

* **Client ID**
* **Client Secret**
* **Technical Account ID**
* **Organization ID**
 
Once the credentials have been provided, select **[!DNL Save]**.You should now see the new [!DNL Integration Profile] listed in the [!DNL RainFocus] dashboard.

Select the [!DNL Integration Profile] that you just created to see a list of predefined **push types** already configured. These are the [Experience Events](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-platform/xdm/classes/experienceevent.html) that will be sent to Experience Platform when they occur. 

![A list of predefined push types in the RainFocus dashboard.](/help/sources/images/tutorials/create/rainfocus/rainfocus_integration-profile-setup.png)

To retrieve a copy of the sample JSON payload, select **[!DNL Sample JSON Payload]**. Next, highlight and copy the sample JSON payload and **save it in a new file with a .json extension**. This will be used later in Experience Platform for [mapping configurations](../../tutorials/ui/create/analytics/rainfocus.md#mapping).

>[!TIP]
>
>**Setup is not yet complete**: Once your dataflow is created, you will need to return to the [!DNL RainFocus] dashboard to complete your [!DNL Integration Profile] by providing your **streaming endpoint URL** and **dataflow ID**.

## Next steps

By reading this document, you have completed prerequisite setup needed in order to stream data from your [!DNL RainFocus] account to Experience Platform. You can now proceed to the guide on [connecting [!DNL RainFocus] to Experience Platform using the user interface](../../tutorials/ui/create/analytics/rainfocus.md).
