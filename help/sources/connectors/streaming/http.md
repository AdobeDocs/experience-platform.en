# [!DNL HTTP API] connector

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>You can now use the [!DNL HTTP API] source when running Adobe Experience Platform on Amazon Web Services (AWS). Experience Platform running on AWS is currently available to a limited number of customers. To learn more about the supported Experience Platform infrastructure, see the [Experience Platform multi-cloud overview](../../../landing/multi-cloud.md).

Adobe Experience Platform allows data to be ingested from external sources while providing you with the ability to structure, label, and enhance incoming data using [!DNL Experience Platform] services. You can ingest data from a variety of sources such as Adobe applications, cloud-based storage, databases, and many others.

You can use the [!DNL HTTP API] source connector to stream your data to Experience Platform. The [!DNL HTTP API] source is supported by [!DNL Data Prep] functions, allowing you to map any non XDM-compliant data to an XDM-compliant dataset.

>[!NOTE]
>
>After you create or update a streaming dataflow, a brief 5-minute pause in data ingestion is required to prevent any potential instances of data loss or data drops.
