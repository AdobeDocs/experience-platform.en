# Microsoft Dynamics connector

Adobe Experience Platform allows data to be ingested from external sources while providing you with the ability to structure, label, and enhance incoming data using [!DNL Platform] services. You can ingest data from a variety of sources such as Adobe applications, cloud-based storage, databases, and many others.

[!DNL Experience Platform] provides support for ingesting data from a third-party CRM system. Support for CRM providers include [!DNL Microsoft Dynamics].

## IP address allow list

A list of IP addresses must be added to an allow list prior to working with source connectors. Failing to add your region-specific IP addresses to your allow list may lead to errors or non-performance when using sources. See the [IP address allow list](../../ip-address-allow-list.md) page for more information.

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>The [!DNL Microsoft Dynamics] source connector currently does not support same-region connectivity to Platform. This means that if your Azure instance is using the same network region as Platform, then a connection to Platform sources cannot be established. Currently, only cross-region connectivity is supported. Please contact your Adobe account manager for more information.
