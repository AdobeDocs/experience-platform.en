# (Beta) [!DNL Generic REST API]

>[!NOTE]
>
>The [!DNL Generic REST API] source is in beta. See the [Sources overview](../../home.md#terms-and-conditions) for more information on using beta-labeled connectors.

Adobe Experience Platform allows data to be ingested from external sources while providing you with the ability to structure, label, and enhance incoming data using [!DNL Platform] services. You can ingest data from a variety of sources such as Adobe applications, cloud-based storage, databases, and many others.

Platform provides support for ingesting data from protocols applications, including [!DNL Generic REST API].

The [!DNL Generic REST API] source allows you to bring data from REST-based applications into Platform. [!DNL Generic REST API] supports both basic authentication and OAuth 2 refresh code-based authentication.

## IP address allow list

A list of IP addresses must be added to an allow list prior to working with source connectors. Failing to add your region-specific IP addresses to your allow list may lead to errors or non-performance when using sources. See the [IP address allow list](../../ip-address-allow-list.md) page for more information.

The documentation below provides information on how to connect a [!DNL Generic REST API] source to Platform using APIs.
