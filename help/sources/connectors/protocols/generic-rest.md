Adobe Experience Platform allows data to be ingested from external sources while providing you with the ability to structure, label, and enhance incoming data using [!DNL Experience Platform] services. You can ingest data from a variety of sources such as Adobe applications, cloud-based storage, databases, and many others.

Experience Platform provides support for ingesting data from protocols applications, including [!DNL Generic REST API].

The [!DNL Generic REST API] source allows you to bring data from REST-based applications into Experience Platform. [!DNL Generic REST API] supports both basic authentication and OAuth 2 refresh code-based authentication.

## IP address allowlist

You must add region-specific IP addresses to your allowlist prior to connecting your sources to Experience Platform. For more information, read the guide on [allowlisting IP addresses to connect to Experience Platform](../../ip-address-allow-list.md) for more information.
