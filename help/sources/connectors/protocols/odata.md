# (Beta) [!DNL Generic OData] connector

>[!NOTE]
>
>The [!DNL Generic OData] connector is in beta. See the [Sources overview](../../home.md#terms-and-conditions) for more information on using beta-labelled connectors.

Adobe Experience Platform allows data to be ingested from external sources while providing you with the ability to structure, label, and enhance incoming data using [!DNL Platform] services. You can ingest data from a variety of sources such as Adobe applications, cloud-based storage, databases, and many others.

[!DNL Experience Platform] provides support for ingesting data from a third-party protocols application. Support for protocols providers include [!DNL Generic OData].

## IP address allow list

A list of IP addresses must be added to an allow list prior to working with source connectors. Failing to add your region-specific IP addresses to your allow list may lead to errors or non-performance when using sources. See the [IP address allow list](../../ip-address-allow-list.md) page for more information.

The documentation below provides information on how to connect [!DNL Generic OData] to [!DNL Platform] using APIs or the user interface:

## Connect [!DNL Generic OData] to [!DNL Platform] using APIs

- [Create a Generic OData base connection using the Flow Service API](../../tutorials/api/create/protocols/odata.md)
- [Explore the data structure and contents of a protocols source using the Flow Service API](../../tutorials/api/explore/protocols.md)
- [Create a dataflow for a protocols source using the Flow Service API](../../tutorials/api/collect/protocols.md)

## Connect [!DNL Generic OData] to [!DNL Platform] using the UI

- [Create a Generic OData source connection in the UI](../../tutorials/ui/create/protocols/odata.md)
- [Create a dataflow for a protocols source connection in the UI](../../tutorials/ui/dataflow/protocols.md)
