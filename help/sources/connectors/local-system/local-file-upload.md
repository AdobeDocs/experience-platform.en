# Local file upload connector

Adobe Experience Platform allows data to be ingested from external sources and local systems while providing you with the ability to structure, label, and enhance incoming data using [!DNL Platform] services. You can ingest data from a variety of sources such as Adobe applications, cloud-based storage, databases, and many others.

Experience Platform provides support for ingesting data from your local system, allowing you to bring local files over to Experience Platform through the use of source connectors.

The documentation below provides information on how to connect your local system to Platform using the user interface:
