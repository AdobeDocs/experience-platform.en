# Azure Blob connector

Adobe Experience Platform provides native connectivity for cloud providers like AWS, [!DNL Google Cloud Platform], and [!DNL Azure]. You can bring your data from these systems into [!DNL Platform].

Cloud storage sources can bring your own data into [!DNL Platform] without the need to download, format, or upload. Ingested data can be formatted as XDM JSON, XDM parquet, or delimited. Every step of the process is integrated into the Sources workflow. [!DNL Platform] allows you to bring in data from [!DNL Azure Blob] through batches.

## IP address allow list

The following IP addresses must be added to an allow list prior to working with source connectors. Failing to add your region-specific IP addresses to your allow list may lead to errors or non-performance when using sources.

### East US region

- `20.41.2.0/23`
- `20.41.4.0/26`
- `20.44.17.80/28`
- `20.49.102.16/29`
- `40.70.148.160/28`
- `52.167.107.224/28`

### West Europe region

- `13.69.67.192/28`
- `13.69.107.112/28`
- `13.69.112.128/28`
- `40.74.24.192/26`
- `40.74.26.0/23`
- `40.113.176.232/29`
- `52.236.187.112/28`

### Australia East

- `13.70.74.144/28`
- `20.37.193.0/25`

- `40.79.163.80/28`
- `40.79.171.160/28`

## Naming constraints for files and directories

The following is a list of constraints you must account for when naming your cloud storage file or directory.

- Directory and file component names cannot exceed 255 characters.
- Directory and file names cannot end with a forward slash (`/`). If provided, it will be automatically removed.
- Reserved URL characters must be properly escaped.
- The following characters are not allowed: `" \ / : | < > * ?`.
- Illegal URL path characters not allowed. Code points like `\uE000`, while valid in NTFS filenames, are not valid Unicode characters. In addition, some ASCII or Unicode characters, like control characters (0x00 to 0x1F, \u0081, etc.), are also not allowed. For rules governing Unicode strings in HTTP/1.1 see [RFC 2616, Section 2.2: Basic Rules](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2616.txt) and [RFC 3987](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3987.txt).
- The following file names are not allowed: LPT1, LPT2, LPT3, LPT4, LPT5, LPT6, LPT7, LPT8, LPT9, COM1, COM2, COM3, COM4, COM5, COM6, COM7, COM8, COM9, PRN, AUX, NUL, CON, CLOCK$, dot character (.), and two dot characters (..).

## Connect [!DNL Azure Blob] to [!DNL Platform]

The documentation below provides information on how to connect Azure Blob to Platform using APIs or the user interface:
