# (Beta) IBM DB2 connector

>[!NOTE]
>
>The IBM DB2 connector is in beta. See the [Sources overview](../../home.md#terms-and-conditions) for more information on using beta-labeled connectors.

Adobe Experience Platform provides native connectivity for database providers like [!DNL Microsoft], MySQL, and [!DNL Azure]. You can bring your data from these systems into [!DNL Platform].

Different types of third-party databases are supported, including relational, NoSQL, or data warehouses. Support for database providers includes IBM DB2.

## IP address allow list

A list of IP addresses must be added to an allow list prior to working with source connectors. Failing to add your region-specific IP addresses to your allow list may lead to errors or non-performance when using sources. See the [IP address allow list](../../ip-address-allow-list.md) page for more information.

The documentation below provides information on how to connect IBM DB2 to [!DNL Platform] using APIs or the user interface:

## Connect IBM DB2 to [!DNL Platform] using APIs

- [Create an IBM DB2 base connection using the Flow Service API](../../tutorials/api/create/databases/ibm-db2.md)
- [Explore data tables using the Flow Service API](../../tutorials/api/explore/tabular.md)
- [Create a dataflow for a database source using the Flow Service API](../../tutorials/api/collect/database-nosql.md)

## Connect IBM DB2 to [!DNL Platform] using the UI

- [Create an IBM DB2 source connection in the UI](../../tutorials/ui/create/databases/ibm-db2.md)
- [Create a dataflow for a database source connection in the UI](../../tutorials/ui/dataflow/databases.md)
