# [!DNL Microsoft] SQL Server connector

Adobe Experience Platform allows data to be ingested from external sources while providing you with the ability to structure, label, and enhance incoming data using [!DNL Platform] services. You can ingest data from a variety of sources such as Adobe applications, cloud-based storage, databases, and many others.

[!DNL Experience Platform] provides support for ingesting data from a third-party database. [!DNL Platform] can connect to different types of databases such as relational, NoSQL, or data warehouses. Support for database providers include [!DNL Microsoft] SQL Server.

## IP address allow list

A list of IP addresses must be added to an allow list prior to working with source connectors. Failing to add your region-specific IP addresses to your allow list may lead to errors or non-performance when using sources. See the [IP address allow list](../../ip-address-allow-list.md) page for more information.
