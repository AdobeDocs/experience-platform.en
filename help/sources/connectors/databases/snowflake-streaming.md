# [!DNL Snowflake] streaming source

Adobe Experience Platform allows data to be ingested from external sources while providing you with the ability to structure, label, and enhance incoming data using Platform services. You can ingest data from a variety of sources such as Adobe applications, cloud-based storage, databases, and many others.

Experience Platform provides support for streaming data from a [!DNL Snowflake] database.

See the [IP address allow list](../../ip-address-allow-list.md) page for more information.
