# (Beta) [!DNL Phoenix] connector

>[!NOTE]
>
>The [!DNL Phoenix] connector is in beta. See the [Sources overview](../../home.md#terms-and-conditions) for more information on using beta-labelled connectors.

Adobe Experience Platform allows data to be ingested from external sources while providing you with the ability to structure, label, and enhance incoming data using Platform services. You can ingest data from a variety of sources such as Adobe applications, cloud-based storage, databases, and many others.

[!DNL Experience Platform] provides support for ingesting data from a third-party database. [!DNL Platform] can connect to different types of databases such as relational, NoSQL, or data warehouses. Support for database providers include [!DNL Phoenix].

## IP address allow list

A list of IP addresses must be added to an allow list prior to working with source connectors. Failing to add your region-specific IP addresses to your allow list may lead to errors or non-performance when using sources. See the [IP address allow list](../../ip-address-allow-list.md) page for more information.

The documentation below provides information on how to connect [!DNL Phoenix] to [!DNL Platform] using APIs or the user interface:
