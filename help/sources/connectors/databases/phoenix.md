# [!DNL Phoenix]

Adobe Experience Platform Sources supports data ingestion from third-party databases such as [[!DNL Phoenix]](https://phoenix.apache.org/index.html). This document provides prerequisite information before connecting your [!DNL Phoenix] account through the [!DNL Flow Service] API or the Experience Platform user interface.

## IP address allow list

A list of IP addresses must be added to an allow list prior to working with source connectors. Failing to add your region-specific IP addresses to your allow list may lead to errors or non-performance when using sources. See the [IP address allow list](../../ip-address-allow-list.md) page for more information.
