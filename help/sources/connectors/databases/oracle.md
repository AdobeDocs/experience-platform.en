# (Beta) [!DNL Oracle] connector

>[!NOTE]
>
>The [!DNL Oracle] connector is in beta. See the [Sources overview](../../home.md#terms-and-conditions) for more information on using beta-labelled connectors.

Adobe Experience Platform provides native connectivity for database providers like [!DNL Microsoft], MySQL, and [!DNL Azure]. You can bring your data from these systems into [!DNL Platform].

Different types of third-party databases are supported, including relational, NoSQL, or data warehouses. Support for database providers includes [!DNL Oracle].

## IP address allow list

A list of IP addresses must be added to an allow list prior to working with source connectors. Failing to add your region-specific IP addresses to your allow list may lead to errors or non-performance when using sources. See the [IP address allow list](../../ip-address-allow-list.md) page for more information.

The documentation below provides information on how to connect [!DNL Oracle] to [!DNL Platform] using APIs or the user interface:

## Connect [!DNL Oracle] to [!DNL Platform] using APIs

- [Create an Oracle source connection using the Flow Service API](../../tutorials/api/create/databases/oracle.md)
- [Explore a database system using the Flow Service API](../../tutorials/api/explore/database-nosql.md)
- [Collect data from a database using the Flow Service API](../../tutorials/api/collect/database-nosql.md)

## Connect [!DNL Oracle] to [!DNL Platform] using the UI

- [Create an Oracle source connection in the UI](../../tutorials/ui/create/databases/oracle.md)
- [Configure a dataflow for a database connection in the UI](../../tutorials/ui/dataflow/databases.md)
