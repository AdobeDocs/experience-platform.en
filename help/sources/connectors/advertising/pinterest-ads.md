# [!DNL Pinterest Ads] source

>[!NOTE]
>
>The [!DNL Pinterest Ads] source is in beta. See the [Sources overview](../../home.md#terms-and-conditions) for more information on using beta-labelled connectors.

Adobe Experience Platform allows data to be ingested from external sources while providing you with the ability to structure, label, and enhance incoming data using [!DNL Platform] services. You can ingest data from a variety of sources such as Adobe applications, cloud-based storage, databases, and many others.

[!DNL Experience Platform] provides support for ingesting data from a third-party advertising system. Support for advertising providers include [!DNL Pinterest Ads].

[[!DNL Pinterest Ads]](https://ads.pinterest.com/) allow marketers to reach 400 million people who use [[!DNL Pinterest]](https://www.pinterest.com), a visual discovery engine for finding ideas like recipes, home and style inspiration, and more, on the internet using images, and on a smaller scale, animated GIFs and videos, in the form of pin boards. 

By using [!DNL Pinterest Ads], which are typically just like any other pins, you can reach out to these users through targeted advertisements to discover and buy your products. Pins from [!DNL Pinterest Ads] are sponsored to receive extra exposure in relevant search results. Pinterest Business account holders can choose to promote existing best-performing pins, create a new image or video, or even promote an image thatâ€™s been pinned from a website. Pinterest offers several ad formats to help you meet your specific campaign goals.

## [!DNL Pinterest] APIs {#pinterest-apis}

This Adobe Experience Platform [source](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-platform/sources/home.html?lang=en) leverages the [!DNL Pinterest] APIs to retrieve your [!DNL Pinterest Ads] data, along with all performance and metrics. The supported API endpoints are :

* [Ads](https://developers.pinterest.com/docs/api/v5/#operation/ads/analytics) Analytics

The [!DNL Pinterest Ads] source connection allows you to bring the data from [!DNL Pinterest] to Experience Platform, where you can execute analytics.

The data is returned from today for a backdated range of 186 days. Refer to the [Guardrails](#guardrails) section for details.

[!DNL Pinterest Ads] uses bearer tokens as an authentication mechanism to communicate with the Pinterest APIs.

## Prerequisites {#prerequisites}

The first step in creating a [!DNL Pinterest Ads] source connection is to ensure that you have a Pinterest developer account. If you do not have one already, see the [Signup](https://www.pinterest.com/business/create/?next=https://developers.pinterest.com/account-setup/) page to register and create your account.

### Setup [!DNL Pinterest] App and generate Access Token {#create-app=and-generate-token}

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
> Generating the Access token on the UI provides limited access only to the scopes - pins:read, boards:read and user_accounts:read which is not adequate for usage with the Analytics [!DNL Pinterest] API endpoints.

To generate this access token you will need to
1. [Set up your App](https://developers.pinterest.com/docs/getting-started/set-up-app/).
1. Follow the tutorial section to [Build a working authentication flow based on OAuth 2](https://developers.pinterest.com/docs/getting-started/authentication/).
1. Obtain the required `Access Token`.

### Gather required credentials {#gather-required-credentials}

In order to connect [!DNL Pinterest Ads] to Platform, you must provide values for the following connection properties:

| Credential | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Access Token | The [!DNL Pinterest Ads] access token for your user account.<br> The token's user account must either be the Owner of the specified [!DNL Pinterest Ad] account, or have one of the necessary roles granted to them via Business Access: Admin, Analyst, Campaign Manager.

You will also need one or more [!DNL Pinterest] `Campaign` or `Ad Group` or `Ad` IDs corresponding to `Campaign` or `Ad Group` or `Ad` names, within the fore mentioned `Ad Account ID`, from which you want to retrieve the information. 

>[!NOTE]
>
>[!DNL Pinterest] provides individual APIs to retrieve data associated with each ID, Accordingly you need to pass only the corresponding IDs for the ID type you are interested in.

To obtain the required IDs, navigate to the [!DNL Pinterest] page for **Pinterest Business Hub** > **Ad Account Summary** > **Campaigns** / **Ad Groups** / **Ads** and copy the required ID's mentioned just below each of their names.

* **WEEKLY** - metrics are broken down weekly.
* **MONTHLY** - metrics are broken down monthly.

The [API's](#pinterest-apis) leveraged for the [!DNL Pinterest Ads] source have time range restrictions as mentioned below :
* *If granularity is not HOUR, the furthest back you can are allowed to pull data is 914 days before the current date in UTC time and the max time range supported is 186 days.*
* *If granularity is HOUR, the furthest back you can are allowed to pull data is 8 days before the current date in UTC time and the max time range supported is 3 days.*
