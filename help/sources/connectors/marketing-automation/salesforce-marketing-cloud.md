# [!DNL Salesforce Marketing Cloud]

Adobe Experience Platform allows data to be ingested from external sources while providing you with the ability to structure, label, and enhance incoming data using Platform services. You can ingest data from a variety of sources such as Adobe applications, cloud-based storage, databases, and many others.

Experience Platform provides support for ingesting data from third-party marketing automation systems. Support for marketing automation providers include [!DNL Salesforce Marketing Cloud].

## Prerequisites

Before you can connect your [!DNL Salesforce Marketing Cloud] source to Platform, you must ensure that the following **permission scopes** are provisioned to your [!DNL Salesforce Marketing Cloud] client ID and client secret combination:

* `campaign_read`
* `list_and_subscribers_read`

You can request for scopes by making a call to the `v2/userinfo` resource of the [!DNL Salesforce Marketing Cloud] API. See the [[!DNL Salesforce Marketing Cloud] API Integration Permission Scopes document](<https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/marketing/marketing-cloud/guide/data-access-permissions.html>) for guidance on how to request and compare scopes.

For more information on scopes including a list of their related permissions and behaviors, see this [[!DNL Salesforce Marketing Cloud] REST API document](<https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/marketing/marketing-cloud/guide/rest-permissions-and-scopes.html>).

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>Custom object ingestion is currently not supported by the [!DNL Salesforce Marketing Cloud] source integration.

## IP address allow list

A list of IP addresses must be added to an allow list prior to working with source connectors. Failing to add your region-specific IP addresses to your allow list may lead to errors or non-performance when using sources. See the [IP address allow list](../../ip-address-allow-list.md) page for more information.
