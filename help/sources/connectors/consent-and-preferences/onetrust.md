>[!NOTE]
>
>The [!DNL OneTrust] source is in beta. Its features and documentation are subject to change. For information on using beta-labelled sources, see the [sources overview](../../home.md#terms-and-conditions).

Adobe Experience Platform allows data to be ingested from external sources while providing you with the ability to structure, label, and enhance incoming data using Platform services. You can ingest data from a variety of sources such as Adobe applications, cloud-based storage, databases, and many others.

Experience Platform provides support for ingesting data from a third-party consent and preferences program. Support for consent and preferences providers include [!DNL OneTrust].

## IP address allow list

Failing to add your region-specific IP addresses to your allow list may lead to errors or non-performance when using sources. See the [IP address allow list](../../ip-address-allow-list.md) page for more information.
