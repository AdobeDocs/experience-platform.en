* **Incorrect or missing company domain in Experience Platform**: If the issue stems from an incorrect company domain value in the account data, update the company domain field in Experience Platform to ensure accurate matching.

+++Answer

When a company domain is updated, the new domain value will be applied in the next dataflow run. This ensures that:

Domain matching in Experience Platform is based on an exact match of the scrubbed domain field value. Experience Platform automatically removes prefixes (e.g., https:/<span>/www.) and retains the top-level domain (e.g., adobe.com). Matching requires an exact domain value, with no support for fuzzy matching or subdomains.

### Where can I use intent data?

+++Answer

Intent data can be utilized in [Account Audiences](../../../segmentation/types/account-audiences.md) to enhance targeting, segmentation, and personalization. By leveraging intent signals, businesses can identify and engage with accounts showing high interest in specific topics, optimizing marketing and sales outreach.
