# Update dataflows in the UI

This tutorial provides you with steps on how to update an existing dataflow, including its schedule and mapping, using the sources workspace.

## Getting started

This tutorial requires a working understanding of the following components of Adobe Experience Platform:

* [Sources](../../home.md): Experience Platform allows data to be ingested from various sources while providing you with the ability to structure, label, and enhance incoming data using Platform services.
* [Sandboxes](../../../sandboxes/home.md): Experience Platform provides virtual sandboxes which partition a single Platform instance into separate virtual environments to help develop and evolve digital experience applications.

## Update dataflows

>[!NOTE]
>
>The edit mapping feature is currently not supported for the following sources: Adobe Analytics, Adobe Audience Manager, HTTP API, and [!DNL Marketo Engage].

In the Platform UI, select **[!UICONTROL Sources]** from the left navigation to access the [!UICONTROL Sources] workspace. Select **[!UICONTROL Dataflows]** from the top header to view a list of existing dataflows.

![catalog](../../images/tutorials/update-dataflows/catalog.png)

The [!UICONTROL Dataflows] page contains a list of all existing dataflows, including information about their run status, last run date, and account name.

Select the filter icon ![filter](../../images/tutorials/update/filter.png) on the top left to launch the sort panel.

![filter-dataflows](../../images/tutorials/update-dataflows/filter-dataflows.png)

The sort panel provides a list of all available sources. You can select more than one source from the list to access a filtered selection of dataflows belonging to different sources.

Select the source you wish to work with to see a list of its existing dataflows. Once you have identified the dataflow you want to update, select the ellipses (`...`) beside the account name.

![edit-source](../../images/tutorials/update-dataflows/edit-source.png)

A dropdown menu appears, providing you with options to update the dataflow you selected. From here, you can choose to update a dataflow's mapping sets and ingestion schedule. You can also select options to inspect the dataflow in the monitoring dashboard, as well as disable or delete the dataflow.

Select **[!UICONTROL Edit source]** to update its mapping.

![edit-dataflow](../../images/tutorials/update-dataflows/edit-dataflow.png)

The [!UICONTROL Add data] step appears. Select the appropriate data format to review the contents of your selected data and then select **[!UICONTROL Next]** to proceed.

![add-data](../../images/tutorials/update-dataflows/add-data.png)

The [!UICONTROL Mapping] page provides you with an interface where you can add and remove mapping sets associated with your dataset.

>[!TIP]
>
>Mapping updates are only applied to dataflow runs scheduled in the future.

Select **[!UICONTROL Add new mapping]** to add a new mapping set.

![add-new-mapping](../../images/tutorials/update-dataflows/add-new-mapping.png)

Next, enter the appropriate source field attribute and target XDM field values to complete your additional mapping set. Select **[!UICONTROL Next]** to proceed.

![new-mapping-added](../../images/tutorials/update-dataflows/new-mapping-added.png)

The [!UICONTROL Scheduling] step appears, allowing you to update your dataflow's ingestion schedule and automatically ingest the selected source data with the updated mappings.

>[!NOTE]
>
>You can't update mapping sets for dataflows that were scheduled for one-time ingestion and start time is in the past.

![scheduling](../../images/tutorials/update-dataflows/scheduling.png)

In the [!UICONTROL Dataflow detail] page, you can provide an updated name and description for your dataflow as well as reconfigure your dataflow's error threshold.

Once you have provided your updated values, select **[!UICONTROL Next]**.

![dataflow-detail](../../images/tutorials/update-dataflows/dataflow-detail.png)

The **[!UICONTROL Review]** step appears, allowing you to review your dataflow before it is updated.

Once you have reviewed your dataflow, select **[!UICONTROL Finish]** and allow some time for the dataflow with the new mapping sets to be created.

![review](../../images/tutorials/update-dataflows/review.png)

## Edit schedule

To edit the ingestion schedule of an existing dataflow, select the ellipses (`...`) beside a dataflow name and then select **[!UICONTROL Edit schedule]** from the dropdown menu.

![edit-schedule](../../images/tutorials/update-dataflows/edit-schedule.png)

The **[!UICONTROL Edit schedule]** dialog box provides you with options to update your dataflow's ingestion frequency and interval rate. Once you set your updated frequency and interval values, select **[!UICONTROL Save]**.

>[!NOTE]
>
>You cannot reschedule a dataflow that was scheduled for one-time ingestion.

![schedule-dialog-box](../../images/tutorials/update-dataflows/schedule-dialog-box.png)

| Scheduling | Description |
| ---------- | ----------- |
| Frequency | The frequency at which the dataflow will collect data. Acceptable values for editing frequency schedule for an already existing dataflow include: `minute`, `hour`, `day`, or `week`. |
| Interval | The interval designates the period between two consecutive flow runs. The interval's value should be a non-zero integer and must be greater than or equal to `15`. |

After a few moments, a confirmation box appears on the bottom of the screen to confirm a successful update.

## Next steps

By following this tutorial, you have successfully used the [!UICONTROL Sources] workspace to update the ingestion schedule and mapping sets of your dataflow.

For steps on how to perform these operations programmatically using the [!DNL Flow Service] API, please refer to the tutorial on [updating dataflows using the Flow Service API](../../tutorials/api/update-dataflows.md).
