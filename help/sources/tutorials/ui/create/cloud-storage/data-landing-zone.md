# Create an [!DNL Data Landing Zone] source connection in the UI

This tutorial provides steps for creating a [!DNL Data Landing ZOne] source connection using the Platform user interface.

## Getting started

This tutorial requires a working understanding of the following components of Adobe Experience Platform:

- [[!DNL Experience Data Model (XDM)] System](../../../../../xdm/home.md): The standardized framework by which Experience Platform organizes customer experience data.
  - [Basics of schema composition](../../../../../xdm/schema/composition.md): Learn about the basic building blocks of XDM schemas, including key principles and best practices in schema composition.
  - [Schema Editor tutorial](../../../../../xdm/tutorials/create-schema-ui.md): Learn how to create custom schemas using the Schema Editor UI.
- [[!DNL Real-time Customer Profile]](../../../../../profile/home.md): Provides a unified, real-time consumer profile based on aggregated data from multiple sources.

If you already have a valid [!DNL Data Landing Zone] connection, you may skip the remainder of this document and proceed to the tutorial on [configuring a dataflow](../../dataflow/batch/cloud-storage.md).
