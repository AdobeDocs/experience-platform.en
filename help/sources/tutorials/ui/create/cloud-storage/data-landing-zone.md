# Connect [!DNL Data Landing Zone] to Platform using the UI

[!DNL Data Landing Zone] is a secure, cloud-based file storage facility to bring files into Adobe Experience Platform. Data is automatically deleted from the [!DNL Data Landing Zone] after seven days.

This tutorial provides steps for creating a [!DNL Data Landing Zone] source connection using the Platform user interface.

## Getting started

This tutorial requires a working understanding of the following components of Adobe Experience Platform:

* [Sources](../../../../home.md): Experience Platform allows data to be ingested from various sources while providing you with the ability to structure, label, and enhance incoming data using Platform services.
* [Sandboxes](../../../../../sandboxes/home.md): Experience Platform provides virtual sandboxes which partition a single Platform instance into separate virtual environments to help develop and evolve digital experience applications.

## Bring your files from [!DNL Data Landing Zone] to Platform

In the Platform UI, select **[!UICONTROL Sources]** from the left navigation to access the [!UICONTROL Sources] workspace. The [!UICONTROL Catalog] screen displays a variety of sources that you can create an account with.

You can select the appropriate category from the catalog on the left-hand side of your screen. Alternatively, you can find the specific source you wish to work with using the search bar.

Under the [!UICONTROL cloud storage] category, select [!DNL Data Landing Zone] and then select **[!UICONTROL Add data]**.

The [!UICONTROL Add data] step appears, providing you with an interface to select and preview the data you want to bring to Platform.

For a detailed, step-by-step guide on how to create a dataflow for a cloud storage source, see the tutorial on [creating a cloud storage dataflow to bring data to Platform](../../dataflow/batch/cloud-storage.md).

## Retrieve and refresh your [!DNL Data Landing Zone] credentials

[!DNL Data Landing Zone] is an out-of-the-box source that comes with your Adobe Experience Platform Sources license. [!DNL Data Landing Zone] uses an SAS URI and SAS Token-based authentication. You can retrieve and refresh your authentication credentials from the [!UICONTROL Sources catalog] page.

In the [!UICONTROL Sources catalog], under the [!UICONTROL Cloud storage] category, select the ellipses (**...**) from the **[!UICONTROL Data Landing Zone]** card. From the dropdown menu that appears, select **[!UICONTROL View credentials]**.

![options](../../../../images/tutorials/create/dlz/options.png)

A popover appears, displaying your container name, SAS token, storage account name, and SAS URI. 

Select **[!UICONTROL Refresh credentials]** and allow for a few seconds for your updated credentials to be processed.

>[!TIP]
>
>Your [!DNL Data Landing Zone] credentials are set to auto-expire after 90 days and you must use new credentials to re-connect to [!DNL Data Landing Zone] after expiration. Your dataflows in Platform are not affected by expiring credentials and you can still continue working with new and existing dataflows with your new credentials.

## Next steps

By following this tutorial, you have accessed your [!DNL Data Landing Zone] container and learned to retrieve and refresh your credentials. You can now proceed to the next tutorial on [creating a dataflow to bring data from a cloud storage to Platform](../../dataflow/batch/cloud-storage.md).
