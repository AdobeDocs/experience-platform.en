# Create an [!DNL Data Landing Zone] source connection in the UI

This tutorial provides steps for creating a [!DNL Data Landing Zone] source connection using the Platform user interface.

## Getting started

This tutorial requires a working understanding of the following components of Adobe Experience Platform:

- [[!DNL Experience Data Model (XDM)] System](../../../../../xdm/home.md): The standardized framework by which Experience Platform organizes customer experience data.
  - [Basics of schema composition](../../../../../xdm/schema/composition.md): Learn about the basic building blocks of XDM schemas, including key principles and best practices in schema composition.
  - [Schema Editor tutorial](../../../../../xdm/tutorials/create-schema-ui.md): Learn how to create custom schemas using the Schema Editor UI.
- [[!DNL Real-time Customer Profile]](../../../../../profile/home.md): Provides a unified, real-time consumer profile based on aggregated data from multiple sources.

If you already have a valid [!DNL Data Landing Zone] connection, you may skip the remainder of this document and proceed to the tutorial on [configuring a dataflow](../../dataflow/batch/cloud-storage.md).

## Retrieve and refresh your [!DNL Data Landing Zone] credentials

In the Platform UI, select **[!UICONTROL Sources]** from the left navigation to access the [!UICONTROL Sources] workspace. The [!UICONTROL Catalog] screen displays a variety of sources that you can create an account with.

You can select the appropriate category from the catalog on the left-hand side of your screen. Alternatively, you can find the specific source you wish to work with using the search bar.

Under the [!UICONTROL Cloud storage] category, select **[!UICONTROL Data Landing Zone]** and then select the ellipses (**...**) on the bottom right of the card.
