# Create a [!DNL Microsoft SQL Server] source connection in the UI

Read this tutorial to learn how to connect your [!DNL Microsoft SQL Server] account to Adobe Experience Platform using the user interface.

## Getting started

This tutorial requires a working understanding of the following components of Adobe Experience Platform:

* [[!DNL Experience Data Model (XDM)] System](../../../../../xdm/home.md): The standardized framework by which Experience Platform organizes customer experience data.
  * [Basics of schema composition](../../../../../xdm/schema/composition.md): Learn about the basic building blocks of XDM schemas, including key principles and best practices in schema composition.
  * [Schema Editor tutorial](../../../../../xdm/tutorials/create-schema-ui.md): Learn how to create custom schemas using the Schema Editor UI.
* [[!DNL Real-Time Customer Profile]](../../../../../profile/home.md): Provides a unified, real-time consumer profile based on aggregated data from multiple sources.

If you already have a valid [!DNL SQL Server] connection, you may skip the remainder of this document and proceed to the tutorial on [configuring a dataflow](../../dataflow/databases.md).

### Gather required credentials

In order to connect to [!DNL SQL Server] on [!DNL Platform], you must provide the following connection property:

| Credential | Description |
| ---------- | ----------- |
| `connectionString` | The connection string associated with your [!DNL SQL Server] account. The [!DNL SQL Server] connection string pattern is: `Data Source={SERVER_NAME}\\<{INSTANCE_NAME} if using named instance>;Initial Catalog={DATABASE};Integrated Security=False;User ID={USERNAME};Password={PASSWORD};`. |

For more information about getting started, refer to [this [!DNL SQL Server] document](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/framework/data/adonet/sql/authentication-in-sql-server).

## Connect your [!DNL SQL Server] account

In the Platform UI, select **[!UICONTROL Sources]** from the left navigation to access the [!UICONTROL Sources] workspace. You can select the appropriate category from the catalog on the left-hand side of your screen. Alternatively, you can find the specific source you wish to work with using the search option.

Under the *Databases* category, select **[!DNL Microsoft SQL Server]**, and then select **[!UICONTROL Set up]**.

>[!TIP]
>
>Sources in the sources catalog display the **[!UICONTROL Set up]** option when a given source does not yet have an authenticated account. Once an authenticated account exists, this option changes to **[!UICONTROL Add data]**.

The **[!UICONTROL Connect to Microsoft SQL Server]** page appears. On this page, you can either use new credentials or existing credentials.

>[!BEGINTABS]

>[!TAB Create a new account]

To create a new account, select **[!UICONTROL New account]** and provide a name, an optional description, and your credentials. 

When finished, select **[!UICONTROL Connect to source]** and then allow some time for the new connection to establish.

>[!TAB Use an existing account]

To use an existing account, select **[!UICONTROL Existing account]** and then select the account that you want to use from the existing account catalog.

Select **[!UICONTROL Next]** to proceed.

## Next steps

By following this tutorial, you have established a connection to your [!DNL SQL Server] account. You can now continue on to the next tutorial and [configure a dataflow to bring data into [!DNL Platform]](../../dataflow/databases.md).
