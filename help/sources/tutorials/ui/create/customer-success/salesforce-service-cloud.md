# Connect your [!DNL Salesforce Service Cloud] account to Experience Platform using the UI

This tutorial provides steps on how to connect your [!DNL Salesforce Service Cloud] account and bring your customer success data to Adobe Experience Platform using the Experience Platform user interface.

## Getting started

This tutorial requires a working understanding of the following components of Experience Platform:

* [[!DNL Experience Data Model (XDM)] System](../../../../../xdm/home.md): The standardized framework by which Experience Platform organizes customer experience data.
    * [Basics of schema composition](../../../../../xdm/schema/composition.md): Learn about the basic building blocks of XDM schemas, including key principles and best practices in schema composition.
    * [Schema Editor tutorial](../../../../../xdm/tutorials/create-schema-ui.md): Learn how to create custom schemas using the Schema Editor UI.
* [[!DNL Real-Time Customer Profile]](../../../../../profile/home.md): Provides a unified, real-time consumer profile based on aggregated data from multiple sources.

If you already have a valid [!DNL Salesforce Service Cloud] connection, you may skip the remainder of this document and proceed to the tutorial on [configuring a dataflow for a customer success](../../dataflow/customer-success.md)

### Gather required credentials

The [!DNL Salesforce Service Cloud] source supports basic authentication and OAuth2 Client Credential.
