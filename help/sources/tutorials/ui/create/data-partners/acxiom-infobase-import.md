# Create an [!DNL Acxiom Infobase Data Import] source connection and dataflow in the UI. {#overview}
>[!NOTE]
>
>The [!DNL Acxiom Infobase Data Import] source is in beta. Please read the [sources overview](../../../../home.md#terms-and-conditions) for more information on using beta-labeled sources.

Acxiomâ€™s Infobase Data Import for Adobe Real-Time Customer Data Platform is a process for delivering the most productive prospect audiences possible. [ACXIOM] takes Adobe CDP first-party data via a secure export and runs that data through an award-winning hygiene and identity resolution system/process. This produces a data file to be used as a suppression list. Then, that data file is matched against the Acxiom Global database which enables the prospect lists to be tailored for import.

Read this tutorial to learn how to create an [!DNL Acxiom Infobase Data Import] source connection and dataflow using the Adobe Experience Platform user interface.  This Connector is used to retrieve and map response from Acxiom prospect service using S3 as a drop point.

## Provide dataset and dataflow details

* **Dataset Details**
    * **Target Dataset (Required)** - A dataset is a storage and management construct for a collection of data, typically a table, that contains a schema (columns) and fields (rows). Data that is successfully ingested into Adobe Experience Platform is persisted within the Data Lake as datasets.
        * **New Dataset** - Select **New dataset** to create a new dataset and define a schema structure.
            * **Output dataset name (Required)** - The name of the new dataset.
            * **Description (Optional)** - A brief explanation of the purpose of the dataset.
            * **Schema (Required)** - A dropdown list of schemas that exist in your organization. You can also create your own schema prior to the source configuration process. For more information, read the guide on [creating schema in the UI](../../../../../xdm/tutorials/create-schema-ui.md)
              <br>      ![Creation of a new dataset.](../../../../images/tutorials/create/acxiom-prospect-suppression-data-sourcing/image-source-new-dataset.png)
    * **Existing Dataset** - Select **Existing dataset** to use an existing dataset.
        * **Advanced Search** - This option is an expansion of the existing dataset dropdown, presenting additional details on the datasets before selection, including details such as if they are profile enabled, the date they were created or the selected behavior of the dataset.
          <br>      ![Searching existing datasets](../../../../images/tutorials/create/acxiom-prospect-suppression-data-sourcing/image-source-dataset.png)
    * **Profile Dataset** - Toggle to enable your dataset for ingestion to Real-Time Customer Profile.
    * **Error Diagnostics** - Select **Error diagnostics** to instruct the source to produce error diagnostics that you can later reference using APIs. For more information, read the [error diagnostics overview](../../../../../ingestion/quality/error-diagnostics.md)
    * **Enable Partial Ingestion** - Partial batch ingestion is the ability to ingest data containing errors, up to a certain threshold. With this capability, users can successfully ingest all their correct data into Adobe Experience Platform while all their incorrect data is batched separately, along with details as to why it is invalid.  For more information, read the [Partial ingestion overview](../../../../../ingestion/batch-ingestion/partial.md)
* **Dataflow Details**
    * **Dataflow Name** - The name of the dataflow.  By default, this will use the name of the file that is being imported.
    * **Description (Optional)** - A brief description of your dataflow.
* **Alerts** - Adobe Experience Platform can produce event-based alerts which users can subscribe to, these options all a running dataflow to trigger these.  For more information, read the [alerts overview](../../alerts.md)
    * **Sources Dataflow Run Start** - Issues an alert when the dataflow starts.
    * **Sources Dataflow Run Success** - Issues an alert when the dataflow ends without error.
    * **Sources Dataflow Run Failure** - Issues an alert when the dataflow ends with a failure status.

## Mapping

Use the mapping interface to map your source data to the appropriate schema fields before ingesting data to Experience Platform.  For more information, read the [mapping guide in the UI](../../../../../data-prep/ui/mapping.md)

<br>![Mapping](../../../../images/tutorials/create/acxiom-prospect-suppression-data-sourcing/image-source-mapping.png)

## Schedule your dataflow ingestion
Use the scheduling interface to define the ingestion schedule of your dataflow.

* **Frequency** - Indicates how often the flow should be run, once a week, day, hour, minute.  Or simply to only run once.
* **Interval** - When a Frequency is selected other than once, interval to establish a set time frame between every ingestion. For example, an ingestion frequency set to Day and an interval set to 15 means that your dataflow is scheduled to ingest data every 15 days.
* **Start Time** - The timestamp for the projected run, presented in UTC time zone.
* **Backfill** - A boolean value that determines what data is initially ingested. If backfill is enabled, all current files in the specified path will be ingested during the first scheduled ingestion. If backfill is disabled, only the files that are loaded in between the first run of ingestion and the start time will be ingested. Files loaded prior to start time will not be ingested.

## Review your dataflow
Use the review page for a summary of your dataflow prior to ingestion. Details are grouped in the following categories:

* **Connection** - Shows the source type, the relevant path of the chosen source file, and the amount of columns within that source file.
* **Assign dataset & map fields** - Shows which dataset the source data is being ingested into, including the schema that the dataset adheres to.
* **Scheduling** - Shows that active period, frequency, and interval of the ingestion schedule.
  Once you have reviewed your dataflow, click Finish and allow some time for the dataflow to be created.
