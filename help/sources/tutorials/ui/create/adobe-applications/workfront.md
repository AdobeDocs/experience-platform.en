# Create an Adobe Workfront source connection in the UI

This tutorial provides steps for creating an Adobe Workfront source connection in the UI to bring Adobe Workfront data into Adobe Experience Platform.

## Getting started

This tutorial requires a working understanding of the following components of Experience Platform:

* [Experience Data Model (XDM) System](../../../../../xdm/home.md): The standardized framework by which Experience Platform organizes customer experience data.
* [Real-time Customer Profile](../../../../../profile/home.md): Provides a unified, real-time consumer profile based on aggregated data from multiple sources.
* [Sandboxes](../../../../../sandboxes/home.md): Experience Platform provides virtual sandboxes which partition a single Platform instance into separate virtual environments to help develop and evolve digital experience applications.
