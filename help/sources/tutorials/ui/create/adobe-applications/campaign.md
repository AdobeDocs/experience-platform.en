# Create an Adobe Campaign Managed Services source connection using Platform UI

This tutorial provides steps to create a source connector to bring your Adobe Campaign Managed Services data to Adobe Experience Platform.

## Getting started

This guide requires a working understanding of the following components of Experience Platform:

* [Sources](../../../../home.md): Platform allows data to be ingested from various sources while providing you with the ability to structure, label, and enhance incoming data using [!DNL Platform] services.
* [Sandboxes](../../../../../sandboxes/home.md): Platform provides virtual sandboxes which partition a single Platform instance into separate virtual environments to help develop and evolve digital experience applications.

## Connect Adobe Campaign Managed Services to Platform

In the Platform UI, select **[!UICONTROL Sources]** from the left navigation to access the [!UICONTROL Sources] workspace. The [!UICONTROL Catalog] screen displays a variety of sources that you can create an account with.

You can select the appropriate category from the catalog on the left-hand side of your screen. You can also use the search bar to narrow down the displayed sources.

Under the **[!UICONTROL Adobe applications]** category, select **[!UICONTROL Adobe Campaign Managed Services]** and then select **[!UICONTROL Add data]**.

### Select data

The [!UICONTROL Select data] step appears, providing you with an interface to configure values for your [!UICONTROL Adobe Campaign instance], [!UICONTROL Target mapping], and [!UICONTROL Schema name].

#### Select campaign instance {#select-campaign-instance}
