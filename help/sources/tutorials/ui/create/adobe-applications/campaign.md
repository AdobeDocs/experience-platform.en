# Create an Adobe Campaign Managed Services source connection using Platform UI

This tutorial provides steps to create a source connector to bring your Adobe Campaign Managed Services data to Adobe Experience Platform.

## Getting started

This guide requires a working understanding of the following components of Experience Platform:

* [Sources](../../../../home.md): Platform allows data to be ingested from various sources while providing you with the ability to structure, label, and enhance incoming data using [!DNL Platform] services.
* [Sandboxes](../../../../../sandboxes/home.md): Platform provides virtual sandboxes which partition a single Platform instance into separate virtual environments to help develop and evolve digital experience applications.

## Connect Adobe Campaign Managed Services to Platform

In the Platform UI, select **[!UICONTROL Sources]** from the left navigation to access the [!UICONTROL Sources] workspace. The [!UICONTROL Catalog] screen displays a variety of sources that you can create an account with.

You can select the appropriate category from the catalog on the left-hand side of your screen. You can also use the search bar to narrow down the displayed sources.

Under the **[!UICONTROL Adobe applications]** category, select **[!UICONTROL Adobe Campaign Managed Services]** and then select **[!UICONTROL Add data]**.

### Select data {#select-data}

>[!CONTEXTUALHELP]
>id="platform_sources_campaign_instance"
>title="ACC Instance"
>abstract="The name of the Adobe Campaign Classic environment that you want to use."
>text="Learn more in documentation"

>[!CONTEXTUALHELP]
>id="platform_sources_campaign_mapping"
>title="Target mapping"
>abstract="Target mappings are technical objects used by Campaign in order to deliver messages, and contain all the technical settings required to send deliveries (addresses, phone numbers, opt-in indicators, additional identifiers…)."
>text="Learn more in documentation"

>[!CONTEXTUALHELP]
>id="platform_sources_campaign_schema"
>title="Schema name"
>abstract="The name of the entity defined in the Adobe Campaign database."
>text="Learn more in documentation"

The [!UICONTROL Select data] step appears, providing you with an interface to configure values for your [!UICONTROL Adobe Campaign instance], [!UICONTROL Target mapping], and [!UICONTROL Schema name].
