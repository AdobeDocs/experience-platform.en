# (Beta) Create a [!DNL Marketo Engage] source connector in the UI

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>The [!DNL Marketo Engage] source is currently in beta. The feature and documentation are subject change. Furthermore, you must ensure that you are using a non-production sandbox when using the connector during the beta program. For more information on sandboxes, please refer to the [Sandboxes documentation](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-platform/sandbox/home.html?lang=en#understanding-sandboxes).

This tutorial provides steps for creating a [!DNL Marketo Engage] (hereinafter referred to as "[!DNL Marketo]") source connector in the UI to bring consumer data into Adobe Experience Platform.

## Getting started

This tutorial requires a working understanding of the following components of Adobe Experience Platform:

* [Sources](../../../../home.md): Experience Platform allows data to be ingested from various sources while providing you with the ability to structure, label, and enhance incoming data using Platform services.
* [Experience Data Model (XDM)](../../../../../xdm/home.md): The standardized framework by which Experience Platform organizes customer experience data.
  * [Create and edit schemas in the UI](../../../../../xdm/ui/resources/schemas.md): Learn how to create and edit schemas in the UI.
* [Identity namespaces](../../../../../identity-service/namespaces.md): Identity namespaces are a component of [!DNL Identity Service] that serve as indicators of the context to which an identity relates. A fully qualified identity includes an ID value and a namespace.
* [[!DNL Real-time Customer Profile]](/help/profile/home.md): Provides a unified, real-time consumer profile based on aggregated data from multiple sources.
* [Sandboxes](../../../../../sandboxes/home.md): Experience Platform provides virtual sandboxes which partition a single Platform instance into separate virtual environments to help develop and evolve digital experience applications.

### Gather required credentials

In order to access your [!DNL Marketo] account on Platform, you must provide the following values:

| Credential | Description |
| ---------- | ----------- |
| `munchkinId` |  The Munchkin ID is the unique identifier for a specific [!DNL Marketo] instance. |
| `clientId` | The unique client ID of your [!DNL Marketo] instance. |
| `clientSecret` | The unique client secret of your [!DNL Marketo] instance. |

For more information on acquiring these values, refer to the [[!DNL Marketo] authentication guide](../../../../connectors/adobe-applications/marketo/marketo-auth.md).

Once you have gathered your required credentials, you can follow the steps in the next section.

## Connect your [!DNL Marketo] account

In the Platform UI, select **[!UICONTROL Sources]** from the left navigation bar to access the [!UICONTROL Sources] workspace. The [!UICONTROL Catalog] screen displays a variety of sources for which you can create an account with.

You can select the appropriate category from the catalog on the left-hand side of your screen. Alternatively, you can find the specific source you wish to work with using the search bar.

Under the [!UICONTROL Adobe applications] category, select **[!UICONTROL Marketo Engage]**. Then, select **[!UICONTROL Add data]** to create a new [!DNL Marketo] dataflow.

![catalog](../../../../images/tutorials/create/marketo/catalog.png)

The **[!UICONTROL Connect to Marketo Engage]** page appears. On this page, you can either use a new account or access an existing account.

### New account

If you are creating a new account, select **[!UICONTROL New account]**. On the input form that appears, provide an account name, an optional description, and your [!DNL Marketo] authentication credentials. When finished, select **[!UICONTROL Connect to source]** and then allow some time for the new connection to establish.

![new-account](../../../../images/tutorials/create/marketo/new.png)

### Existing account

To create a dataflow with an existing account, select **[!UICONTROL Existing account]** and then select the [!DNL Marketo] account you want to use. Select **[!UICONTROL Next]** to proceed.

![existing](../../../../images/tutorials/create/marketo/existing.png)

## Select a dataset

After creating your [!DNL Marketo] account, the next step provides an interface for you to explore [!DNL Marketo] datasets.

The left half of the interface is a directory browser, displaying the 10 [!DNL Marketo] datasets. A fully-functioning [!DNL Marketo] source connection requires the ingestion of the nine different datasets. If you are also using the [!DNL Marketo] account-based marketing (ABM) feature, then you must also create a 10th dataflow to ingest the [!UICONTROL Named Accounts] dataset.

>[!NOTE]
>
>For the purposes of brevity, the following tutorial uses [!UICONTROL Named Accounts] as an example, but the steps outlined below apply to any of the 10 [!DNL Marketo] datasets.

Select the dataset you wish to ingest first, then select **[!UICONTROL Next]**.

![select-data](../../../../images/tutorials/create/marketo/select-data.png)

## Map [!DNL Marketo] schemas to Platform

The [!UICONTROL Mapping] step appears, providing an interface to map [!DNL Marketo] schemas to Platform.

Choose a dataset for inbound data to be ingested into. You can either use an existing dataset or create a new dataset.

### Use an existing dataset

To ingest data into an existing dataset, select **[!UICONTROL Existing dataset]**, then select the dataset icon.

![existing-dataset](../../../../images/tutorials/create/marketo/existing-dataset.png)

The **[!UICONTROL Select dataset]** dialog appears. Find the dataset with the appropriate schema you wish to use, select it, then select **[!UICONTROL Confirm]**.

![select-existing-dataset](../../../../images/tutorials/create/marketo/select-dataset.png)

### Use a new dataset

To ingest data into a new dataset, select **[!UICONTROL New dataset]** and enter a name and description for the dataset in the fields provided.

You can search for a schema by entering its name in the **[!UICONTROL Select schema]** search bar. You can also select the dropdown icon to see a list of existing schemas. Alternatively, you can select **[!UICONTROL Advanced search]** to access page of existing schemas including their respective details.

Toggle the **[!UICONTROL Profile dataset]** button to enable your target dataset for [!DNL Profile], allowing you to create a holistic view of an entity's attributes and behaviors. Data from all [!DNL Profile]-enabled datasets will be included in [!DNL Profile] and changes are applied when you save your dataflow.

![create-new-dataset](../../../../images/tutorials/create/marketo/new-dataset-schema.png)

Once you have selected a schema, scroll down to view the mapping dialog to start mapping your [!DNL Marketo] dataset fields to their appropriate target XDM fields.

### Map your [!DNL Marketo] dataset source fields to target XDM fields

Each [!DNL Marketo] dataset has its own specific mapping rules to follow. See the following for more information on how to map [!DNL Marketo] datasets to XDM:

* [Activities](../../../../connectors/adobe-applications/mapping/marketo.md#activities)
* [Programs](../../../../connectors/adobe-applications/mapping/marketo.md#programs)
* [Program memberships](../../../../connectors/adobe-applications/mapping/marketo.md#program-memberships)
* [Companies](../../../../connectors/adobe-applications/mapping/marketo.md#companies)
* [Static lists](../../../../connectors/adobe-applications/mapping/marketo.md#static-lists)
* [Static list memberships](../../../../connectors/adobe-applications/mapping/marketo.md#static-list-memberships)
* [Named Accounts](../../../../connectors/adobe-applications/mapping/marketo.md#named-accounts)
* [Opportunities](../../../../connectors/adobe-applications/mapping/marketo.md#opportunities)
* [Opportunity contact roles](../../../../connectors/adobe-applications/mapping/marketo.md#opportunity-contact-roles)
* [Persons](../../../../connectors/adobe-applications/mapping/marketo.md#persons)

Select **[!UICONTROL Preview data]** to see mapping results based on your selected dataset.

![mapping](../../../../images/tutorials/create/marketo/mapping.png)

The [!UICONTROL Preview] popover provides you an interface to explore mapping results of up to 100 rows of sample data from the selected dataset.

![preview](../../../../images/tutorials/create/marketo/mapping-preview.png)

Once your source fields are mapped to the appropriate target fields, select **[!UICONTROL Close]**.

## Provide dataflow details

The [!UICONTROL Dataflow detail] step appears, allowing you to provide a name and a brief description about your new dataflow.

![dataflow-detail](../../../../images/tutorials/create/marketo/dataflow-detail.png)

Enable the **[!UICONTROL Error diagnostics]** toggle to allow for detailed error message generation for newly ingested batches, which you can download using the API. For more information, see the tutorial on [retrieving data ingestion error diagnostics](../../../../../ingestion/quality/error-diagnostics.md).

![errors](../../../../images/tutorials/create/marketo/errors.png)

The [!DNL Marketo] connector uses batch ingestion to ingest all historical records and uses streaming ingestion for real-time updates. This allows the connector to continue streaming while ingesting any erroneous records. Enable the **[!UICONTROL Partial ingestion]** toggle and then set the [!UICONTROL Error threshold %] to maximum to prevent the dataflow from failing.

**[!UICONTROL Partial ingestion]** provides the ability to ingest data containing errors up to a certain threshold. For more information, see the [partial batch ingestion overview](../../../../../ingestion/batch-ingestion/partial.md).

Once you have provided your dataflow details and set your error threshold to max, select **[!UICONTROL Next]**.

![partial-ingestion](../../../../images/tutorials/create/marketo/partial-ingestion.png)

## Review your dataflow

The **[!UICONTROL Review]** step appears, allowing you to review your new dataflow before it is created. Details are grouped within the following categories:

* **[!UICONTROL Connection]**: Shows the source type, the relevant path of the chosen source entity, and the amount of columns within that source entity.
* **[!UICONTROL Assign dataset & map fields]**: Shows which dataset the source data is being ingested into, including the schema that the dataset adheres to.

Once you have reviewed your dataflow, select **[!UICONTROL Finish]** and allow some time for the dataflow to be created.

![review](../../../../images/tutorials/create/marketo/review.png)

## Monitor your dataflow

Once your dataflow has been created, you can monitor the data that is being ingested through it to see information on ingestion rates, success, and errors. For more information on how to monitor dataflows, see the tutorial on [monitoring dataflows in the UI](../../../../../dataflows/ui/monitor-sources.md).

## Delete your attributes

Custom attributes in datasets cannot be retroactively hidden or removed. If you want to hide or remove a custom attribute from an existing dataset, then you must create a new dataset without this custom attribute, a new XDM schema, and configure a new dataflow for the new dataset that you create. You must also disable or delete the original dataflow that consists of the dataset with the custom attribute you want to hide or remove.

## Delete your dataflow

You can delete dataflows that are no longer necessary or were incorrectly created using the **[!UICONTROL Delete]** function available in the [!UICONTROL Dataflows] workspace. For more information on how to delete dataflows, see the tutorial on [deleting dataflows in the UI](../../delete.md).

## Next steps

By following this tutorial, you have successfully created a dataflow to bring in [!DNL Marketo] data. Incoming data can now be used by downstream Platform services such as [!DNL Real-time Customer Profile] and [!DNL Data Science Workspace]. See the following documents for more details:

* [[!DNL Real-time Customer Profile] overview](/help/profile/home.md)
* [[!DNL Data Science Workspace] overview](/help/data-science-workspace/home.md)
