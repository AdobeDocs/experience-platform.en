# Create a [!DNL Pinterest Ads] source connection in the UI

>[!NOTE]
>
>The [!DNL Pinterest Ads] source is in beta. Read the [sources overview](../../../../home.md#terms-and-conditions) for more information on using beta-labelled sources.

This tutorial provides steps for creating a [!DNL Pinterest Ads] source connector using the Adobe Experience Platform user interface.

## Getting started {#getting-started}

This tutorial requires a working understanding of the following components of Experience Platform:

* [[!DNL Experience Data Model (XDM)] System](../../../../../xdm/home.md): The standardized framework by which Experience Platforrm organizes customer experience data.
  * [Basics of schema composition](../../../../../xdm/schema/composition.md): Learn about the basic building blocks of XDM schemas, including key principles and best practices in schema composition.
  * [Schema Editor tutorial](../../../../../xdm/tutorials/create-schema-ui.md): Learn how to create custom schemas using the Schema Editor UI.
* [[!DNL Real-Time Customer Profile]](../../../../../profile/home.md): Provides a unified, real-time consumer profile based on aggregated data from multiple sources.

## Prerequisites {#prerequisites}

In order to connect [!DNL Pinterest Ads] to Experience Platform, you must provide values for the following connection properties:

* The [!DNL Pinterest] access token.
* The [!DNL Pinterest] ad account ID.
* One of [!DNL Pinterest] campaign, ad group or ad ID's as required.

For more information on these connection properties, read the [[!DNL Pinterest Ads] overview](../../../../connectors/advertising/pinterest-ads.md#prerequisites).

### Create a Platform schema {#create-platform-schema}

You must also ensure that you first create a Platform schema to use for your [!DNL Pinterst Ads] source. Read the tutorial on [creating a Platform schema](../../../../../xdm/schema/composition.md) for comprehensive steps on how to create a schema.

![An example Platform schema for Pinterest Ads](../../../../images/tutorials/create/advertising/pinterest-ads/schema.png)

For a list of the fields supported by the [!DNL Pinterest] campaign, ad group and ad APIs, refer to [[!DNL Pinterest] fields](#pinterest-fields) section.

## Connect your [!DNL Pinterest Ads] account {#connect-account}

In the Platform UI, select **[!UICONTROL Sources]** from the left navigation bar to access the [!UICONTROL Sources] workspace. The [!UICONTROL Catalog] screen displays a variety of sources you can create an account with.

You can select the appropriate category from the catalog on the left-hand side of your screen. Alternatively, you can find the specific source you wish to work with using the search option.

Under the *Advertising* category, select **[!UICONTROL Pinterest Ads]**, and then select **[!UICONTROL Add data]**.

![The sources catalog on Experience Platform.](../../../../images/tutorials/create/advertising/pinterest-ads/catalog.png)

The **[!UICONTROL Connect Pinterest Ads account]** page appears. On this page, you can either use new credentials or existing credentials.

### Existing account {#existing-account}

To use an existing account, select the [!DNL Pinterest Ads] account you want to create a new dataflow with, then select **[!UICONTROL Next]** to proceed.

![The existing account step of the sources workflow.](../../../../images/tutorials/create/advertising/pinterest-ads/existing.png)

### New account {#new-account}

If you are creating a new account, select **[!UICONTROL New account]**, and then provide a name, an optional description, and your credentials. When finished, select **[!UICONTROL Connect to source]** and then allow some time for the new connection to establish.

![The new account step of the sources workflow.](../../../../images/tutorials/create/advertising/pinterest-ads/new.png)



## Select data {#select-data}

The **[!UICONTROL Select data]** step appears, providing an interface for you to input the information that would be passed to the APIs to bring the data you want to Platform.

| Field | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [!UICONTROL ad_account_id] | Your [!DNL Pinterest Ads] ad account ID. Refer to the [[!DNL Pinterest] guide on finding IDs in Ads Manager](https://help.pinterest.com/en/business/article/find-ids-in-ads-manager) if you need any guidance. |
| [!UICONTROL object_type] | Select one of **campaigns**, **ad groups** or **ads** depending on which of the [!DNL Pinterest] Analytics APIs you want to obtain information from. |
| [!UICONTROL object_ids] | The selected object's IDs. Navigate to the [!DNL Pinterest] page for **Pinterest Business Hub** > **Ad Account Summary** > **Campaigns** / **Ad Groups** / **Ads** and copy the required ID's mentioned just below each of their names. |

>[!TIP]
>
>You can provide multiple `object_ids` by passing comma-separated values. The maximum number of IDs that you can pass in a single request is 100. If incorrect values are passed, Platform displays the following message: `The request could not be processed. Error from flow provider: Unknown error while processing request.` 

After providing the values, select **[!UICONTROL Select]**. If the values provided are valid, the right part of the interface, preview data, will get populated.

![The select data step of the sources workflow.](../../../../images/tutorials/create/advertising/pinterest-ads/select-data.png)

## Next steps {#next-steps}

By following this tutorial, you have established a connection to your [!DNL Pinterest Ads] account. You can now continue on to the next tutorial and [configure a dataflow to bring advertising data into Platform](../../dataflow/advertising.md).

## Additional resources {#additional-resources}

The sections below provide additional resources that you can refer to when using the [!DNL Pinterest Ads] source.

## Scheduling {#scheduling}

When scheduling your [!DNL Pinterest Ads] dataflow for ingestion, you must select one of the following frequency and interval configurations:

| Frequency | Interval |
| --- | --- |
| `Day` | 1 |
| `Hour` | 24 |

For more information on scheduling your [!DNL Pinterest Ads] dataflow, read the [guardrails section of the [!DNL Pinterest Ads] overview](../../../../connectors/advertising/pinterest-ads.md#guardrails).

Once your have provided the values for your schedule, select **[!UICONTROL Next]**.

![The scheduling step of the sources workflow.](../../../../images/tutorials/create/advertising/pinterest-ads/scheduling.png)

### Validation {#validation}

To validate that you have correctly set up the source and [!DNL Pinterest Ads] data is being ingested, follow the steps below:

In the Platform UI, select **[!UICONTROL View Dataflows]** beside the [!DNL Pinterest Ads] card menu on the catalog page. You can then select [!UICONTROL Preview dataset] to verify the data that was ingested.

![Platform UI screenshot for Pinterest Ads Preview Dataset.](../../../../images/tutorials/create/advertising/pinterest-ads/preview-dataset.png)

You can verify the data against the counts visible on the [!DNL Pinterest] UI
