# Create a Didomi source connection in the UI

## Overview

The Didomi Source Connector enables you to stream real-time user consent and preference data from the Didomi Consent & Preference Management Platform into Adobe Experience Platform (AEP).
Adobe Experience Platform supports ingesting data from a wide range of external systems including cloud storage, databases, and applications like Didomi through a system of source connectors. These connectors let you authenticate external systems, manage data flow into Adobe, and ensure consistent and structured ingestion of customer data.
This connector allows you to centralize and act on consent data in Adobe Experience Platform, keeping your customer profiles and downstream workflows compliant and up to date.
