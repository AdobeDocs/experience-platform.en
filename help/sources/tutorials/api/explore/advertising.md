# Explore an advertising system using the [!DNL Flow Service] API

With a base connection created, you can now use the unique base connection ID to navigate and explore your source's data structure and contents. This allows you to identify the specific items, and their respective data types and formats, before creating a dataflow and bringing them over to Adobe Experience Platform.

This tutorial uses the [[!DNL Flow Service] API](https://www.adobe.io/experience-platform-apis/references/flow-service/) to explore advertising systems.

## Getting started

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>
This tutorial requires you to have the unique base connection ID for your advertising source. If you do not have this ID, see the tutorial on [connecting an advertising source to Platform](../../api/create/advertising/ads.md) tutorial.

This guide requires a working understanding of the following components of Adobe Experience Platform:

* [Sources](../../../home.md): [!DNL Experience Platform] allows data to be ingested from various sources while providing you with the ability to structure, label, and enhance incoming data using [!DNL Platform] services.
* [Sandboxes](../../../../sandboxes/home.md): [!DNL Experience Platform] provides virtual sandboxes which partition a single [!DNL Platform] instance into separate virtual environments to help develop and evolve digital experience applications.

The following sections provide additional information that you will need to know in order to successfully connect to an advertising system using the [!DNL Flow Service] API.

### Using Platform APIs

For information on how to successfully make calls to Platform APIs, see the guide on [getting started with Platform APIs](../../../../landing/api-guide.md).

## Explore your data tables

Using the base connection for your advertising system, you can explore your data tables by performing GET requests. Use the following call to find the path of the table you wish to inspect or ingest into [!DNL Platform].

**API format**

```https
GET /connections/{BASE_CONNECTION_ID}/explore?objectType=root
```

| Parameter | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `{BASE_CONNECTION_ID}` | The ID of the base connection for your advertising system. |

**Request**

```shell
curl -X GET \
    'https://platform.adobe.io/data/foundation/flowservice/connections/2484f2df-c057-4ab5-84f2-dfc0577ab592/explore?objectType=root' \
    -H 'Authorization: Bearer {ACCESS_TOKEN}' \
    -H 'x-api-key: {API_KEY}' \
    -H 'x-gw-ims-org-id: {IMS_ORG}' \
    -H 'x-sandbox-name: {SANDBOX_NAME}'
```

**Response**

A successful response is an array of tables from to your advertising system. Find the table you wish to bring into [!DNL Platform] and take note of its `path` property, as you are required to provide it in the next step to inspect its structure.

```json
[
    {
        "type": "table",
        "name": "v201809.ACCOUNT_PERFORMANCE_REPORT",
        "path": "v201809.ACCOUNT_PERFORMANCE_REPORT",
        "canPreview": true,
        "canFetchSchema": true
    },
    {
        "type": "table",
        "name": "v201809.ADGROUP_PERFORMANCE_REPORT",
        "path": "v201809.ADGROUP_PERFORMANCE_REPORT",
        "canPreview": true,
        "canFetchSchema": true
    },
    {
        "type": "table",
        "name": "v201809.AD_CUSTOMIZERS_FEED_ITEM_REPORT",
        "path": "v201809.AD_CUSTOMIZERS_FEED_ITEM_REPORT",
        "canPreview": true,
        "canFetchSchema": true
    },
    {
        "type": "table",
        "name": "v201809.AD_PERFORMANCE_REPORT",
        "path": "v201809.AD_PERFORMANCE_REPORT",
        "canPreview": true,
        "canFetchSchema": true
    }
]
```

## Inspect the structure of a table

To inspect the structure of a table from your advertising system, perform a GET request while specifying the path of a table as a query parameter.

**API format**

```http
GET /connections/{BASE_CONNECTION_ID}/explore?objectType=table&object={TABLE_PATH}
```

| Parameter | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `{BASE_CONNECTION_ID}` | The connection ID for your advertising system. |
| `{TABLE_PATH}` | The path of a table within your advertising system. |

**Request**

```shell
curl -X GET \
    'https://platform.adobe.io/data/foundation/flowservice/connections/2484f2df-c057-4ab5-84f2-dfc0577ab592/explore?objectType=table&object=v201809.AD_PERFORMANCE_REPORT' \
    -H 'Authorization: Bearer {ACCESS_TOKEN}' \
    -H 'x-api-key: {API_KEY}' \
    -H 'x-gw-ims-org-id: {IMS_ORG}' \
    -H 'x-sandbox-name: {SANDBOX_NAME}'
```

**Response**

A successful response returns the structure of a table. Details regarding each of the table's columns are located within elements of the `columns` array.

```json
{
    "format": "flat",
    "schema": {
        "columns": [
            {
                "name": "CallOnlyPhoneNumber",
                "type": "string",
                "xdm": {
                    "type": "string"
                }
            },
            {
                "name": "AdGroupId",
                "type": "long",
                "xdm": {
                    "type": "integer",
                    "minimum": -9007199254740992,
                    "maximum": 9007199254740991
                }
            },
            {
                "name": "AdGroupName",
                "type": "string",
                "xdm": {
                    "type": "string"
                }
            },
            {
                "name": "Date",
                "type": "string",
                "meta:xdmType": "date-time",
                "xdm": {
                    "type": "string",
                    "format": "date-time"
                }
            },
        ]
    }
}
```

## Next steps

By following this tutorial, you have explored your advertising system, found the path of the table you wish to bring in to [!DNL Platform], and obtained information regarding its structure. You can use this information in the next tutorial to [collect data from your advertising system and bring it into Platform](../collect/advertising.md).
