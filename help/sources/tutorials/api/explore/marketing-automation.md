# Explore a marketing automation system using the [!DNL Flow Service] API

[!DNL Flow Service] is used to collect and centralize customer data from various disparate sources within Adobe Experience Platform. The service provides a user interface and RESTful API from which all supported sources are connectable.

This tutorial uses the [!DNL Flow Service] API to explore marketing automation systems.

## Getting started

This guide requires a working understanding of the following components of Adobe Experience Platform:

*   [Sources](../../../home.md): [!DNL Experience Platform] allows data to be ingested from various sources while providing you with the ability to structure, label, and enhance incoming data using [!DNL Experience Platform] services.
*   [Sandboxes](../../../../sandboxes/home.md): [!DNL Experience Platform] provides virtual sandboxes which partition a single [!DNL Experience Platform] instance into separate virtual environments to help develop and evolve digital experience applications.

The following sections provide additional information that you will need to know in order to successfully connect to a marketing automation system using the [!DNL Flow Service] API.

### Gather required credentials

This tutorial requires you to have a valid connection with the third-party marketing automation application you wish to ingest data from. A valid connection involves your application's connection specification ID and connection ID. More information about creating an marketing automation connection and retrieving these values can be found in the [connect a marketing automation source to Platform](../../api/create/marketing-automation/hubspot.md) tutorial.

### Reading sample API calls

This tutorial provides example API calls to demonstrate how to format your requests. These include paths, required headers, and properly formatted request payloads. Sample JSON returned in API responses is also provided. For information on the conventions used in documentation for sample API calls, see the section on [how to read example API calls](../../../../landing/troubleshooting.md#how-do-i-format-an-api-request) in the [!DNL Experience Platform] troubleshooting guide.

### Gather values for required headers

In order to make calls to [!DNL Experience Platform] APIs, you must first complete the [authentication tutorial](https://www.adobe.com/go/platform-api-authentication-en). Completing the authentication tutorial provides the values for each of the required headers in all [!DNL Experience Platform] API calls, as shown below:

*   Authorization: Bearer `{ACCESS_TOKEN}`
*   x-api-key: `{API_KEY}`
*   x-gw-ims-org-id: `{ORG_ID}`

All resources in [!DNL Experience Platform], including those belonging to [!DNL Flow Service], are isolated to specific virtual sandboxes. All requests to [!DNL Experience Platform] APIs require a header that specifies the name of the sandbox the operation will take place in:

*   x-sandbox-name: `{SANDBOX_NAME}`

All requests that contain a payload (POST, PUT, PATCH) require an additional media type header:

*   Content-Type: `application/json`

## Explore your data tables

Using the base connection for your marketing automation system, you can explore your data tables by performing GET requests. Use the following call to find the path of the table you wish to inspect or ingest into [!DNL Experience Platform].

**API format**

```https
GET /connections/{BASE_CONNECTION_ID}/explore?objectType=root
```

| Parameter | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `{BASE_CONNECTION_ID}` | The ID of the base connection for your marketing automation system. |

**Request**

```shell
curl -X GET \
    'http://platform.adobe.io/data/foundation/flowservice/connections/2fce94c1-9a93-4971-8e94-c19a93097129/explore?objectType=root' \
    -H 'Authorization: Bearer {ACCESS_TOKEN}' \
    -H 'x-api-key: {API_KEY}' \
    -H 'x-gw-ims-org-id: {ORG_ID}' \
    -H 'x-sandbox-name: {SANDBOX_NAME}'
```

**Response**

A successful response is an array of tables from to your marketing automation system. Find the table you wish to bring into [!DNL Experience Platform] and take note of its `path` property, as you are required to provide it in the next step to inspect its structure.

```json
[
    {
        "type": "table",
        "name": "Hubspot.All_Deals",
        "path": "Hubspot.All_Deals",
        "canPreview": true,
        "canFetchSchema": true
    },
    {
        "type": "table",
        "name": "Hubspot.Blog_Authors",
        "path": "Hubspot.Blog_Authors",
        "canPreview": true,
        "canFetchSchema": true
    },
    {
        "type": "table",
        "name": "Hubspot.Blog_Comments",
        "path": "Hubspot.Blog_Comments",
        "canPreview": true,
        "canFetchSchema": true
    },
    {
        "type": "table",
        "name": "Hubspot.Contacts",
        "path": "Hubspot.Contacts",
        "canPreview": true,
        "canFetchSchema": true
    },
]
```

## Inspect the structure of a table

To inspect the structure of a table from your marketing automation system, perform a GET request while specifying the path of a table as a query parameter.

**API format**

```https
GET /connections/{BASE_CONNECTION_ID}/explore?objectType=table&object={TABLE_PATH}
```

| Parameter | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `{BASE_CONNECTION_ID}` | The connection ID for your marketing automation system. |
| `{TABLE_PATH}` | The path of a table within your marketing automation system. |

**Request**

```shell
curl -X GET \
    'http://platform.adobe.io/data/foundation/flowservice/connections/2fce94c1-9a93-4971-8e94-c19a93097129/explore?objectType=table&object=Hubspot.Contacts' \
    -H 'Authorization: Bearer {ACCESS_TOKEN}' \
    -H 'x-api-key: {API_KEY}' \
    -H 'x-gw-ims-org-id: {ORG_ID}' \
    -H 'x-sandbox-name: {SANDBOX_NAME}'
```

**Response**

A successful response returns the structure of a table. Details regarding each of the table's columns are located within elements of the `columns` array.

```json
{
    "format": "flat",
    "schema": {
        "columns": [
            {
                "name": "Properties_Firstname_Value",
                "type": "string",
                "xdm": {
                    "type": "string"
                }
            },
            {
                "name": "Properties_Lastname_Value",
                "type": "string",
                "xdm": {
                    "type": "string"
                }
            },
            {
                "name": "Added_At",
                "type": "string",
                "meta:xdmType": "date-time",
                "xdm": {
                    "type": "string",
                    "format": "date-time"
                }
            },
            {
                "name": "Portal_Id",
                "type": "string",
                "xdm": {
                    "type": "string"
                }
            },
        ]
    }
}
```
