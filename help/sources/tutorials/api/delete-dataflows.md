# Delete a dataflow using the Flow Service API

You can delete batch and streaming dataflows that contain errors or have become obsolete using the [[!DNL Flow Service] API](https://www.adobe.io/experience-platform-apis/references/flow-service/).

This tutorial covers the steps for deleting dataflows made with both batch and streaming sources using [!DNL Flow Service].

## Getting started

This tutorial requires you to have a valid flow ID. If you do not have a valid flow ID, select your connector of choice from the [sources overview](../../home.md) and follow the steps outlined before attempting this tutorial.

This tutorial also requires you to have a working understanding of the following components of Adobe Experience Platform:

* [Sources](../../home.md): [!DNL Experience Platform] allows data to be ingested from various sources while providing you with the ability to structure, label, and enhance incoming data using [!DNL Platform] services.
* [Sandboxes](../../../sandboxes/home.md): [!DNL Experience Platform] provides virtual sandboxes which partition a single [!DNL Platform] instance into separate virtual environments to help develop and evolve digital experience applications.

The following sections provide additional information that you will need to know in order to successfully delete a dataflow using the [!DNL Flow Service] API.

### Reading sample API calls

This tutorial provides example API calls to demonstrate how to format your requests. These include paths, required headers, and properly formatted request payloads. Sample JSON returned in API responses is also provided. For information on the conventions used in documentation for sample API calls, see the section on [how to read example API calls](../../../landing/troubleshooting.md#how-do-i-format-an-api-request) in the [!DNL Experience Platform] troubleshooting guide.

### Gather values for required headers

In order to make calls to [!DNL Platform] APIs, you must first complete the [authentication tutorial](https://www.adobe.com/go/platform-api-authentication-en). Completing the authentication tutorial provides the values for each of the required headers in all [!DNL Experience Platform] API calls, as shown below:

* `Authorization: Bearer {ACCESS_TOKEN}`
* `x-api-key: {API_KEY}`
* `x-gw-ims-org-id: {IMS_ORG}`

All resources in [!DNL Experience Platform], including those belonging to [!DNL Flow Service], are isolated to specific virtual sandboxes. All requests to [!DNL Platform] APIs require a header that specifies the name of the sandbox the operation will take place in:

* `x-sandbox-name: {SANDBOX_NAME}`

All requests that contain a payload (POST, PUT, PATCH) require an additional media type header:

* `Content-Type: application/json`

## Delete a dataflow

With an existing flow ID, you can delete a dataflow by performing a DELETE request to the [!DNL Flow Service] API.

**API format**

```http
DELETE /flows/{FLOW_ID}
```

| Parameter | Description |
| --------- | ----------- |
| `{FLOW_ID}` | The unique `id` value for the dataflow you want to delete. |

**Request**

```shell
curl -X DELETE \
    'https://platform-int.adobe.io/data/foundation/flowservice/flows/20c115bc-46e3-40f3-bfe9-fb25abe4ba76' \
    -H 'Authorization: Bearer {ACCESS_TOKEN}' \
    -H 'x-api-key: {API_KEY}' \
    -H 'x-gw-ims-org-id: {IMS_ORG}' \
    -H 'x-sandbox-name: {SANDBOX_NAME}'
```

**Response**

A successful response returns HTTP status 204 (No Content) and a blank body. You can confirm the deletion by attempting a lookup (GET) request to the dataflow. The API will return an HTTP 404 (Not Found) error, indicating that the dataflow has been deleted.

## Next steps

By following this tutorial, you have successfully used the [!DNL Flow Service] API to to delete an existing dataflow.

For steps on how to perform these operations using the user interface, please refer to the tutorial on [deleting dataflows in the UI](../../tutorials/ui/delete.md)
