# Collect cloud storage data using source connectors and APIs

This tutorial covers the steps for retrieving data from a third-party cloud storage and bringing them in to Platform through source connectors and the [[!DNL Flow Service] API](https://www.adobe.io/apis/experienceplatform/home/api-reference.html#!acpdr/swagger-specs/flow-service.yaml).

## Getting started

This tutorial requires you to have access to a third-party cloud storage through a valid connection and information about the file you wish to bring into Platform, including the file's path and structure. If you do not have this information, see the tutorial on [exploring a third party cloud storage using the [!DNL Flow Service] API](../explore/cloud-storage.md) before attempting this tutorial.

This tutorial also requires you to have a working understanding of the following components of Adobe Experience Platform:

- [[!DNL Experience Data Model (XDM) System]](../../../../xdm/home.md): The standardized framework by which Experience Platform organizes customer experience data.
  - [Basics of schema composition](../../../../xdm/schema/composition.md): Learn about the basic building blocks of XDM schemas, including key principles and best practices in schema composition.
  - [Schema Registry developer guide](../../../../xdm/api/getting-started.md): Includes important information that you need to know in order to successfully perform calls to the Schema Registry API. This includes your `{TENANT_ID}`, the concept of "containers", and the required headers for making requests (with special attention to the Accept header and its possible values).
- [[!DNL Catalog Service]](../../../../catalog/home.md): Catalog is the system of record for data location and lineage within Experience Platform.
- [[!DNL Batch ingestion]](../../../../ingestion/batch-ingestion/overview.md): The Batch Ingestion API allows you to ingest data into Experience Platform as batch files.
- [Sandboxes](../../../../sandboxes/home.md): Experience Platform provides virtual sandboxes which partition a single Platform instance into separate virtual environments to help develop and evolve digital experience applications.
The following sections provide additional information that you will need to know in order to successfully connect to a cloud storage using the [!DNL Flow Service] API.

### Reading sample API calls

This tutorial provides example API calls to demonstrate how to format your requests. These include paths, required headers, and properly formatted request payloads. Sample JSON returned in API responses is also provided. For information on the conventions used in documentation for sample API calls, see the section on [how to read example API calls](../../../../landing/troubleshooting.md#how-do-i-format-an-api-request) in the Experience Platform troubleshooting guide.

### Gather values for required headers

In order to make calls to Platform APIs, you must first complete the [authentication tutorial](https://www.adobe.com/go/platform-api-authentication-en). Completing the authentication tutorial provides the values for each of the required headers in all Experience Platform API calls, as shown below:

- `Authorization: Bearer {ACCESS_TOKEN}`
- `x-api-key: {API_KEY}`
- `x-gw-ims-org-id: {IMS_ORG}`

All resources in Experience Platform, including those belonging to [!DNL Flow Service], are isolated to specific virtual sandboxes. All requests to Platform APIs require a header that specifies the name of the sandbox the operation will take place in:

- `x-sandbox-name: {SANDBOX_NAME}`

All requests that contain a payload (POST, PUT, PATCH) require an additional media type header:

- `Content-Type: application/json`

## Create a source connection {#source}

You can create a source connection by making a POST request to the [!DNL Flow Service] API. A source connection consists of a connection ID, a path to the source data file, and a connection spec ID.

To create a source connection, you must also define an enum value for the data format attribute.

Use the following the enum values for file-based sources:

| Data format | Enum value |
| ----------- | ---------- |
| Delimited | `delimited` |
| JSON | `json` |
| Parquet | `parquet` |

For all table-based sources, set the value to `tabular`.

- [Create a source connection using custom delimited files](#using-custom-delimited-files)
- [Create a source connection using compressed files](#using-compressed-files)

**API format**

```http
POST /sourceConnections
```

### Create a source connection using custom delimited files {#using-custom-delimited-files}

**Request**

You can ingest a delimited file with a custom delimiter by specifying a `columnDelimiter` as a property. Any single character value is a permissible column delimiter. If unprovided, a comma `(,)` is used as the default value.

The following example request creates a source connection for a delimited file type using tab-separated values.

```shell
curl -X POST \
    'https://platform.adobe.io/data/foundation/flowservice/sourceConnections' \
    -H 'Authorization: Bearer {ACCESS_TOKEN}' \
    -H 'x-api-key: {API_KEY}' \
    -H 'x-gw-ims-org-id: {IMS_ORG}' \
    -H 'x-sandbox-name: {SANDBOX_NAME}' \
    -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    -d '{
        "name": "Cloud storage source connection for delimited files",
        "description": "Cloud storage source connector",
        "baseConnectionId": "9e2541a0-b143-4d23-a541-a0b143dd2301",
        "data": {
            "format": "delimited",
            "columnDelimiter": "\t"
        },
        "params": {
            "path": "/ingestion-demos/leads/tsv_data/*.tsv",
            "recursive": "true"
        },
        "connectionSpec": {
            "id": "4c10e202-c428-4796-9208-5f1f5732b1cf",
            "version": "1.0"
        }
    }'
```

| Property | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `baseConnectionId` | The unique connection ID of the third-party cloud storage system you are accessing. |
| `data.format` | An enum value that defines the data format attribute. |
| `data.columnDelimiter` | You can use any single character column delimiter to collect flat files. This property is only required when ingesting CSV or TSV files. |
| `params.path` | The path of the source file you are accessing. |
| `connectionSpec.id` | The connection spec ID associated with your specific third-party cloud storage system. See the [appendix](#appendix) for a list of connection spec IDs. |

**Response**

A successful response returns the unique identifier (`id`) of the newly created source connection. This ID is required in a later step to create a dataflow.

```json
{
    "id": "26b53912-1005-49f0-b539-12100559f0e2",
    "etag": "\"11004d97-0000-0200-0000-5f3c3b140000\""
}
```

### Create a source connection using compressed files {#using-compressed-files}

**Request**

You can also ingest compressed JSON or delimited files by specifying its `compressionType` as a property. The list of supported compressed file types are:

- `bzip2`
- `gzip`
- `deflate`
- `zipDeflate`
- `tarGzip`
- `tar`

The following example request creates a source connection for a compressed delimited file using a `gzip` file type.

```shell
curl -X POST \
    'https://platform.adobe.io/data/foundation/flowservice/sourceConnections' \
    -H 'Authorization: Bearer {ACCESS_TOKEN}' \

            "version": "1.0"
        }
     }'
```

| Property | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `data.properties.compressionType` | Determines the compressed file type for ingestion. This property is only required when ingesting compressed JSON or delimited files. |

**Response**

A successful response returns the unique identifier (`id`) of the newly created source connection. This ID is required in a later step to create a dataflow.

```json
{
    "id": "26b53912-1005-49f0-b539-12100559f0e2",
    "etag": "\"11004d97-0000-0200-0000-5f3c3b140000\""
}
```

## Create a target XDM schema {#target-schema}

In order for the source data to be used in Platform, a target schema must be created to structure the source data according to your needs. The target schema is then used to create a Platform dataset in which the source data is contained.

A target XDM schema can be created by performing a POST request to the [Schema Registry API](https://www.adobe.io/experience-platform-apis/references/schema-registry/).

**API format**

```http
POST /schemaregistry/tenant/schemas
```

**Request**

The following example request creates an XDM schema that extends the XDM Individual Profile class.

```shell
curl -X POST \
    'https://platform.adobe.io/data/foundation/schemaregistry/tenant/schemas' \
    -H 'Authorization: Bearer {ACCESS_TOKEN}' \
    -H 'x-api-key: {API_KEY}' \
    -H 'x-gw-ims-org-id: {IMS_ORG}' \
    -H 'x-sandbox-name: {SANDBOX_NAME}' \
    -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    -d '{
        "type": "object",
        "title": "Target schema for a Cloud Storage connector",
        "description": "Target schema for a Cloud Storage connector",
        "allOf": [
            {
                "$ref": "https://ns.adobe.com/xdm/context/profile"
            },
            {
                "$ref": "https://ns.adobe.com/xdm/context/profile-person-details"
            },
            {
                "$ref": "https://ns.adobe.com/xdm/context/profile-personal-details"
            },
            {
                "$ref": "https://ns.adobe.com/xdm/context/profile-personal-details"
            }
        ],

        "meta:xdmType": "object",
        "meta:class": "https://ns.adobe.com/xdm/context/profile"
    }'
```

**Response**

A successful response returns details of the newly created schema including its unique identifier (`$id`). This ID is required in later steps to create a target dataset, mapping, and dataflow.

```json
{
    "$id": "https://ns.adobe.com/{TENANT_ID}/schemas/995dabbea86d58e346ff91bd8aa741a9f36f29b1019138d4",

```

## Create a target dataset

A target dataset can be created by performing a POST request to the [Catalog Service API](https://www.adobe.io/experience-platform-apis/references/catalog/), providing the ID of the target schema within the payload.

**API format**

```http
POST /catalog/dataSets
```

**Request**

```shell
curl -X POST \
    'https://platform.adobe.io/data/foundation/catalog/dataSets?requestDataSource=true' \
    -H 'Authorization: Bearer {ACCESS_TOKEN}' \
    -H 'x-api-key: {API_KEY}' \
    -H 'x-gw-ims-org-id: {IMS_ORG}' \
    -H 'x-sandbox-name: {SANDBOX_NAME}' \
    -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    -d '{
        "name": "Target dataset for cloud storage",
        "schemaRef": {
            "id": "https://ns.adobe.com/{TENANT_ID}/schemas/995dabbea86d58e346ff91bd8aa741a9f36f29b1019138d4",
            "contentType": "application/vnd.adobe.xed-full-notext+json; version=1"
        }
    }'
```

| Property | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `schemaRef.id` | The ID of the target XDM schema. |
| `schemaRef.contentType` | The version of the schema. This value must be set `application/vnd.adobe.xed-full-notext+json;version=1`, which returns the latest minor version of the schema. |

**Response**

A successful response returns an array containing the ID of the newly created dataset in the format `"@/datasets/{DATASET_ID}"`. The dataset ID is a read-only, system-generated string that is used to reference the dataset in API calls. The target dataset ID is required in later steps to create a target connection and a dataflow.

```json
[
    "@/dataSets/5f3c3cedb2805c194ff0b69a"
]
```

## Create a target connection {#target-connection}

A target connection represents the connection to the destination where the ingested data lands in. To create a target connection, you must provide the fixed connection spec ID associated to the Data Lake. This connection spec ID is: `c604ff05-7f1a-43c0-8e18-33bf874cb11c`.

You now have the unique identifiers a target schema a target dataset and the connection spec ID to the Data Lake. Using these identifiers, you can create a target connection using the [!DNL Flow Service] API to specify the dataset that will contain the inbound source data.

**API format**

```http
POST /targetConnections
```

**Request**

```shell
curl -X POST \
    'https://platform.adobe.io/data/foundation/flowservice/targetConnections' \
    -H 'Authorization: Bearer {ACCESS_TOKEN}' \
    -H 'x-api-key: {API_KEY}' \
    -H 'x-gw-ims-org-id: {IMS_ORG}' \
    -H 'x-sandbox-name: {SANDBOX_NAME}' \
    -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    -d '{
        "name": "Target Connection for a Cloud Storage connector",
        "description": "Target Connection for a Cloud Storage connector",
        "data": {
            "schema": {
                "id": "https://ns.adobe.com/{TENANT_ID}/schemas/995dabbea86d58e346ff91bd8aa741a9f36f29b1019138d4",
                "version": "application/vnd.adobe.xed-full+json;version=1"
            }
        },
        "params": {
            "dataSetId": "5f3c3cedb2805c194ff0b69a"
        },
            "connectionSpec": {
            "id": "c604ff05-7f1a-43c0-8e18-33bf874cb11c",
            "version": "1.0"
        }
    }'
```

| Property | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| `data.schema.id` | The `$id` of the target XDM schema. |
|`data.schema.version` | The version of the schema. This value must be set `application/vnd.adobe.xed-full+json;version=1`, which returns the latest minor version of the schema. |
| `params.dataSetId` | The ID of the target dataset. |
| `connectionSpec.id` | The fixed connection spec ID to the Data Lake. This ID is: `c604ff05-7f1a-43c0-8e18-33bf874cb11c`. |

**Response**

A successful response returns the new target connection's unique identifier (`id`). This ID is required in later steps.

```json
{
    "id": "dbc5c132-bc2a-4625-85c1-32bc2a262558",
    "etag": "\"8e000533-0000-0200-0000-5f3c40fd0000\""
}
```

## Create a mapping {#mapping}

In order for the source data to be ingested into a target dataset, it must first be mapped to the target schema the target dataset adheres to. This is achieved by performing a POST request to Conversion Service with data mappings defined within the request payload.

>[!TIP]
>
>You can map complex data types such as arrays in JSON files using a cloud storage source connector.

**API format**

```http
POST /conversion/mappingSets
```

**Request**

```shell
curl -X POST \
    'https://platform.adobe.io/data/foundation/conversion/mappingSets' \
    -H 'Authorization: Bearer {ACCESS_TOKEN}' \
    -H 'x-api-key: {API_KEY}' \
    -H 'x-gw-ims-org-id: {IMS_ORG}' \
    -H 'x-sandbox-name: {SANDBOX_NAME}' \
    -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \

        "mappings": [
            {
                "destinationXdmPath": "_id",
                "sourceAttribute": "Id",
                "identity": false,
                "identityGroup": null,
                "namespaceCode": null,
                "version": 0
            },
            {
                "destinationXdmPath": "person.name.firstName",
                "sourceAttribute": "FirstName",
                "identity": false,

                "version": 0
            }
        ]
    }'
```

| Property | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `xdmSchema` | The ID of the target XDM schema. |

**Response**

A successful response returns details of the newly created mapping including its unique identifier (`id`). This value is required in a later step to create a dataflow.

```json
{
    "id": "bf5286a9c1ad4266baca76ba3adc9366",
    "version": 0,
    "createdDate": 1597784069368,
    "modifiedDate": 1597784069368,
    "createdBy": "{CREATED_BY}",
    "modifiedBy": "{MODIFIED_BY}"
}
```

## Retrieve dataflow specifications {#specs}

A dataflow is responsible for collecting data from sources, and bringing them into Platform. In order to create a dataflow, you must first obtain the dataflow specifications that are responsible for collecting cloud storage data.

**API format**

```http
GET /flowSpecs?property=name=="CloudStorageToAEP"
```

**Request**

```shell
curl -X GET \
    'https://platform.adobe.io/data/foundation/flowservice/flowSpecs?property=name==%22CloudStorageToAEP%22' \
    -H 'x-api-key: {API_KEY}' \
    -H 'x-gw-ims-org-id: {IMS_ORG}' \
    -H 'x-sandbox-name: {SANDBOX_NAME}'
```

**Response**

A successful response returns the details of the dataflow specification responsible for bringing data from your source into Platform. The response includes the unique flow spec `id` required to create a new dataflow.

```json
{
    "items": [
        {
            "id": "9753525b-82c7-4dce-8a9b-5ccfce2b9876",

## Create a dataflow

The last step towards collecting cloud storage data is to create a dataflow. By now, you have the following required values prepared:

- [Source connection ID](#source)
- [Target connection ID](#target)
- [Mapping ID](#mapping)
- [Dataflow specification ID](#specs)

A dataflow is responsible for scheduling and collecting data from a source. You can create a dataflow by performing a POST request while providing the previously mentioned values within the payload.

To schedule an ingestion, you must first set the start time value to epoch time in seconds. Then, you must set the frequency value to one of the five options: `once`, `minute`, `hour`, `day`, or `week`. The interval value designates the period between two consecutive ingestions and creating a one-time ingestion does not require an interval to be set. For all other frequencies, the interval value must be set to equal or greater than `15`.

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>It is strongly recommended to schedule your dataflow for one-time ingestion when using the [FTP connector](../../../connectors/cloud-storage/ftp.md).

        }
    }'
```

| Property | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `flowSpec.id` | The [flow spec ID](#specs) retrieved in the previous step. |
| `sourceConnectionIds` | The [source connection ID](#source) retrieved in an earlier step. |
| `targetConnectionIds` | The [target connection ID](#target-connection) retrieved in an earlier step. |
| `transformations.params.mappingId` | The [mapping ID](#mapping) retrieved in an earlier step.|
| `scheduleParams.startTime` | The start time for the dataflow in epoch time. |
| `scheduleParams.frequency` | The frequency at which the dataflow will collect data. Acceptable values include: `once`, `minute`, `hour`, `day`, or `week`. |
| `scheduleParams.interval` | The interval designates the period between two consecutive flow runs. The interval's value should be a non-zero integer. Interval is not required when frequency is set as `once` and should be greater than or equal to `15` for other frequency values. |

**Response**

A successful response returns the ID (`id`) of the newly created dataflow.

```json
{
    "id": "dbc5c132-bc2a-4625-85c1-32bc2a262558",
    "etag": "\"8e000533-0000-0200-0000-5f3c40fd0000\""
}
```

## Monitor your dataflow

Once your dataflow has been created, you can monitor the data that is being ingested through it to see information on flow runs, completion status, and errors. For more information on how to monitor dataflows, see the tutorial on [monitoring dataflows in the API](../monitor.md)

## Next steps

By following this tutorial, you have created a source connector to collect data from your cloud storage on a scheduled basis. Incoming data can now be used by downstream Platform services such as [!DNL Real-time Customer Profile] and [!DNL Data Science Workspace]. See the following documents for more details:

- [Real-time Customer Profile overview](../../../../profile/home.md)
- [Data Science Workspace overview](../../../../data-science-workspace/home.md)
