# Create a [!DNL Salesforce Service Cloud] source connection using the [!DNL Flow Service] API

A base connection represents the authenticated connection between a source and Adobe Experience Platform.

This tutorial walks you through the steps to create a base connection for [!DNL Salesforce Service Cloud] using the [[!DNL Flow Service] API](https://www.adobe.io/apis/experienceplatform/home/api-reference.html#!acpdr/swagger-specs/flow-service.yaml).

## Getting started

This guide requires a working understanding of the following components of Adobe Experience Platform:

* [Sources](../../../../home.md): [!DNL Experience Platform] allows data to be ingested from various sources while providing you with the ability to structure, label, and enhance incoming data using [!DNL Platform] services.
* [Sandboxes](../../../../../sandboxes/home.md): [!DNL Experience Platform] provides virtual sandboxes which partition a single [!DNL Platform] instance into separate virtual environments to help develop and evolve digital experience applications.

The following sections provide additional information that you will need to know in order to successfully connect to [!DNL Salesforce Service Cloud] using the [!DNL Flow Service] API.

### Gather required credentials

In order for [!DNL Flow Service] to connect with [!DNL Salesforce Service Cloud], you must provide values for the following connection properties:

| Credential | Description |
| ---------- | ----------- |
| `username` | The username for your [!DNL Salesforce Service Cloud] user account. |
| `password` | The password for your [!DNL Salesforce Service Cloud] account. |
| `securityToken` | The security token for your [!DNL Salesforce Service Cloud] account. |
| `connectionSpec.id` | The connection specification returns a sourceâ€™s connector properties, including authentication specifications related to creating the base and source connections. The connection specification ID for [!DNL Salesforce Service Cloud] is: `b66ab34-8619-49cb-96d1-39b37ede86ea`. |

For more information about getting started refer to [this Salesforce Service Cloud document](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.api_iot.meta/api_iot/qs_auth_access_token.htm).

### Using Platform APIs

For information on how to successfully make calls to Platform APIs, see the guide on [getting started with Platform APIs](../../../../../landing/api-guide.md).

## Create a base connection

A base connection retains information between your source and Platform, including your source's authentication credentials, the current state of the connection, and your unique base connection ID. The base connection ID allows you to explore and navigate files from within your source and identify the specific items that you want to ingest, including information regarding their data types and formats.

To create a base connection ID, make a POST request to the `/connections` endpoint while providing your [!DNL Salesforce Service Cloud] authentication credentials as part of the request parameters.

**API format**

```http
POST /connections
```

**Request**

The following request creates a base connection for [!DNL Salesforce Service Cloud]:

```shell
curl -X POST \
    'https://platform.adobe.io/data/foundation/flowservice/connections' \
    -H 'Authorization: Bearer {ACCESS_TOKEN}' \
    -H 'x-api-key: {API_KEY}' \
    -H 'x-gw-ims-org-id: {IMS_ORG}' \
    -H 'x-sandbox-name: {SANDBOX_NAME}' \
    -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    -d '{
        "name": "Base connection for salesforce service cloud",
        "description": "Base connection for salesforce service cloud",
        "auth": {
            "specName": "Basic Authentication",
            "params": {
                "username": "{USERNAME}",
                "password": "{PASSWORD}",
                "securityToken": "{SECURITY_TOKEN}"
            }
        },
        "connectionSpec": {
            "id": "b66ab34-8619-49cb-96d1-39b37ede86ea",
            "version": "1.0"
        }
    }'
```

| Parameter | Description |
| --------- | ----------- |
| `auth.params.username` | The username associated with your [!DNL Salesforce Service Cloud] account. |
| `auth.params.password` | The password associated with your [!DNL Salesforce Service Cloud] account. |
| `auth.params.securityToken` | The security token associated with your [!DNL Salesforce Service Cloud] account. |
| `connectionSpec.id` | The [!DNL Salesforce Service Cloud] connection specification ID: `b66ab34-8619-49cb-96d1-39b37ede86ea` |

**Response**

A successful response returns the newly created connection, including its unique identifier (`id`). This ID is required to explore your CRM system in the next step.

```json
{
    "id": "4267c2ab-2104-474f-a7c2-ab2104d74f86",
    "etag": "\"0200f1c5-0000-0200-0000-5e4352bf0000\""
}
```

## Next steps

By following this tutorial, you have created an [!DNL Salesforce Service Cloud] connection using the [!DNL Flow Service] API, and have obtained the connection's unique ID value. You can use this connection ID in the next tutorial as you learn how to [explore customer success systems using the Flow Service API](../../explore/customer-success.md).
