# Create an [!DNL Azure Table Storage] base connection using the [!DNL Flow Service] API

>[!NOTE]
>
>The [!DNL Azure Table Storage] connector is in beta. See the [Sources overview](../../../../home.md#terms-and-conditions) for more information on using beta-labeled connectors.

A base connection represents the authenticated connection between a source and Adobe Experience Platform.

This tutorial walks you through the steps to create a base connection for [!DNL Azure Table Storage] using the [[!DNL Flow Service] API](https://www.adobe.io/experience-platform-apis/references/flow-service/).

## Getting started

This guide requires a working understanding of the following components of Adobe Experience Platform:

* [Sources](../../../../home.md): [!DNL Experience Platform] allows data to be ingested from various sources while providing you with the ability to structure, label, and enhance incoming data using [!DNL Platform] services.
* [Sandboxes](../../../../../sandboxes/home.md): [!DNL Experience Platform] provides virtual sandboxes which partition a single [!DNL Platform] instance into separate virtual environments to help develop and evolve digital experience applications.

The following sections provide additional information that you will need to know in order to successfully connect to [!DNL Azure Table Storage] using the [!DNL Flow Service] API.

### Gather required credentials

In order for [!DNL Flow Service] to connect with [!DNL Azure Table Storage], you must provide values for the following connection properties:

| Credential | Description |
| ---------- | ----------- |
| `connectionString` | The connection string used to connect to an [!DNL Azure Table Storage] instance. The connection string pattern for [!DNL Azure Table Storage] is: `DefaultEndpointsProtocol=https;AccountName={ACCOUNT_NAME};AccountKey={ACCOUNT_KEY}`. |
| `connectionSpec.id` | The connection specification returns a source's connector properties, including authentication specifications related to creating the base and source connections. The connection specification ID for [!DNL Azure Table Storage] is `ecde33f2-c56f-46cc-bdea-ad151c16cd69`. |

For more information about obtaining a connection string, refer to [this [!DNL Azure Table Storage] document](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/storage-introduction).

### Using Platform APIs

For information on how to successfully make calls to Platform APIs, see the guide on [getting started with Platform APIs](../../../../../landing/api-guide.md).

## Create a base connection

A base connection retains information between your source and Platform, including your source's authentication credentials, the current state of the connection, and your unique base connection ID. The base connection ID allows you to explore and navigate files from within your source and identify the specific items that you want to ingest, including information regarding their data types and formats.

To create a base connection ID, make a POST request to the `/connections` endpoint while providing your [!DNL Azure Table Storage] authentication credentials as part of the request parameters.

**API format**

```http
POST /connections
```

**Request**

The following request creates a base connection for [!DNL Azure Table Storage]:

```shell
curl -X POST \
    'https://platform.adobe.io/data/foundation/flowservice/connections' \
    -H 'Authorization: Bearer {ACCESS_TOKEN}' \
    -H 'x-api-key: {API_KEY}' \
    -H 'x-gw-ims-org-id: {ORG_ID}' \
    -H 'x-sandbox-name: {SANDBOX_NAME}' \
    -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    -d '{
        "name": "Azure Table Storage connection",
        "description": "Azure Table Storage connection",
        "auth": {
            "specName": "Connection String Based Authentication",
            "params": {
                "connectionString": "DefaultEndpointsProtocol=https;AccountName={ACCOUNT_NAME};AccountKey={ACCOUNT_KEY}"
            }
        },
        "connectionSpec": {
            "id": "ecde33f2-c56f-46cc-bdea-ad151c16cd69",
            "version": "1.0"
        }
    }'
```

| Parameter | Description |
| --------- | ----------- |
| `auth.params.connectionString` | The connection string used to connect to an [!DNL Azure Table Storage] instance. The connection string pattern for [!DNL Azure Table Storage] is: `DefaultEndpointsProtocol=https;AccountName={ACCOUNT_NAME};AccountKey={ACCOUNT_KEY}`. |
| `connectionSpec.id` | The [!DNL Azure Table Storage] connection specification ID: `ecde33f2-c56f-46cc-bdea-ad151c16cd69`. |

**Response**

A successful response returns details of the newly created connection, including its unique identifier (`id`). This ID is required to explore your data in the next tutorial.

```json
{
    "id": "82abddb3-d59a-436c-abdd-b3d59a436c21",
    "etag": "\"7d00fde3-0000-0200-0000-5e84d9430000\""
}
```

## Next steps

By following this tutorial, you have created an [!DNL Azure Table Storage] base connection using the [!DNL Flow Service] API. You can use this base connection ID in the following tutorials:
