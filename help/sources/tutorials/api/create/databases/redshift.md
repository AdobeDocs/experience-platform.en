# Create an [!DNL Amazon Redshift] base connection using the [!DNL Flow Service] API

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>The [!DNL Amazon Redshift] source is available in the sources catalog to users who have purchased Real-Time Customer Data Platform Ultimate.

A base connection represents the authenticated connection between a source and Adobe Experience Platform.

This tutorial walks you through the steps to create a base connection for [!DNL Amazon Redshift] using the [[!DNL Flow Service] API](https://www.adobe.io/experience-platform-apis/references/flow-service/).

## Getting started

This guide requires a working understanding of the following components of Adobe Experience Platform:

* [Sources](../../../../home.md): [!DNL Experience Platform] allows data to be ingested from various sources while providing you with the ability to structure, label, and enhance incoming data using [!DNL Platform] services.
* [Sandboxes](../../../../../sandboxes/home.md): [!DNL Experience Platform] provides virtual sandboxes which partition a single [!DNL Platform] instance into separate virtual environments to help develop and evolve digital experience applications.

The following sections provide additional information that you will need to know in order to successfully connect to [!DNL Amazon Redshift] using the [!DNL Flow Service] API.

### Gather required credentials

In order for [!DNL Flow Service] to connect with [!DNL Amazon Redshift], you must provide the following connection properties:

| **Credential** | **Description** |
| -------------- | --------------- |
| `server` | The server associated with your [!DNL Amazon Redshift] account. |
| `port` | The TCP port that a [!DNL Amazon Redshift] server uses to listen for client connections. |
| `username` | The username associated with your [!DNL Amazon Redshift] account. |
| `password` | The password associated with your [!DNL Amazon Redshift] account. |
| `database` | The [!DNL Amazon Redshift] database you are accessing. |
| `connectionSpec.id` | The connection specification returns a source's connector properties, including authentication specifications related to creating the base and source connections. The connection specification ID for [!DNL Amazon Redshift] is `3416976c-a9ca-4bba-901a-1f08f66978ff`. |

For more information about getting started, refer to this [[!DNL Amazon Redshift] document](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/gsg/getting-started.html).

### Using Platform APIs

For information on how to successfully make calls to Platform APIs, see the guide on [getting started with Platform APIs](../../../../../landing/api-guide.md).

## Create a base connection

>[!NOTE]
>
>The default encoding standard for [!DNL Redshift] is Unicode. This cannot be changed.

A base connection retains information between your source and Platform, including your source's authentication credentials, the current state of the connection, and your unique base connection ID. The base connection ID allows you to explore and navigate files from within your source and identify the specific items that you want to ingest, including information regarding their data types and formats.

To create a base connection ID, make a POST request to the `/connections` endpoint while providing your [!DNL Amazon Redshift] authentication credentials as part of the request parameters.

**API format**

```https
POST /connections
```

**Request**

The following request creates a base connection for [!DNL Amazon Redshift]:

```shell
curl -X POST \
  'https://platform.adobe.io/data/foundation/flowservice/connections' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer {ACCESS_TOKEN}' \
  -H 'x-api-key: {API_KEY}' \
  -H 'x-gw-ims-org-id: {ORG_ID}' \
  -H 'x-sandbox-name: {SANDBOX_NAME}' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
      "name": "amazon-redshift base connection",
      "description": "base connection for amazon-redshift,
      "auth": {
          "specName": "Basic Authentication",
          "params": {
              "server": "{SERVER}",
              "port": "{PORT},
              "username": "{USERNAME}",
              "password": "{PASSWORD}",
              "database": "{DATABASE}"
          }
      },
      "connectionSpec": {
          "id": "3416976c-a9ca-4bba-901a-1f08f66978ff",
          "version": "1.0"
      }
  }'
```

| Property | Description |
| ------------- | --------------- |
| `auth.params.server` |  Your [!DNL Amazon Redshift] server. |
| `auth.params.port` | The TCP port that the [!DNL Amazon Redshift] server uses to listen for client connections. |
| `auth.params.database` | The database associated with your [!DNL Amazon Redshift] account. |
| `auth.params.password` | The password associated with your [!DNL Amazon Redshift] account. |
| `auth.params.username` | The username associated with your [!DNL Amazon Redshift] account. |
| `connectionSpec.id` | The [!DNL Amazon Redshift] connection specification ID: `3416976c-a9ca-4bba-901a-1f08f66978ff` |

**Response**

A successful response returns the newly created connection, including its unique identifier (`id`). This ID is required to explore your data in the next tutorial.

```json
{
    "id": "373e88fc-43da-4e3c-be88-fc43da3e3c0f",
    "etag": "\"1700ce7b-0000-0200-0000-5e3b405e0000\""
}
```

## Next steps

By following this tutorial, you have created an [!DNL Amazon Redshift] base connection using the [!DNL Flow Service] API. You can use this base connection ID in the following tutorials:
