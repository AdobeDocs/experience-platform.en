# Create a [!DNL MariaDB] base connection using the [!DNL Flow Service] API

A base connection represents the authenticated connection between a source and Adobe Experience Platform.

This tutorial walks you through the steps to create a base connection for [!DNL MariaDB] using the [[!DNL Flow Service] API](https://www.adobe.io/experience-platform-apis/references/flow-service/).

## Getting started

This guide requires a working understanding of the following components of Adobe Experience Platform:

* [Sources](../../../../home.md): [!DNL Experience Platform] allows data to be ingested from various sources while providing you with the ability to structure, label, and enhance incoming data using [!DNL Platform] services.
* [Sandboxes](../../../../../sandboxes/home.md): [!DNL Experience Platform] provides virtual sandboxes which partition a single [!DNL Platform] instance into separate virtual environments to help develop and evolve digital experience applications.

The following sections provide additional information that you will need to know in order to successfully connect to [!DNL MariaDB] using the [!DNL Flow Service] API.

### Gather required credentials

In order for [!DNL Flow Service] to connect with [!DNL MariaDB], you must provide the following connection property:

| Credential | Description |
| ---------- | ----------- |
| `connectionString` | The connection string associated with your [!DNL MariaDB] authentication. The [!DNL MariaDB] connection string pattern is: `Server={HOST};Port={PORT};Database={DATABASE};UID={USERNAME};PWD={PASSWORD}`. |
| `connectionSpec.id` | The connection specification returns a sourceâ€™s connector properties, including authentication specifications related to creating the base and source connections. The connection specification ID for [!DNL MariaDB] is `3000eb99-cd47-43f3-827c-43caf170f015`. |

For more information about obtaining a connection string, refer to this [[!DNL MariaDB] document](https://mariadb.com/kb/en/about-mariadb-connector-odbc/).

### Using Platform APIs

For information on how to successfully make calls to Platform APIs, see the guide on [getting started with Platform APIs](../../../../../landing/api-guide.md).

## Create a base connection

A base connection retains information between your source and Platform, including your source's authentication credentials, the current state of the connection, and your unique base connection ID. The base connection ID allows you to explore and navigate files from within your source and identify the specific items that you want to ingest, including information regarding their data types and formats.

To create a base connection ID, make a POST request to the `/connections` endpoint while providing your [!DNL MariaDB] authentication credentials as part of the request parameters.

**API format**

```https
POST /connections
```

**Request**

The following request creates a base connection for [!DNL MariaDB]:

```shell
curl -X POST \
    'https://platform.adobe.io/data/foundation/flowservice/connections' \
    -H 'Authorization: Bearer {ACCESS_TOKEN}' \
    -H 'x-api-key: {API_KEY}' \
    -H 'x-gw-ims-org-id: {IMS_ORG}' \
    -H 'x-sandbox-name: {SANDBOX_NAME}' \
    -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    -d '{
        "name": "Test connection for maria-db",
        "description": "Test connection for maria-db",
        "auth": {
            "specName": "Connection String Based Authentication",
            "params": {
                "connectionString": "Server={HOST};Port={PORT};Database={DATABASE};UID={USERNAME};PWD={PASSWORD}"
            }
        },
        "connectionSpec": {
            "id": "3000eb99-cd47-43f3-827c-43caf170f015",
            "version": "1.0"
        }
    }'
```

| Property | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| `auth.params.connectionString` | The connection string associated with your [!DNL MariaDB] authentication. The [!DNL MariaDB] connection string pattern is: `Server={HOST};Port={PORT};Database={DATABASE};UID={USERNAME};PWD={PASSWORD}`. |
| `connectionSpec.id` | The [!DNL MariaDB] connection specification ID is: `3000eb99-cd47-43f3-827c-43caf170f015`. |

**Response**

A successful response returns details of the newly created base connection, including its unique identifier (`id`). This ID is required to explore your database in the next step.

```json
{
    "id": "be3a2d71-1fb6-4fea-ba2d-711fb61fea50",
    "etag": "\"02002624-0000-0200-0000-5e41f7040000\""
}
```

## Next steps

By following this tutorial, you have created a [!DNL MariaDB] connection using the [!DNL Flow Service] API, and have obtained the connection's unique ID value. You can use this connection ID in the next tutorial as you learn how to [explore databases or NoSQL systems using the Flow Service API](../../explore/database-nosql.md).
