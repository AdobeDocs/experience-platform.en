# Create a source connection and dataflow for [!DNL Oracle NetSuite Activities] using the Flow Service API

>[!NOTE]
>
>The [!DNL Oracle NetSuite Activities] source is in beta. See the [sources overview](../../../../home.md#terms-and-conditions) for more information on using beta-labeled sources.

Read the following tutorial to learn how to bring events data from your [!DNL Oracle NetSuite Activities] account to Adobe Experience Platform using the [[!DNL Flow Service] API](https://www.adobe.io/experience-platform-apis/references/flow-service/).

## Getting started

This guide requires a working understanding of the following components of Experience Platform:

* [Sources](../../../../home.md): Experience Platform allows data to be ingested from various sources while providing you with the ability to structure, label, and enhance incoming data using Platform services.
* [Sandboxes](../../../../../sandboxes/home.md): Experience Platform provides virtual sandboxes which partition a single Platform instance into separate virtual environments to help develop and evolve digital experience applications.

The following sections provide additional information that you will need to know in order to successfully connect to [!DNL Oracle NetSuite Activities] using the [!DNL Flow Service] API.

### Authentication

Read the [[!DNL Oracle NetSuite] overview](../../../../connectors/marketing-automation/oracle-netsuite.md) for information on how to retrieve your authentication credentials.

### Using Platform APIs

For information on how to successfully make calls to Platform APIs, see the guide on [getting started with Platform APIs](../../../../../landing/api-guide.md).

## Connect [!DNL Oracle NetSuite Activities] to Platform using the [!DNL Flow Service] API

Follow the guide below to learn how to authenticate your [!DNL Oracle NetSuite Activities] source, create a source connection, and create a dataflow to bring your events data to Experience Platform.

### Create a base connection {#base-connection}

A base connection retains information between your source and Experience Platform, including your source's authentication credentials, the current state of the connection, and your unique base connection ID. The base connection ID allows you to explore and navigate files from within your source and identify the specific items that you want to ingest, including information regarding their data types and formats.

To create a base connection ID, make a POST request to the `/connections` endpoint while providing your [!DNL Oracle NetSuite Activities] authentication credentials as part of the request body.

**API format**

```https
POST /connections
```

**Request**

The following request creates a base connection for [!DNL Oracle NetSuite Activities]:

```shell
curl -X POST \
  'https://platform.adobe.io/data/foundation/flowservice/connections' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer {ACCESS_TOKEN}' \
  -H 'x-api-key: {API_KEY}' \
  -H 'x-gw-ims-org-id: {ORG_ID}' \
  -H 'x-sandbox-name: {SANDBOX_NAME}' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
      "name": "Oracle NeSuite Activities base connection",
      "description": "Authenticated base connection for Oracle NetSuite Activities",
      "connectionSpec": {
          "id": "fdf850b4-5a8d-4a5a-9ce8-4caef9abb2a8",
          "version": "1.0"
      },
      "auth": {
          "specName": "OAuth2 Client Credential",
          "params": {
              "clientId": "{CLIENT_ID}",
              "clientSecret": "{CLIENT_SECRET}"
              "accessTokenUrl": "{ACCESS_TOKEN_URL}",
              "accessToken": "{ACCESS_TOKEN_URL}"
          }
      }
  }'
```

| Property | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `name` | The name of your base connection. Ensure that the name of your base connection is descriptive as you can use this to look up information on your base connection. |
| `description` | An optional value that you can include to provide more information on your base connection. |
| `connectionSpec.id` | The connection specification ID of your source. This ID can be retrieved after your source is registered and approved through the [!DNL Flow Service] API. |
| `auth.specName` | The authentication type that you are using to authenticate your source to Platform. |
| `auth.params.clientId` | The Client ID value when you create the integration record. The process to create an interation record can be found [here](https://docs.oracle.com/en/cloud/saas/netsuite/ns-online-help/section_157771733782.html#procedure_157838925981). The value is a 64 characters string similar to `7fce.....b42f`. |
| `auth.params.clientSecret` | The Client ID value when you create the integration record. The process to create an interation record can be found [here](https://docs.oracle.com/en/cloud/saas/netsuite/ns-online-help/section_157771733782.html#procedure_157838925981). The value is a 64 characters string similar to `5c98.....1b46`. |
| `auth.params.accessTokenUrl` | The [!DNL NetSuite] Access Token URL, similar to `https://{ACCOUNT_ID}.suitetalk.api.netsuite.com/services/rest/auth/oauth2/v1/token` where you will replace ACCOUNT_ID with your [!DNL NetSuite] Account ID. |
| `auth.params.accessToken` | The Access token value is generated at the end of [Step Two](https://docs.oracle.com/en/cloud/saas/netsuite/ns-online-help/section_158081952044.html#Step-Two-POST-Request-to-the-Token-Endpoint) of the [OAuth 2.0 Authorization Code Grant Flow](https://docs.oracle.com/en/cloud/saas/netsuite/ns-online-help/section_158074210415.html#OAuth-2.0-Authorization-Code-Grant-Flow) tutorial. Access tokens expire are valid only for 60 minutes. the value is a 1024 characters string formatted as a JSON Web Token (JWT) similar to `eyJr......f4V0`. |

**Response**

A successful response returns the newly created base connection, including its unique connection identifier (`id`). This ID is required to explore your source's file structure and contents in the next step.

```json
{
    "id": "60c81023-99b4-4aae-9c31-472397576dd2",
    "etag": "\"fa003785-0000-0200-0000-6555c5310000\""
}
```

### Explore your source {#explore}

Once you have your base connection ID, you can now exploree the content and structure of your source data by performing a GET request to the `/connections` endpoint while providing your base connection ID as a query parameter.

**API format**

```http
GET /connections/{BASE_CONNECTION_ID}/explore?objectType=rest&object={OBJECT}&fileType={FILE_TYPE}&preview={PREVIEW}&sourceParams={SOURCE_PARAMS}
```

**Request**

When performing GET requests to explore your source's file structure and contents, you must include the query parameters that are listed in the table below:

| Parameter | Description |
| --------- | ----------- |
| `{BASE_CONNECTION_ID}` | The base connection ID generated in the previous step. |
| `objectType=rest` | The type of object that you wish to explore. Currently, this value is always set to `rest`. |
| `{OBJECT}` | This parameter is required only when viewing a specific directory. Its value represents the path of the directory you wish to explore. For this source the value would be `json`. |
| `fileType=json` | The file type of the file you want to bring to Platform. Currently, `json` is the only supported file type. |
| `{PREVIEW}` | A boolean value that defines whether the contents of the connection supports preview. |
| `{SOURCE_PARAMS}` | Defines parameters for the source file you want to bring to Platform. To retrieve the accepted format-type for `{SOURCE_PARAMS}`, you must encode the entire string in base64. <br> The value is empty for [!DNL Oracle NetSuite Activities].</li></ul>|

### Create a source connection {#source-connection}

You can create a source connection by making a POST request to the `/sourceConnections` endpoint of the [!DNL Flow Service] API. A source connection consists of a connection ID, a path to the source data file, and a connection spec ID.

**API format**

```https
POST /sourceConnections
```

**Request**

The following request creates a source connection for [!DNL Oracle NetSuite Activities].

```shell
curl -X POST \
  'https://platform.adobe.io/data/foundation/flowservice/sourceConnections' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer {ACCESS_TOKEN}' \
  -H 'x-api-key: {API_KEY}' \
  -H 'x-gw-ims-org-id: {ORG_ID}' \
  -H 'x-sandbox-name: {SANDBOX_NAME}' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
      "name": "Oracle NetSuite Activities Source Connection",
      "description": "Oracle NetSuite Activities Source Connection",
      "baseConnectionId": "60c81023-99b4-4aae-9c31-472397576dd2",
      "connectionSpec": {
          "id": "fdf850b4-5a8d-4a5a-9ce8-4caef9abb2a8",
          "version": "1.0"
      },
      "data": {
          "format": "json"
      },
      "params": {
      }
  }'
```

| Property | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `name` | The name of your source connection. Ensure that the name of your source connection is descriptive as you can use this to look up information on your source connection. |
| `description` | An optional value that you can include to provide more information on your source connection. |
| `baseConnectionId` | The base connection ID of [!DNL Oracle NetSuite Activities]. This ID was generated in an earlier step. |
| `connectionSpec.id` | The connection specification ID that corresponds to your source. |
| `data.format` | The format of the [!DNL Oracle NetSuite Activities] data that you want to ingest. Currently, the only supported data format is `json`. |

A successful response returns the unique identifier (`id`) of the newly created source connection. This ID is required in a later step to create a dataflow.

```json
{
    "id": "574c049f-29fc-411f-be0d-f80002025f51",
    "etag": "\"0704acb3-0000-0200-0000-6555c5470000\""
}
```

### Create a target XDM schema {#target-schema}

In order for the source data to be used in Platform, a target schema must be created to structure the source data according to your needs. The target schema is then used to create a Platform dataset in which the source data is contained.

A target XDM schema can be created by performing a POST request to the [Schema Registry API](https://developer.adobe.com/experience-platform-apis/references/schema-registry/).

For detailed steps on how to create a target XDM schema, see the tutorial on [creating a schema using the API](../../../../../xdm/api/schemas.md#create-a-schema).

### Create a target dataset {#target-dataset}

A target dataset can be created by performing a POST request to the [Catalog Service API](https://www.adobe.io/apis/experienceplatform/home/api-reference.html#!acpdr/swagger-specs/catalog.yaml), providing the ID of the target schema within the payload.

For detailed steps on how to create a target dataset, see the tutorial on [creating a dataset using the API](../../../../../catalog/api/create-dataset.md).

### Create a target connection {#target-connection}

A target connection represents the connection to the destination where the ingested data is to be stored. To create a target connection, you must provide the fixed connection spec ID that corresponds to the data lake. This ID is: `c604ff05-7f1a-43c0-8e18-33bf874cb11c`.

You now have the unique identifiers a target schema a target dataset and the connection spec ID to the data lake. Using these identifiers, you can create a target connection using the [!DNL Flow Service] API to specify the dataset that will contain the inbound source data.

**API format**

```https
POST /targetConnections
```

**Request**

The following request creates a target connection for [!DNL Oracle NetSuite Activities]:

```shell
curl -X POST \
  'https://platform.adobe.io/data/foundation/flowservice/targetConnections' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer {ACCESS_TOKEN}' \
  -H 'x-api-key: {API_KEY}' \
  -H 'x-gw-ims-org-id: {ORG_ID}' \

}
```

### Create a mapping {#mapping}

In order for the source data to be ingested into a target dataset, it must first be mapped to the target schema that the target dataset adheres to. This is achieved by performing a POST request to [[!DNL Data Prep] API](https://www.adobe.io/experience-platform-apis/references/data-prep/) with data mappings defined within the request payload.

**API format**

```http
POST /conversion/mappingSets
```

**Request**

The following request creates a mapping for [!DNL DNL NetSuite Activities]

```shell
curl -X POST \
  'https://platform.adobe.io/data/foundation/conversion/mappingSets' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer {ACCESS_TOKEN}' \
  -H 'x-api-key: {API_KEY}' \
  -H 'x-gw-ims-org-id: {ORG_ID}' \

    "version": 0,
    "createdDate": 1597784069368,
    "modifiedDate": 1597784069368,
    "createdBy": "{CREATED_BY}",
    "modifiedBy": "{MODIFIED_BY}"
}
```

### Create a flow {#flow}

The last step towards bringing data from [!DNL Oracle NetSuite Activities] to Platform is to create a dataflow. By now, you have the following required values prepared:

* [Source connection ID](#source-connection)
* [Target connection ID](#target-connection)
* [Mapping ID](#mapping)

A dataflow is responsible for scheduling and collecting data from a source. You can create a dataflow by performing a POST request while providing the previously mentioned values within the payload.

**API format**

```http
POST /flows
```

**Request**

```shell
curl -X POST \
  'https://platform.adobe.io/data/foundation/flowservice/flows' \
  -H 'x-api-key: {API_KEY}' \
  -H 'x-gw-ims-org-id: {ORG_ID}' \
  -H 'x-sandbox-name: {SANDBOX_NAME}' \

     "etag": "\"3901770b-0000-0200-0000-655708970000\""
}
```

## Appendix 

The following section provides information on the steps you can to monitor, update, and delete your dataflow.

### Monitor your dataflow

Once your dataflow has been created, you can monitor the data that is being ingested through it to see information on flow runs, completion status, and errors. For complete API examples, read the guide on [monitoring your sources dataflows using the API](../../monitor.md).

### Update your dataflow

Update the details of your dataflow, such as its name and description, as well as its run schedule and associated mapping sets by making a PATCH request to the `/flows` endpoint of [!DNL Flow Service] API, while providing the ID of your dataflow. When making a PATCH request, you must provide your dataflow's unique `etag` in the `If-Match` header. For complete API examples, read the guide on [updating sources dataflows using the API](../../update-dataflows.md).

### Update your account

Update the name, description, and credentials of your source account by performing a PATCH request to the [!DNL Flow Service] API while providing your base connection ID as a query parameter. When making a PATCH request, you must provide your source account's unique `etag` in the `If-Match` header. For complete API examples, read the guide on [updating your source account using the API](../../update.md).

### Delete your dataflow

Delete your dataflow by performing a DELETE request to the [!DNL Flow Service] API while providing the ID of the dataflow you want to delete as part of the query parameter. For complete API examples, read the guide on [deleting your dataflows using the API](../../delete-dataflows.md).

### Delete your account

Delete your account by performing a DELETE request to the [!DNL Flow Service] API while providing the base connection ID of the account you want to delete. For complete API examples, read the guide on [deleting your source account using the API](../../delete.md).
