# Create a dataflow for [!DNL Mailchimp Members] using the Flow Service API

The following tutorial walks you through the steps to create a source connection and a dataflow to bring [!DNL Mailchimp Members] data to Platform using the [[!DNL Flow Service] API](https://www.adobe.io/experience-platform-apis/references/flow-service/).

## Prerequisites

Before you can connect [!DNL Mailchimp] to Adobe Experience Platform using OAuth 2 refresh code, you must first retrieve your access token for [!DNL MailChimp.] See the [[!DNL Mailchimp] OAuth 2 guide](https://mailchimp.com/developer/marketing/guides/access-user-data-oauth-2/) for detailed instructions on finding your access token.

## Create a base connection {#base-connection}

Once you have retrieved your [!DNL Mailchimp] authentication credentials, you can now start the process of creating dataflow to bring [!DNL Mailchimp Members] data to Platform. The first step in creating a dataflow is to create a base connection.

A base connection retains information between your source and Platform, including your source's authentication credentials, the current state of the connection, and your unique base connection ID. The base connection ID allows you to explore and navigate files from within your source and identify the specific items that you want to ingest, including information regarding their data types and formats.

[!DNL Mailchimp] supports both basic authentication and OAuth 2 refresh code. See the following examples for guidance on how to authenticate with either authentication types.

### Create a [!DNL Mailchimp] base connection using basic authentication

To create a [!DNL Mailchimp] base connection using basic authentication, make a POST request to the `/connections` endpoint of [!DNL Flow Service] API while providing credentials for your `host`, `authorizationTestUrl`, `username`, and `password`.

**API format**

```https
POST /connections
```

**Request**

The following request creates a base connection for [!DNL Mailchimp]:

```shell
curl -X POST \
'https://platform.adobe.io/data/foundation/flowservice/connections' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer {ACCESS_TOKEN}' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H 'x-api-key: {API_KEY}' \
  -H 'x-gw-ims-org-id: {ORG_ID}' \
  -H 'x-sandbox-name: {SANDBOX_NAME}'
  -d '{
      "name": "Mailchimp base connection with basic authentication",
      "description": "Mailchimp Members base connection with basic authentication",
      "connectionSpec": {
          "id": "2e8580db-6489-4726-96de-e33f5f60295f",
          "version": "1.0"
      },
      "auth": {
          "specName": "Basic Authentication",
          "params": {
              "host": "{HOST}",
              "authorizationTestUrl": "https://login.mailchimp.com/oauth2/metadata",
              "username": "{USERNAME}",
              "password": "{PASSWORD}"
          }
      }
  }'
```

| Property | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `name` | The name of your base connection. Ensure that the name of your base connection is descriptive as you can use this to look up information on your base connection. |
| `description` | (Optional) A property that you can include to provide more information on your base connection. |
| `connectionSpec.id` | The connection specification ID of your source. This ID can be retrieved after your source is registered and approved through the [!DNL Flow Service] API. |
| `auth.specName` | The authentication type that you are using to connect your source to Platform. |
| `auth.params.host` | The root URL used to connect to [!DNL Mailchimp] API. The format for the root URL is `https://{DC}.api.mailchimp.com`, where `{DC}` represents the data center that corresponds to your account.|
| `auth.params.authorizationTestUrl` | (Optional) The authorization test URL is used to validate credentials when creating a base connection. If unprovided, credentials are automatically checked during the source connection creation step instead. |
| `auth.params.username` | The username that corresponds with your [!DNL Mailchimp] account. This is required for basic authentication. |
| `auth.params.password` | The password that corresponds with your [!DNL Mailchimp] account. This is required for basic authentication. |

**Response**

A successful response returns the newly created base connection, including its unique connection identifier (`id`). This ID is required to explore your source's file structure and contents in the next step.

```json
{
    "id": "4cea039f-f1cc-4fa5-9136-db8dd4c7fbfa",
    "etag": "\"4000cff7-0000-0200-0000-6154bad60000\""
}
```

### Create a [!DNL Mailchimp] base connection using OAuth 2 refresh code

To create a [!DNL Mailchimp] base connection using OAuth 2 refresh code, make a POST request to the `/connections` endpoint while providing credentials for your `host`, `authorizationTestUrl`, and `accessToken`.

**API format**

```https
POST /connections
```

**Request**

The following request creates a base connection for [!DNL Mailchimp]:

```shell
curl -X POST \
  'https://platform.adobe.io/data/foundation/flowservice/connections' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer {ACCESS_TOKEN}' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H 'x-api-key: {API_KEY}' \
  -H 'x-gw-ims-org-id: {ORG_ID}' \
  -H 'x-sandbox-name: {SANDBOX_NAME}'
  -d '{
      "name": "MailChimp base connection with OAuth 2 refresh code",
      "description": "MailChimp Members base connection with OAuth 2 refresh code",
      "connectionSpec": {
          "id": "2e8580db-6489-4726-96de-e33f5f60295f",
          "version": "1.0"
      },
      "auth": {
          "specName": "oAuth2RefreshCode",
          "params": {
              "host": "{HOST}",
              "authorizationTestUrl": "https://login.mailchimp.com/oauth2/metadata",
              "accessToken": "{ACCESS_TOKEN}"
          }
      }
  }'
```

| Property | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `name` | The name of your base connection. Ensure that the name of your base connection is descriptive as you can use this to look up information on your base connection. |
| `description` | (Optional) A property that you can include to provide more information on your base connection. |
| `connectionSpec.id` | The connection specification ID of your source. This ID can be retrieved after registering your source using the [!DNL Flow Service] API. |
| `auth.specName` | The authentication type that you are using to authenticate your source to Platform. |
| `auth.params.host` | The root URL used to connect to [!DNL Mailchimp] API. The format for the root URL is `https://{DC}.api.mailchimp.com`, where `{DC}` represents the data center that corresponds to your account.|
| `auth.params.authorizationTestUrl` | (Optional) The authorization test URL is used to validate credentials when creating a base connection. If unprovided, credentials are automatically checked during the source connection creation step instead. |
| `auth.params.accessToken` | The corresponding access token used to authenticate your source. This is required for OAuth-based authentication. |

**Response**

A successful response returns the newly created base connection, including its unique connection identifier (`id`). This ID is required to explore your source's file structure and contents in the next step.

```json
{
    "id": "4cea039f-f1cc-4fa5-9136-db8dd4c7fbfa",
    "etag": "\"4000cff7-0000-0200-0000-6154bad60000\""
}
```

## Explore your source {#explore}

Using the base connection ID you generated in the previous step, you can explore files and directories by performing GET requests. 

>[!TIP]
>
>To retrieve the accepted format-type for `{SOURCE_PARAMS}`, you must encode the entire `list_id` string in base64. For example, `"list_id": "10c097ca71"` encoded in base64 equates to `eyJsaXN0SWQiOiIxMGMwOTdjYTcxIn0=`.

**API format**

```http
GET /connections/{BASE_CONNECTION_ID}/explore?objectType=rest&object={OBJECT}&fileType={FILE_TYPE}&preview={PREVIEW}&sourceParams={SOURCE_PARAMS}
```

When performing GET requests to explore your source's file structure and contents, you must include the query parameters that are listed in the table below:

| Parameter | Description |
| --------- | ----------- |
| `{BASE_CONNECTION_ID}` | The base connection ID generated in the previous step. |
| `{OBJECT_TYPE}` | The type of the object you wish to explore. For REST sources, this value defaults to `rest`. |
| `{OBJECT}` | The object that you wish to explore. |
| `{FILE_TYPE}` | This parameter is required only when viewing a specific directory. Its value represents the path of the directory you wish to explore. |
| `{PREVIEW}` | A boolean value that defines whether the contents of the connection supports preview. |
| `{SOURCE_PARAMS}` | A base64-encoded string of your `list_id`. |

**Request**

```shell
curl -X GET \
  'https://platform.adobe.io/data/foundation/flowservice/connections/05c595e5-edc3-45c8-90bb-fcf556b57c4b/explore?objectType=rest&object=json&fileType=json&preview=true&sourceParams=eyJsaXN0SWQiOiIxMGMwOTdjYTcxIn0=' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer {ACCESS_TOKEN}' \
  -H 'x-api-key: {API_KEY}' \
  -H 'x-gw-ims-org-id: {ORG_ID}' \
  -H 'x-sandbox-name: {SANDBOX_NAME}'
```

**Response**

A successful response returns the structure of the queried file.

## Create a source connection {#source-connection}

You can create a source connection by making a POST request to the [!DNL Flow Service] API. A source connection consists of a connection ID, a path to the source data file, and a connection spec ID.

To create a source connection, you must also define an enum value for the data format attribute.

Use the following the enum values for file-based sources:

| Data format | Enum value |
| ----------- | ---------- |
| Delimited | `delimited` |
| JSON | `json` |
| Parquet | `parquet` |

For all table-based sources, set the value to `tabular`.

**API format**

```https
POST /sourceConnections
```

**Request**

The following request creates a source connection for [!DNL Mailchimp]:

```shell

## Create a target XDM schema {#target-schema}

In order for the source data to be used in Platform, a target schema must be created to structure the source data according to your needs. The target schema is then used to create a Platform dataset in which the source data is contained.

A target XDM schema can be created by performing a POST request to the [Schema Registry API](https://www.adobe.io/experience-platform-apis/references/schema-registry/).

For detailed steps on how to create a target XDM schema, see the tutorial on [creating a schema using the API](../../../../../xdm/api/schemas.md).

### Create a target dataset {#target-dataset}

A target dataset can be created by performing a POST request to the [Catalog Service API](https://www.adobe.io/apis/experienceplatform/home/api-reference.html#!acpdr/swagger-specs/catalog.yaml), providing the ID of the target schema within the payload.

For detailed steps on how to create a target dataset, see the tutorial on [creating a dataset using the API](../../../../../catalog/api/create-dataset.md).

## Create a target connection {#target-connection}

A target connection represents the connection to the destination where the ingested data lands in. To create a target connection, you must provide the fixed connection specification ID that corresponds to the [!DNL Data Lake]. This ID is: `c604ff05-7f1a-43c0-8e18-33bf874cb11c`.

You now have the unique identifiers a target schema a target dataset and the connection spec ID to the [!DNL Data Lake]. Using these identifiers, you can create a target connection using the [!DNL Flow Service] API to specify the dataset that will contain the inbound source data.

**API format**

```https
POST /targetConnections
```

**Request**

The following request creates a target connection for [!DNL Mailchimp]:

```shell

    "etag": "\"960093ce-0000-0200-0000-6154da3e0000\""
}
```

## Create a mapping {#mapping}

In order for the source data to be ingested into a target dataset, it must first be mapped to the target schema that the target dataset adheres to. This is achieved by performing a POST request to the [[!DNL Data Prep] API](https://www.adobe.io/experience-platform-apis/references/data-prep/) with data mappings defined within the request payload.

**API format**

```http
POST /conversion/mappingSets
```

**Request**

```shell
curl -X POST \
  'https://platform.adobe.io/data/foundation/conversion/mappingSets' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer {ACCESS_TOKEN}' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H 'x-api-key: {API_KEY}' \
  -H 'x-gw-ims-org-id: {ORG_ID}' \
  -H 'x-sandbox-name: {SANDBOX_NAME}'
  -d '{
      "version": 0,
      "xdmSchema": "_{TENANT_ID}.schemas.570630b91eb9d5cf5db0436756abb110d02912917a67da2d",
      "xdmVersion": "1.0",
      "mappings": [
      {
        "destinationXdmPath": "person.name.firstName",

        "version": 0
      },
      {
        "destinationXdmPath": "person.name.lastName",
        "sourceAttribute": "merge_fields.LNAME",
        "identity": false,
        "version": 0
      }
    ]
  }'
```

| Property | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `xdmSchema` | The ID of the [target XDM schema](#target-schema) generated in an earlier step. |
| `mappings.destinationXdmPath` | The destination XDM path where the source attribute is being mapped to. |
| `mappings.sourceAttribute` | The source attribute that needs to be mapped to a destination XDM path. |
| `mappings.identity` | A boolean value that designates whether the mapping set will be marked for [!DNL Identity Service]. |

**Response**

A successful response returns details of the newly created mapping including its unique identifier (`id`). This value is required in a later step to create a dataflow.

```json
{
    "id": "5a365b23962d4653b9d9be25832ee5b4",
    "version": 0,
    "createdDate": 1597784069368,
    "modifiedDate": 1597784069368,
    "createdBy": "{CREATED_BY}",
    "modifiedBy": "{MODIFIED_BY}"
}
```

## Create a flow {#flow}

The last step towards bringing [!DNL Mailchimp] data to Platform is to create a dataflow. By now, you have the following required values prepared:

* [Source connection ID](#source-connection)
* [Target connection ID](#target-connection)
* [Mapping ID](#mapping)

A dataflow is responsible for scheduling and collecting data from a source. You can create a dataflow by performing a POST request while providing the previously mentioned values within the payload.

To schedule an ingestion, you must first set the start time value to epoch time in seconds. Then, you must set the frequency value to one of the five options: `once`, `minute`, `hour`, `day`, or `week`. The interval value designates the period between two consecutive ingestions and creating a one-time ingestion does not require an interval to be set. For all other frequencies, the interval value must be set to equal or greater than `15`.


**API format**

```http
POST /flows
```

**Request**

```shell
curl -X POST \
  'https://platform.adobe.io/data/foundation/flowservice/flows' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer {ACCESS_TOKEN}' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H 'x-api-key: {API_KEY}' \

## Appendix 

The following section provides information on the steps you can to monitor, update, and delete your dataflow.

### Monitor your dataflow

Once your dataflow has been created, you can monitor the data that is being ingested through it to see information on flow runs, completion status, and errors. For complete API examples, read the guide on [monitoring your sources dataflows using the API](../../monitor.md).

### Update your dataflow

Update the details of your dataflow, such as its name and description, as well as its run schedule and associated mapping sets by making a PATCH request to the `/flows` endpoint of [!DNL Flow Service] API, while providing the ID of your dataflow. When making a PATCH request, you must provide your dataflow's unique `etag` in the `If-Match` header. For complete API examples, read the guide on [updating sources dataflows using the API](../../update-dataflows.md).

### Update your account

Update the name, description, and credentials of your source account by performing a PATCH request to the [!DNL Flow Service] API while providing your base connection ID as a query parameter. When making a PATCH request, you must provide your source account's unique `etag` in the `If-Match` header. For complete API examples, read the guide on [updating your source account using the API](../../update.md).

### Delete your dataflow

Delete your dataflow by performing a DELETE request to the [!DNL Flow Service] API while providing the ID of the dataflow you want to delete as part of the query parameter. For complete API examples, read the guide on [deleting your dataflows using the API](../../delete-dataflows).
