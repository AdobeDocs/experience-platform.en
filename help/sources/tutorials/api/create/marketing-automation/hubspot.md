# Create a [!DNL HubSpot] base connection using the [!DNL Flow Service] API

A base connection represents the authenticated connection between a source and Adobe Experience Platform.

This tutorial walks you through the steps to create a base connection for [!DNL HubSpot] using the [[!DNL Flow Service] API](https://www.adobe.io/apis/experienceplatform/home/api-reference.html#!acpdr/swagger-specs/flow-service.yaml).

## Getting started

This guide requires a working understanding of the following components of Adobe Experience Platform:

* [Sources](../../../../home.md): [!DNL Experience Platform] allows data to be ingested from various sources while providing you with the ability to structure, label, and enhance incoming data using [!DNL Platform] services.
* [Sandboxes](../../../../../sandboxes/home.md): [!DNL Experience Platform] provides virtual sandboxes which partition a single [!DNL Platform] instance into separate virtual environments to help develop and evolve digital experience applications.

The following sections provide additional information that you will need to know in order to successfully connect to [!DNL HubSpot] using the [!DNL Flow Service] API.

### Gather required credentials

In order for [!DNL Flow Service] to connect with [!DNL HubSpot], you must provide the following connection properties:

| Credential | Description |
| ---------- | ----------- |
| `clientId` | The client ID associated with your [!DNL HubSpot] application. |
| `clientSecret` | The client secret associated with your [!DNL HubSpot] application. |
| `accessToken` | The access token obtained when initially authenticating your OAuth integration. |
| `refreshToken` | The refresh token obtained when initially authenticating your OAuth integration. |
| `connectionSpec.id` | The connection specification returns a sourceâ€™s connector properties, including authentication specifications related to creating the base and source connections. The connection specification ID for [!DNL HubSpot] is: `cc6a4487-9e91-433e-a3a3-9cf6626c1806`. |

For more information about getting started, refer to this [HubSpot document](https://developers.hubspot.com/docs/methods/oauth2/oauth2-overview).

### Using Platform APIs

For information on how to successfully make calls to Platform APIs, see the guide on [getting started with Platform APIs](../../../../../landing/api-guide.md).

## Create a base connection

A base connection retains information between your source and Platform, including your source's authentication credentials, the current state of the connection, and your unique base connection ID. The base connection ID allows you to explore and navigate files from within your source and identify the specific items that you want to ingest, including information regarding their data types and formats.

To create a base connection ID, make a POST request to the `/connections` endpoint while providing your [!DNL HubSpot] authentication credentials as part of the request parameters.

**API format**

```https
POST /connections
```

**Request**

The following request creates a base connection for [!DNL HubSpot]:

```shell
curl -X POST \
    'https://platform.adobe.io/data/foundation/flowservice/connections' \
    -H 'Authorization: Bearer {ACCESS_TOKEN}' \
    -H 'x-api-key: {API_KEY}' \
    -H 'x-gw-ims-org-id: {IMS_ORG}' \
    -H 'x-sandbox-name: {SANDBOX_NAME}' \
    -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    -d '{
        "name": "connection for HubSpot",
        "description": "connection for HubSpot",
        "auth": {
            "specName": "Basic Authentication",
            "params": {
                "clientId": "{CLIENT_ID}",
                "clientSecret": "{CLIENT_SECRET}",
                "accessToken": "{ACCESS_TOKEN}",
                "refreshToken": "{REFRESH_TOKEN}"
            }
        },
        "connectionSpec": {
            "id": "cc6a4487-9e91-433e-a3a3-9cf6626c1806",
            "version": "1.0"
        }
    }
```

| Property | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| `auth.params.clientId` | The client ID associated with your [!DNL HubSpot] application. |
| `auth.params.clientSecret` | The client secret associated with your [!DNL HubSpot] application. |
| `auth.params.accessToken` | The access token obtained when initially authenticating your OAuth integration. |
| `auth.params.refreshToken` | The refresh token obtained when initially authenticating your OAuth integration. |
| `connectionSpec.id` | The [!DNL HubSpot] connection specification ID: `cc6a4487-9e91-433e-a3a3-9cf6626c1806`. |

**Response**

A successful response returns the newly created connection, including its unique connection identifier (`id`). This ID is required to explore your data in the next tutorial.

```json
{
    "id": "2fce94c1-9a93-4971-8e94-c19a93097129",
    "etag": "\"d403848a-0000-0200-0000-5e978f7b0000\""
}
```

By following this tutorial, you have created a [!DNL HubSpot] connection using the [!DNL Flow Service] API, and have obtained the connection's unique ID value. You can use this connection ID in the next tutorial as you learn how to [explore marketing automation systems using the Flow Service API](../../explore/marketing-automation.md).
