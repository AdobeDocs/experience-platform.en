# Create an [!DNL Oracle Eloqua] base connection using the [!DNL Flow Service] API

>[!WARNING]
>
>The [!DNL Oracle Eloqua] source will be deprecated at the end of June 2025.

A base connection represents the authenticated connection between a source and Adobe Experience Platform.

This tutorial walks you through the steps to create a base connection for [!DNL Oracle Eloqua] using the [[!DNL Flow Service] API](https://www.adobe.io/experience-platform-apis/references/flow-service/).

## Getting Started

This guide requires a working understanding of the following components of Experience Platform:

* [Sources](../../../../home.md): Experience Platform allows data to be ingested from various sources while providing you with the ability to structure, label, and enhance incoming data using [!DNL Experience Platform] services.
* [Sandboxes](../../../../../sandboxes/home.md): Experience Platform provides virtual sandboxes which partition a single [!DNL Experience Platform] instance into separate virtual environments to help develop and evolve digital experience applications.

The following sections provide additional information that you need to know in order to successfully connect to [!DNL Oracle Eloqua] using the [!DNL Flow Service] API.

### Gather required credentials

In order for [!DNL Flow Service] to connect with [!DNL Oracle Eloqua], you must provide values for the following connection properties:

| Credential | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `endpoint` | The endpoint of your [!DNL Oracle Eloqua]. |
| `username` | The username of your [!DNL Oracle Eloqua] account. The username must be formatted as `siteName + \\ + username`, where `siteName` is the company name you used to log in to [!DNL Oracle Eloqua] and `username` is your username. For example, your log in username can be: `adobe\\emily`. |
| `password` | The password corresponding to your [!DNL Oracle Eloqua] username. |
| `connectionSpec.id` | The connection specification returns a source's connector properties, including authentication specifications related to creating the base and source connections. The value for the connection specification ID of the [!DNL Oracle Eloqua] source is fixed as: `35d6c4d8-c9a9-11eb-b8bc-0242ac130003`. |

For more information on authentication credentials for [!DNL Oracle Eloqua], see the [[!DNL Oracle Eloqua] guide on authentication](https://docs.oracle.com/en/cloud/saas/marketing/eloqua-rest-api/Authentication_Basic.html).

### Using Experience Platform APIs

For information on how to successfully make calls to Experience Platform APIs, see the guide on [getting started with Experience Platform APIs](../../../../../landing/api-guide.md).

## Create a base connection

A base connection retains information between your source and Experience Platform, including your source's authentication credentials, the current state of the connection, and your unique base connection ID. The base connection ID allows you to explore and navigate files from within your source and identify the specific items that you want to ingest, including information regarding their data types and formats.

To create a base connection ID, make a POST request to the `/connections` endpoint while providing your [!DNL Oracle Eloqua] authentication credentials as part of the request parameters.

**API format**

```https
POST /connections
```

**Request**

The following request creates a base connection for [!DNL Oracle Eloqua]:

```shell
curl -X POST \
  'https://platform.adobe.io/data/foundation/flowservice/connections' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer {ACCESS_TOKEN}' \
  -H 'x-api-key: {API_KEY}' \
  -H 'x-gw-ims-org-id: {ORG_ID}' \
  -H 'x-sandbox-name: {SANDBOX_NAME}' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json'
  -d '{
      "name": "Oracle Eloqua Base Connection",
      "description": "Base Connection for Oracle Eloqua",
      "auth": {
          "specName": "Basic Authentication",
          "params": {
              "endpoint": "{ENDPOINT}",
              "username": "{USERNAME}",
              "password": "{PASSWORD}"
          }
      },
      "connectionSpec": {
          "id": "35d6c4d8-c9a9-11eb-b8bc-0242ac130003",
          "version": "1.0"
      }
  }'
```

| Parameter | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `name` | The name of your [!DNL Oracle Eloqua] base connection. It is recommended to provide a descriptive name as you can use this value to look up your base connection. |
| `description` | (Optional) A property that you can include to provide supplementary information on your base connection. |
| `auth.specName` | The authentication type used for the connection. |
| `auth.params.endpoint` | The endpoint of your [!DNL Oracle Eloqua] server.  |
| `auth.params.username` | The concatenated credential that includes the site name and username that corresponds with your [!DNL Oracle Eloqua] account. |
| `auth.params.password` | The password that corresponds with your [!DNL Oracle Eloqua] account. |
| `connectionSpec.id` | The value for the connection specification ID of the [!DNL Oracle Eloqua] source is fixed as: `35d6c4d8-c9a9-11eb-b8bc-0242ac130003`. |

**Response**

A successful response returns details of the newly created base connection, including its unique identifier (`id`). This ID is required in the next step to create a source connection.

```json
{
    "id": "2484f2df-c057-4ab5-84f2-dfc0577ab592",
    "etag": "\"10033e77-0000-0200-0000-5e96785b0000\""
}
```
