# Create a [!DNL Salesforce] base connection using the [!DNL Flow Service] API

A base connection represents the authenticated connection between a source and Adobe Experience Platform.

This tutorial walks you through the steps to create a base connection for [!DNL Salesforce] using the [[!DNL Flow Service] API](https://www.adobe.io/apis/experienceplatform/home/api-reference.html#!acpdr/swagger-specs/flow-service.yaml).

## Getting started

This guide requires a working understanding of the following components of Adobe Experience Platform:

* [Sources](../../../../home.md): [!DNL Experience Platform] allows data to be ingested from various sources while providing you with the ability to structure, label, and enhance incoming data using [!DNL Platform] services.
* [Sandboxes](../../../../../sandboxes/home.md): [!DNL Experience Platform] provides virtual sandboxes which partition a single [!DNL Platform] instance into separate virtual environments to help develop and evolve digital experience applications.

The following sections provide additional information that you will need to know in order to successfully connect [!DNL Platform] to a [!DNL Salesforce] account using the [!DNL Flow Service] API.

### Gather required credentials

In order for [!DNL Flow Service] to connect to [!DNL Salesforce], you must provide values for the following connection properties:

| Credential | Description |
| ---------- | ----------- |
| `environmentUrl` | The URL of the [!DNL Salesforce] source instance. |
| `username` | The username for the [!DNL Salesforce] user account. |
| `password` | The password for the [!DNL Salesforce] user account. |
| `securityToken` | The security token for the [!DNL Salesforce] user account. |
| `connectionSpec.id` | The connection specification returns a sourceâ€™s connector properties, including authentication specifications related to creating the base and source connections. The connection specification ID for [!DNL AdWords] is: `cfc0fee1-7dc0-40ef-b73e-d8b134c436f5`. |

For more information on getting started, visit [this Salesforce document](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.api_rest.meta/api_rest/intro_understanding_authentication.htm).

### Using Platform APIs

For information on how to successfully make calls to Platform APIs, see the guide on [getting started with Platform APIs](../../../../../landing/api-guide.md).

## Create a base connection

A base connection retains information between your source and Platform, including your source's authentication credentials, the current state of the connection, and your unique base connection ID. The base connection ID allows you to explore and navigate files from within your source and identify the specific items that you want to ingest, including information regarding their data types and formats.

To create a base connection ID, make a POST request to the `/connections` endpoint while providing your [!DNL Salesforce] authentication credentials as part of the request parameters.


**API format**

```http
POST /connections
```

**Request**

The following request creates a base connection for [!DNL Salesforce]:

```shell
curl -X POST \
    'https://platform.adobe.io/data/foundation/flowservice/connections' \
    -H 'Authorization: Bearer {ACCESS_TOKEN}' \
    -H 'x-api-key: {API_KEY}' \
    -H 'x-gw-ims-org-id: {IMS_ORG}' \
    -H 'x-sandbox-name: {SANDBOX_NAME}' \
    -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    -d '{
        "name": "Salesforce Connection",
        "description": "Connection for Salesforce account",
        "auth": {
            "specName": "Basic Authentication",
            "params": {
                "username": "{USERNAME}",
                "password": "{PASSWORD}",
                "securityToken": "{SECURITY_TOKEN}"
            }
        },
        "connectionSpec": {
            "id": "cfc0fee1-7dc0-40ef-b73e-d8b134c436f5",
            "version": "1.0"
        }
    }'
```

| Property | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| `auth.params.username` | The username associated with your [!DNL Salesforce] account. |
| `auth.params.password` | The password associated with your [!DNL Salesforce] account. |
| `auth.params.securityToken` | The security token associated with your [!DNL Salesforce] account. |
| `connectionSpec.id` |  The [!DNL Salesforce] connection specification ID: `cfc0fee1-7dc0-40ef-b73e-d8b134c436f5`. |

**Response**

A successful response returns the newly created connection, including its unique identifier (`id`). This ID is required to explore your CRM system in the next step.

```json
{
    "id": "4cb0c374-d3bb-4557-b139-5712880adc55",
    "etag": "\"1700df7b-0000-0200-0000-5e3b424f0000\""
}
```

## Next steps

By following this tutorial, you have created a [!DNL Salesforce] connection using the [!DNL Flow Service] API and have obtained the connection's unique ID value. You can use this ID in the next tutorial as you learn how to  [explore CRM systems using the Flow Service API](../../explore/crm.md).
