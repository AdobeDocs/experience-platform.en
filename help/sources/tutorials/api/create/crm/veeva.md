# (Beta) Create a [!DNL Veeva CRM] base connection using the [!DNL Flow Service] API

>[!NOTE]
>
>The [!DNL Veeva CRM] source is in beta. See the [Sources overview](../../../../home.md#terms-and-conditions) for more information on using beta-labelled connectors.

A base connection represents the authenticated connection between a source and Adobe Experience Platform.

This tutorial walks you through the steps to create a base connection for [!DNL Veeva CRM] using the [[!DNL Flow Service] API](https://www.adobe.io/experience-platform-apis/references/flow-service/).

## Getting Started

This guide requires a working understanding of the following components of Adobe Experience Platform:

* [Sources](../../../../home.md): [!DNL Experience Platform] allows data to be ingested from various sources while providing you with the ability to structure, label, and enhance incoming data using [!DNL Platform] services.
* [Sandboxes](../../../../../sandboxes/home.md): [!DNL Experience Platform] provides virtual sandboxes which partition a single [!DNL Platform] instance into separate virtual environments to help develop and evolve digital experience applications.

The following sections provide additional information that you need to know in order to successfully connect to [!DNL Veeva CRM] using the [!DNL Flow Service] API.

### Gather required credentials

In order for [!DNL Flow Service] to connect with [!DNL Veeva CRM], you must provide values for the following connection properties:

| Credential | Description |
| ---------- | ----------- |
| `environmentUrl` | The URL of your [!DNL Veeva CRM] instance. |
| `username` | The username value of your [!DNL Veeva CRM] account. |
| `password` | The password value of your [!DNL Veeva CRM] account. |
| `securityToken` | The security token for your [!DNL Veeva CRM] instance. |
| `connectionSpec.id` | The connection specification returns a sourceâ€™s connector properties, including authentication specifications related to creating the base and source connections. The connection specification ID for [!DNL Veeva CRM] is: `fcad62f3-09b0-41d3-be11-449d5a621b69`. |

For more information about these values, refer to this [[!DNL Veeva CRM] document](https://developer.veevacrm.com/api/#order-management-rest-api).

### Using Platform APIs

For information on how to successfully make calls to Platform APIs, see the guide on [getting started with Platform APIs](../../../../../landing/api-guide.md).

## Create a base connection

A base connection retains information between your source and Platform, including your source's authentication credentials, the current state of the connection, and your unique base connection ID. The base connection ID allows you to explore and navigate files from within your source and identify the specific items that you want to ingest, including information regarding their data types and formats.

To create a base connection ID, make a POST request to the `/connections` endpoint while providing your [!DNL Veeva CRM] authentication credentials as part of the request parameters.

**API format**

```https
POST /connections
```

**Request**

The following request creates a base connection for [!DNL Veeva CRM]:

```shell
curl -X POST \
    'https://platform.adobe.io/data/foundation/flowservice/connections' \
    -H 'Authorization: Bearer {ACCESS_TOKEN}' \
    -H 'x-api-key: {API_KEY}' \
    -H 'x-gw-ims-org-id: {IMS_ORG}' \
    -H 'x-sandbox-name: {SANDBOX_NAME}' \
    -H 'Content-Type: application/json'
    -d '{
        "name": "Veeva CRM base connection",
        "description": "Base Connection for Veeva CRM",
        "auth": {
            "specName": "Basic Authentication",
            "params": {
                "environmentUrl": "{ENVIRONMENT_URL}",
                "username": "{USERNAME}",
                "password": "{PASSWORD}",
                "securityToken": "{SECURITY_TOKEN}"
            }
        },
        "connectionSpec": {
            "id": "fcad62f3-09b0-41d3-be11-449d5a621b69",
            "version": "1.0"
        }
    }'
```

| Parameter | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `name` | The name of your [!DNL Veeva CRM] base connection. You can use this name to lookup your [!DNL Veeva CRM] base connection. |
| `description` | An optional description for your [!DNL Veeva CRM] base connection. |
| `auth.specName` | The authentication type used for the connection. |
| `auth.params.environmentUrl` | The URL of your [!DNL Veeva CRM] instance. |
| `auth.params.username` | The username value of your [!DNL Veeva CRM] account. |
| `auth.params.password` | The password value of your [!DNL Veeva CRM] account. |
| `auth.params.securityToken` | The security token for your [!DNL Veeva CRM] instance. |
| `connectionSpec.id` | The connection specification ID for [!DNL Veeva CRM]: `fcad62f3-09b0-41d3-be11-449d5a621b69`. |

**Response**

A successful response returns details of the newly created base connection, including its unique identifier (`id`). This ID is required in the next step to create a source connection.

```json
{
    "id": "2484f2df-c057-4ab5-84f2-dfc0577ab592",
    "etag": "\"10033e77-0000-0200-0000-5e96785b0000\""
}
```

## Next steps

By following this tutorial, you have created an [!DNL Veeva CRM] base connection using the [!DNL Flow Service] API and have obtained the connection's unique ID value. You can use this ID in the next tutorial as you learn how to [explore CRM systems using the Flow Service API](../../explore/crm.md).
