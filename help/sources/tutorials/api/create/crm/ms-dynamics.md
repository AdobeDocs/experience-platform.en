# Create a [!DNL Microsoft Dynamics] base connection using the [!DNL Flow Service] API

A base connection represents the authenticated connection between a source and Adobe Experience Platform.

This tutorial walks you through the steps to create a base connection for [!DNL Microsoft Dynamics] (hereinafter referred to as "[!DNL Dynamics]") using the [[!DNL Flow Service] API](https://www.adobe.io/experience-platform-apis/references/flow-service/).

## Getting started

This guide requires a working understanding of the following components of Adobe Experience Platform:

* [Sources](../../../../home.md): Experience Platform allows data to be ingested from various sources while providing you with the ability to structure, label, and enhance incoming data using Platform services.
* [Sandboxes](../../../../../sandboxes/home.md): Experience Platform provides virtual sandboxes which partition a single Platform instance into separate virtual environments to help develop and evolve digital experience applications.

The following sections provide additional information that you will need to know in order to successfully connect Platform to a Dynamics account using the [!DNL Flow Service] API.

### Gather required credentials

In order for [!DNL Flow Service] to connect to [!DNL Dynamics], you must provide values for the following connection properties:

>[!BEGINTABS]

>[!TAB Basic authentication]

| Credential | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `serviceUri` | The service URL of your [!DNL Dynamics] instance. |
| `username` | The user name for your [!DNL Dynamics] user account. |
| `password` | The password for your [!DNL Dynamics] account. |

>[!TAB Service-principal and key authentication]

| Credential | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `servicePrincipalId` | The client ID of your [!DNL Dynamics] account. This ID is required when using service principal and key-based authentication. |
| `servicePrincipalKey` | The service principal secret key. This credential is required when using service principal and key-based authentication. |

>[!ENDTABS]

For more information on getting started, refer to [this [!DNL Dynamics] document](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powerapps/developer/common-data-service/authenticate-oauth).

### Using Platform APIs

For information on how to successfully make calls to Platform APIs, see the guide on [getting started with Platform APIs](../../../../../landing/api-guide.md).

## Create a base connection

>[!TIP]
>
>Once created, you cannot change the authentication type of a [!DNL Dynamics] base connection. To change the authentication type, you must create a new base connection.

A base connection retains information between your source and Platform, including your source's authentication credentials, the current state of the connection, and your unique base connection ID. The base connection ID allows you to explore and navigate files from within your source and identify the specific items that you want to ingest, including information regarding their data types and formats.

To create a base connection ID, make a POST request to the `/connections` endpoint while providing your [!DNL Dynamics] authentication credentials as part of the request parameters.

### Create a [!DNL Dynamics] base connection 

>[!TIP]
>
>Once created, you cannot change the authentication type of an [!DNL Dynamics] base connection. To change the authentication type, you must create a new base connection.

The first step in creating a source connection is to authenticate your [!DNL Dynamics] source and generate a base connection ID. A base connection ID allows you to explore and navigate files from within your source and identify specific items that you want to ingest, including information regarding their data types and formats.

To create a base connection ID, make a POST request to the `/connections` endpoint while providing your [!DNL Dynamics] authentication credentials as part of the request parameters.

**API format**

```http
POST /connections
```

>[!BEGINTABS]

>[!TAB Basic authentication]

To create a [!DNL Dynamics] base connection using basic authentication, make a POST request to the [!DNL Flow Service] API while providing values for your connection's `serviceUri`, `username`, and `password`.

+++Request

```shell
curl -X POST \
    'https://platform.adobe.io/data/foundation/flowservice/connections' \
