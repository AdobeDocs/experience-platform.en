# Create a [!DNL Google Cloud Storage] base connection using the [!DNL Flow Service] API

A base connection represents the authenticated connection between a source and Adobe Experience Platform.

This tutorial walks you through the steps to create a base connection for [!DNL Google Cloud Storage] using the [[!DNL Flow Service] API](https://www.adobe.io/apis/experienceplatform/home/api-reference.html#!acpdr/swagger-specs/flow-service.yaml).

## Getting started

This guide requires a working understanding of the following components of Adobe Experience Platform:

* [Sources](../../../../home.md): [!DNL Experience Platform] allows data to be ingested from various sources while providing you with the ability to structure, label, and enhance incoming data using [!DNL Platform] services.
* [Sandboxes](../../../../../sandboxes/home.md): [!DNL Experience Platform] provides virtual sandboxes which partition a single [!DNL Platform] instance into separate virtual environments to help develop and evolve digital experience applications.

The following sections provide additional information that you will need to know in order to successfully connect to a Google Cloud Storage account using the [!DNL Flow Service] API.

### Gather required credentials

In order for [!DNL Flow Service] to connect with your [!DNL Google Cloud Storage] account, you must provide values for the following connection properties:

| Credential | Description |
| ---------- | ----------- |
| `accessKeyId` | A 61-character, alphanumeric string used to authenticate your [!DNL Google Cloud Storage] account to Platform. |
| `secretAccessKey` | A 40-character, base-64-encoded string used to authenticate your [!DNL Google Cloud Storage] account to Platform. |

For more information about these values, see the [Google Cloud Storage HMAC keys](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/authentication/hmackeys#overview) guide. For steps on how to generate your own access key ID and secret access key, refer to the [[!DNL Google Cloud Storage] overview](../../../../connectors/cloud-storage/google-cloud-storage.md).

### Using Platform APIs

For information on how to successfully make calls to Platform APIs, see the guide on [getting started with Platform APIs](../../../../../landing/api-guide.md).

## Create a base connection

A base connection retains information between your source and Platform, including your source's authentication credentials, the current state of the connection, and your unique base connection ID. The base connection ID allows you to explore and navigate files from within your source and identify the specific items that you want to ingest, including information regarding their data types and formats.

To create a base connection ID, make a POST request to the `/connections` endpoint while providing your [!DNL Google Cloud Storage] authentication credentials as part of the request parameters.

**API format**

```http
POST /connections
```

**Request**

The following request creates a base connection for [!DNL Google Cloud Storage]:

```shell
curl -X POST \
    'https://platform.adobe.io/data/foundation/flowservice/connections' \
    -H 'Authorization: Bearer {ACCESS_TOKEN}' \
    -H 'x-api-key: {API_KEY}' \
    -H 'x-gw-ims-org-id: {IMS_ORG}' \
    -H 'x-sandbox-name: {SANDBOX_NAME}' \
    -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    -d '{
        "name": "Google Cloud Storage connection",
        "description": "Connector for Google Cloud Storage",
        "auth": {
            "specName": "Basic Authentication for google-cloud",
            "params": {
                "accessKeyId": "accessKeyId",
                "secretAccessKey": "secretAccessKey"
            }
        },
        "connectionSpec": {
            "id": "32e8f412-cdf7-464c-9885-78184cb113fd",
            "version": "1.0"
        }
    }'
```

| Property | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| `auth.params.accessKeyId` | The access key ID associated with your [!DNL Google Cloud Storage] account. |
| `auth.params.secretAccessKey` | The secret access key associated with your [!DNL Google Cloud Storage] account. |
| `connectionSpec.id` | The [!DNL Google Cloud Storage] connection specification ID: `32e8f412-cdf7-464c-9885-78184cb113fd` |

**Response**

A successful response returns details of the newly created connection, including its unique identifier (`id`). This ID is required to explore your cloud storage data in the next tutorial.

```json
{
    "id": "4cb0c374-d3bb-4557-b139-5712880adc55",
    "etag": "\"6507cfd8-0000-0200-0000-5e18fc600000\""
}
```

## Next steps

By following this tutorial, you have created a [!DNL Google Cloud Storage] connection using APIs and a unique ID was obtained as part of the response body. You can use this connection ID to [explore cloud storages using the Flow Service API](../../explore/cloud-storage.md) or [ingest Parquet data using the Flow Service API](../../cloud-storage-parquet.md).
