# Create an Amazon S3 connector using the Flow Service API

Flow Service is used to collect and centralize customer data from various disparate sources within Adobe Experience Platform. The service provides a user interface and RESTful API from which all supported sources are connectable.

This tutorial uses the Flow Service API to walk you through the steps to connect Experience Platform to an Amazon S3 (hereinafter referred to as "S3") storage.

If you would prefer to use the user interface in Experience Platform, the [Azure Blob or Amazon S3 source connector UI tutorial](../../../ui/create/cloud-storage/blob-s3.md) provides step-by-step instructions for performing similar actions.

## Getting started

This guide requires a working understanding of the following components of Adobe Experience Platform:

*   [Sources](../../../../home.md): Experience Platform allows data to be ingested from various sources while providing you with the ability to structure, label, and enhance incoming data using Platform services.
*   [Sandboxes](../../../../../sandboxes/home.md): Experience Platform provides virtual sandboxes which partition a single Platform instance into separate virtual environments to help develop and evolve digital experience applications.

The following sections provide additional information that you will need to know in order to successfully connect to an S3 storage using the Flow Service API.

### Gather required credentials

In order for Flow Service to connect with your S3 storage, you must provide values for the following connection properties:

| Credential | Description |
| ---------- | ----------- |
| `s3AccessKey` | The access key ID for your S3 storage. |
| `s3SecretKey` | The secret key ID for your S3 storage. |

For more information on getting started, visit [this AWS document](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/wheres-my-secret-access-key/).

### Reading sample API calls

This tutorial provides example API calls to demonstrate how to format your requests. These include paths, required headers, and properly formatted request payloads. Sample JSON returned in API responses is also provided. For information on the conventions used in documentation for sample API calls, see the section on [how to read example API calls](../../../../../landing/troubleshooting.md#how-do-i-format-an-api-request) in the Experience Platform troubleshooting guide.

### Gather values for required headers

In order to make calls to Platform APIs, you must first complete the [authentication tutorial](../../../../../tutorials/authentication.md). Completing the authentication tutorial provides the values for each of the required headers in all Experience Platform API calls, as shown below:

*   Authorization: Bearer `{ACCESS_TOKEN}`
*   x-api-key: `{API_KEY}`
*   x-gw-ims-org-id: `{IMS_ORG}`

All resources in Experience Platform, including those belonging to the Flow Service, are isolated to specific virtual sandboxes. All requests to Platform APIs require a header that specifies the name of the sandbox the operation will take place in:

*   x-sandbox-name: `{SANDBOX_NAME}`

All requests that contain a payload (POST, PUT, PATCH) require an additional media type header:

*   Content-Type: `application/json`

## Look up connection specifications

Before connecting Platform to an S3 storage, you must verify that connection specifications exist for S3. If connection specifications do not exist then a connection cannot be made.

Each available source has its own unique set of connection specifications for describing connector properties such as authentication requirements. You can look up connection specifications for S3 by performing a GET request and using query parameters.

**API format**

Sending a GET request without query parameters will return connection specifications for all available sources. You can include the query `property=name=="amazon-s3"` to obtain information specifically for S3.

```http
GET /connectionSpecs
GET /connectionSpecs?property=name=="amazon-s3"
```

**Request**

The following request retrieves the connection specifications for S3.

```shell
curl -X GET \
    'https://platform.adobe.io/data/foundation/flowservice/connectionSpecs?property=name=="amazon-s3"' \
    -H 'Authorization: Bearer {ACCESS_TOKEN}' \
    -H 'x-api-key: {API_KEY}' \
    -H 'x-gw-ims-org-id: {IMS_ORG}' \
    -H 'x-sandbox-name: {SANDBOX_NAME}'
```

**Response**

A successful response returns the connection specifications for S3, including its unique identifier (`id`). This ID is required in the next step to create a base connection.

```json
{
    "items": [
        {
            "id": "ecadc60c-7455-4d87-84dc-2a0e293d997b",
            "name": "amazon-s3",
            "providerId": "0ed90a81-07f4-4586-8190-b40eccef1c5a",
            "version": "1.0",
            "authSpec": [
                {
                    "name": "Access Key",
                    "type": "Access Key Auth",
                    "spec": {
                        "$schema": "http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema#",
                        "type": "object",
                        "description": "defines auth params required for connecting to amazon-s3",
                        "properties": {
                            "s3AccessKey": {
                                "type": "string",
                                "description": "access key id"
                            },
                            "s3SecretKey": {
                                "type": "string",
                                "description": "Secret access key for the user account",
                                "format": "password"
                            }
                        },
                        "required": [
                            "accessKeyId",
                            "secretAccessKey"
                        ]
                    }
                }
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```

## Create a base connection

A base connection specifies a source and contains your credentials for that source. Only one base connection is required per S3 account as it can be used to create multiple source connectors to bring in different data.

**API format**

```http
POST /connections
```

**Request**

```shell
curl -X POST \
    'http://platform.adobe.io/data/foundation/flowservice/connections' \
    -H 'Authorization: Bearer {ACCESS_TOKEN}' \
    -H 'x-api-key: {API_KEY}' \
    -H 'x-gw-ims-org-id: {IMS_ORG}' \
    -H 'x-sandbox-name: {SANDBOX_NAME}' \
    -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    -d '{
        "name": "S3 Base Connection",
        "description": "Base connection for an Amazon S3 account",
        "auth": {
            "specName": "Access Key",
            "params": {
                "s3AccessKey": "{S3_ACCESS_KEY}",
                "s3SecretKey": "{S3_SECRET_KEY}"
            }
        },
        "connectionSpec": {
            "id": "ecadc60c-7455-4d87-84dc-2a0e293d997b",
            "version": "1.0"
        }
    }'
```

| Property | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| `auth.params.s3AccessKey` | The access key associated with your S3 storage. |
| `auth.params.s3SecretKey` | Your secret key associated with your S3 storage. |
| `connectionSpec.id` | The connection specification `id` of your S3 storage retrieved in the previous step. |

**Response**

A successful response returns details of the newly created base connection, including its unique identifier (`id`). This ID is required to explore your storage in the next tutorial.

```json
{
    "id": "4cb0c374-d3bb-4557-b139-5712880adc55",
    "etag": "\"1700d77b-0000-0200-0000-5e3b41a10000\""
}
```

## Next steps

By following this tutorial, you have created an S3 connection using APIs and a unique ID was obtained as part of the response body. You can use this connection ID to [explore cloud storages using the Flow Service API](../../explore/cloud-storage.md) or [ingest parquet data using the Flow Service API](../../cloud-storage-parquet.md).
