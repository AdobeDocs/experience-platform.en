# Create an [!DNL Amazon] S3 base connection using the [!DNL Flow Service] API

A base connection represents the authenticated connection between a source and Adobe Experience Platform.

This tutorial walks you through the steps to create a base connection for [!DNL Amazon S3] (hereinafter referred to as "[!DNL S3]") using the [[!DNL Flow Service] API](https://www.adobe.io/experience-platform-apis/references/flow-service/).

## Getting started

This guide requires a working understanding of the following components of Adobe Experience Platform:

* [Sources](../../../../home.md): [!DNL Experience Platform] allows data to be ingested from various sources while providing you with the ability to structure, label, and enhance incoming data using [!DNL Platform] services.
* [Sandboxes](../../../../../sandboxes/home.md): [!DNL Experience Platform] provides virtual sandboxes which partition a single [!DNL Platform] instance into separate virtual environments to help develop and evolve digital experience applications.

The following sections provide additional information that you will need to know in order to successfully connect to an [!DNL S3] storage using the [!DNL Flow Service] API.

### Gather required credentials

In order for [!DNL Flow Service] to connect with your [!DNL S3] storage, you must provide values for the following connection properties:

| Credential | Description |
| ---------- | ----------- |
| `s3AccessKey` | The access key ID for your [!DNL S3] bucket. |
| `s3SecretKey` | The secret key ID for your [!DNL S3] bucket. |
| `serviceUrl` | (Optional) The custom [!DNL S3] endpoint to connect to. This field is required when your [!DNL S3] bucket is region-specific. The format for `serviceUrl` is: `https://s3.{REGION}.amazonaws.com/)`. |
| `bucketName` | The [!DNL S3] bucket contains your data and its corresponding descriptive metadata. Your [!DNL S3] bucket name must be between three and 63 characters long and must begin and end with either a letter or a number. The bucket name can only have lowercase letters, numbers, or hyphens (`-`), and cannot be formatted as an IP address. |
| `folderPath` | The path to the folder in your [!DNL S3] bucket where your data is stored. This credential is required when the user has restricted access. |
| `s3SessionToken` | (Optional) A short-term, temporary token that allows you to provide temporary access to your [!DNL S3] resources to users in untrusted environments. See the [[!DNL S3] overview](../../../../connectors/cloud-storage/s3.md#prerequisites) for more information. |
| `connectionSpec.id` | The connection specification returns a source's connector properties, including authentication specifications related to creating the base and source connections. The connection specification ID for [!DNL S3] is: `ecadc60c-7455-4d87-84dc-2a0e293d997b`. |

For more information on getting started, visit [this [!DNL Amazon Web Services] document](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/wheres-my-secret-access-key/).

### Using Platform APIs

For information on how to successfully make calls to Platform APIs, see the guide on [getting started with Platform APIs](../../../../../landing/api-guide.md).

## Create a base connection

A base connection retains information between your source and Platform, including your source's authentication credentials, the current state of the connection, and your unique base connection ID. The base connection ID allows you to explore and navigate files from within your source and identify the specific items that you want to ingest, including information regarding their data types and formats.

To create a base connection ID, make a POST request to the `/connections` endpoint while providing your [!DNL S3] authentication credentials as part of the request parameters.

**API format**

```http
POST /connections
```

**Request**

The following request creates a base connection for [!DNL S3]:

```shell
curl -X POST \
    'https://platform.adobe.io/data/foundation/flowservice/connections' \
    -H 'Authorization: Bearer {ACCESS_TOKEN}' \
    -H 'x-api-key: {API_KEY}' \
    -H 'x-gw-ims-org-id: {ORG_ID}' \
    -H 'x-sandbox-name: {SANDBOX_NAME}' \
    -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    -d '{
        "name": "Amazon S3 base connection",
        "description": "Amazon S3 base connection with temporary session token",
        "auth": {
            "specName": "Access Key",
            "params": {
                "s3AccessKey": "{S3_ACCESS_KEY}",
                "s3SecretKey": "{S3_SECRET_KEY}",
                "s3SessionToken": "{S3_SESSION_TOKEN}
            }
        },
        "connectionSpec": {
            "id": "ecadc60c-7455-4d87-84dc-2a0e293d997b",
            "version": "1.0"
        }
    }'
```

| Property | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| `auth.params.s3AccessKey` | The access key associated with your [!DNL S3] bucket. |
| `auth.params.s3SecretKey` | Your secret key associated with your [!DNL S3] bucket. |
| `auth.params.s3SessionToken` | (Optional) The short-term, temporary [!DNL S3] token used to access your bucket. |
| `connectionSpec.id` | The [!DNL S3] connection specification ID: `ecadc60c-7455-4d87-84dc-2a0e293d997b` |

**Response**

A successful response returns details of the newly created connection, including its unique identifier (`id`). This ID is required to explore your storage in the next tutorial.

```json
{
    "id": "4cb0c374-d3bb-4557-b139-5712880adc55",
    "etag": "\"1700d77b-0000-0200-0000-5e3b41a10000\""
}
```

## Next steps

By following this tutorial, you have created an S3 connection using APIs and a unique ID was obtained as part of the response body. You can use this connection ID to [explore cloud storages using the Flow Service API](../../explore/cloud-storage.md).

## Appendix

The following section provides additional information on using the [!DNL S3] source.

### Update your [!DNL S3] session token

The `s3SessionToken` is temporary and must be updated when it expires. You can update the session token associated with your base connection by making a PATCH request to [!DNL Flow Service] API. See the [[!DNL S3] overview](../../../../connectors/cloud-storage/s3.md#prerequisites) for more information on temporary security credentials for [!DNL S3].

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>The `If-Match` header is required when making a PATCH request. The value for this header is the unique etag of the connection you want to update.

**API format**

```http
PATCH /connections
```

**Request**

The following request creates a base connection for [!DNL S3]:

```shell
curl -X PATCH \
    'https://platform.adobe.io/data/foundation/flowservice/connections/4cb0c374-d3bb-4557-b139-5712880adc55' \
    -H 'Authorization: Bearer {ACCESS_TOKEN}' \
    -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    -H 'x-api-key: {API_KEY}' \
    -H 'x-gw-ims-org-id: {ORG_ID}' \
    -H 'x-sandbox-name: {SANDBOX_NAME}' \
    -H 'If-Match: "1700d77b-0000-0200-0000-5e3b41a10000"'
    -d '[
        {
            "op": "replace",
            "path": "/auth/params/s3SessionToken",
            "value": "{SESSION_TOKEN}"
        }
    ]'
```

| Parameter | Description |
| --------- | ----------- |
| `op` | The operation call used to define the action needed to update the connection. Operations include: `add`, `replace`, and `remove`. |
| `path` | The path of the parameter to be updated. |
| `value` | The new value you want to update your parameter with. |

**Response**

A successful response returns your base connection ID and an updated etag. You can verify the update by making a GET request to the [!DNL Flow Service] API, while providing your connection ID.

```json
{
    "id": "4cb0c374-d3bb-4557-b139-5712880adc55",
    "etag": "\"3600e378-0000-0200-0000-5f40212f0000\""
}
