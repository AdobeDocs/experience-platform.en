# Connect [!DNL Data Landing Zone] to Adobe Experience Platform using the Flow Service API

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>This page is specific to the [!DNL Data Landing Zone] *source* connector in Experience Platform. For information on connecting to the [!DNL Data Landing Zone] *destination* connector, refer to the [[!DNL Data Landing Zone] destination documentation page](/help/destinations/catalog/cloud-storage/data-landing-zone.md).

[!DNL Data Landing Zone] is a secure, cloud-based file storage facility to bring files into Adobe Experience Platform. Data is automatically deleted from the [!DNL Data Landing Zone] after seven days.

This tutorial walks you through the steps on how to create a [!DNL Data Landing Zone] source connection using the [[!DNL Flow Service] API](https://www.adobe.io/experience-platform-apis/references/flow-service/). This tutorial also provides instructions on how to retrieve your [!DNL Data Landing Zone], as well as view and refresh your credentials.

## Getting started

This guide requires a working understanding of the following components of Experience Platform:

* [Sources](../../../../home.md): Experience Platform allows data to be ingested from various sources while providing you with the ability to structure, label, and enhance incoming data using Platform services.
* [Sandboxes](../../../../../sandboxes/home.md): Experience Platform provides virtual sandboxes which partition a single Platform instance into separate virtual environments to help develop and evolve digital experience applications.

The following sections provide additional information that you will need to know in order to successfully create a [!DNL Data Landing Zone] source connection using the [!DNL Flow Service] API.

This tutorial also requires you to read the guide on [getting started with Platform APIs](../../../../../landing/api-guide.md) to learn how to authenticate to Platform APIs and interpret the example calls provided in the documentation.

## Retrieve a usable landing zone

The first step in using APIs to access [!DNL Data Landing Zone] is to make a GET request to the `/landingzone` endpoint of the [!DNL Connectors] API while providing `type=user_drop_zone` as part of your request header.

**API format**

```http
GET /data/foundation/connectors/landingzone?type=user_drop_zone
```

| Headers | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `user_drop_zone` |  The `user_drop_zone` type allows the API to distinguish a landing zone container from the other types of containers that are available to you. |

**Request**

The following request retrieves an existing landing zone.

```shell
curl -X GET \
  'https://platform.adobe.io/data/foundation/connectors/landingzone?type=user_drop_zone' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer {ACCESS_TOKEN}' \
  -H 'x-api-key: {API_KEY}' \
  -H 'x-gw-ims-org-id: {ORG_ID}' \
  -H 'x-sandbox-name: {SANDBOX_NAME}' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' 
```

**Response**

The following response returns information on a landing zone, including its corresponding `containerName` and `containerTTL`.

```json
{
    "containerName": "dlz-user-container",
    "containerTTL": "7"
}
```

| Property | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `containerName` | The name of the landing zone you retrieved. |
| `containerTTL` | The expiration time (in days) applied to your data within the landing zone. Any within a given landing zone is deleted after seven days. |

## Retrieve [!DNL Data Landing Zone] credentials

To retrieve credentials for a [!DNL Data Landing Zone], make a GET request to the `/credentials` endpoint of the [!DNL Connectors] API.

**API format**

```http
GET /data/foundation/connectors/landingzone/credentials?type=user_drop_zone
```

**Request**

The following request example retrieves credentials for an existing landing zone.

```shell
curl -X GET \
  'https://platform.adobe.io/data/foundation/connectors/landingzone/credentials?type=user_drop_zone' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer {ACCESS_TOKEN}' \
  -H 'x-api-key: {API_KEY}' \
  -H 'x-gw-ims-org-id: {ORG_ID}' \
  -H 'x-sandbox-name: {SANDBOX_NAME}' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
```

**Response**

The following response returns the credential information for your data landing zone, including your current `SASToken`, `SASUri`, `storageAccountName`, and expiry date.

```json
{
    "containerName": "dlz-user-container",
    "SASToken": "sv=2020-04-08&si=dlz-ed86a61d-201f-4b50-b10f-a1bf173066fd&sr=c&sp=racwdlm&sig=4yTba8voU3L0wlcLAv9mZLdZ7NlMahbfYYPTMkQ6ZGU%3D",

### Use `determineProperties` to auto-detect file property information of a [!DNL Data Landing Zone]

You can use the `determineProperties` parameter to auto-detect property information of the file contents of your [!DNL Data Landing Zone] when making a GET call to explore the contents and structure of your source.

#### `determineProperties` uses cases

The following table outlines different scenarios you can encounter when using the `determineProperties` query parameter or manually providing information on your file.

| `determineProperties` | `queryParams` | Response |
| --- | --- | --- |
| True | N/A | If `determineProperties` is provided as a query parameter, then the file properties detection occurs and the response returns a new `properties` key that includes information on file type, compression type, and column delimiter. |
| N/A | True | If the values for file type, compression type, and column delimiter are manually provided as part of `queryParams`, then they are used to generate the schema and the same properties are returned as part of the response. |
| True | True | If both options are done simultaneously, then an error is returned. |
| N/A | N/A | If neither of the two options are provided, then an error is returned because there is no way to get properties for the response. |

**API format**

```http
GET /connectionSpecs/{CONNECTION_SPEC_ID}/explore?objectType=file&object={OBJECT}&fileType={FILE_TYPE}&preview={PREVIEW}&determineProperties=true
```

| Parameter | Description | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `determineProperties` | This query parameter allows the [!DNL Flow Service] API to detect information regarding the properties of your file, including information on file type, compression type, and column delimiter. | `true` |

**Request**

```shell
curl -X GET \
    'https://platform.adobe.io/data/foundation/flowservice/connectionSpecs/26f526f2-58f4-4712-961d-e41bf1ccc0e8/explore?objectType=file&object=dlz-user-container/garageWeek/file1&preview=true&determineProperties=true' \
    -H 'Authorization: Bearer {ACCESS_TOKEN}' \
    -H 'x-api-key: {API_KEY}' \
    -H 'x-gw-ims-org-id: {ORG_ID}' \
    -H 'x-sandbox-name: {SANDBOX_NAME}'
```

**Response**

A successful response returns the structure of the queried file including file names and data types, as well as a `properties` key, containing information on `fileType`, `compressionType`, and `columnDelimiter`.

## Create a source connection

A source connection creates and manages the connection to the external source from where data is ingested. A source connection consists of information like data source, data format, and the source connection ID needed to create a dataflow. A source connection instance is specific to a tenant and organization.

To create a source connection, make a POST request to the `/sourceConnections` endpoint of the [!DNL Flow Service] API.


**API format**

```http
POST /sourceConnections
```

**Request**

```shell
curl -X POST \
    'https://platform.adobe.io/data/foundation/flowservice/sourceConnections' \
    -H 'Authorization: Bearer {ACCESS_TOKEN}' \
    -H 'x-api-key: {API_KEY}' \
    -H 'x-gw-ims-org-id: {ORG_ID}' \
    -H 'x-sandbox-name: {SANDBOX_NAME}' \
    -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    -d '{
