# Create an [!DNL Apache] HDFS base connection using the [!DNL Flow Service] API

>[!NOTE]
>
>The Apache HDFS connector is in beta. See the [Sources overview](../../../../home.md#terms-and-conditions) for more information on using beta-labeled connectors.

A base connection represents the authenticated connection between a source and Adobe Experience Platform.

This tutorial walks you through the steps to create a base connection for [!DNL Apache Hadoop Distributed File System] (hereinafter referred to as "[!DNL HDFS]") using the [[!DNL Flow Service] API](https://www.adobe.io/experience-platform-apis/references/flow-service/).

## Getting started

This guide requires a working understanding of the following components of Adobe Experience Platform:

* [Sources](../../../../home.md): [!DNL Experience Platform] allows data to be ingested from various sources while providing you with the ability to structure, label, and enhance incoming data using [!DNL Platform] services.
* [Sandboxes](../../../../../sandboxes/home.md): [!DNL Experience Platform] provides virtual sandboxes which partition a single [!DNL Platform] instance into separate virtual environments to help develop and evolve digital experience applications.

The following sections provide additional information that you will need to know in order to successfully connect to [!DNL HDFS] using the [!DNL Flow Service] API.

### Gather required credentials

| Credential | Description |
| ---------- | ----------- |
| `url` | The URL defines auth params required for connecting to [!DNL HDFS] anonymously. For more information on how to obtain this value, refer to [this [!DNL HDFS] document](https://hadoop.apache.org/docs/r1.2.1/HttpAuthentication.html). |
| `connectionSpec.id` | The connection specification returns a source's connector properties, including authentication specifications related to creating the base and source connections. The connection specification ID for [!DNL AdWords] is: `54e221aa-d342-4707-bcff-7a4bceef0001`. |

### Using Platform APIs

For information on how to successfully make calls to Platform APIs, see the guide on [getting started with Platform APIs](../../../../../landing/api-guide.md).

## Create a base connection

A base connection retains information between your source and Platform, including your source's authentication credentials, the current state of the connection, and your unique base connection ID. The base connection ID allows you to explore and navigate files from within your source and identify the specific items that you want to ingest, including information regarding their data types and formats.

To create a base connection ID, make a POST request to the `/connections` endpoint while providing your [!DNL HDFS] authentication credentials as part of the request parameters.

**API format**

```http
POST /connections
```

**Request**

The following request creates a base connection for [!DNL HDFS]:

```shell
curl -X POST \
    'https://platform.adobe.io/data/foundation/flowservice/connections' \
    -H 'Authorization: Bearer {ACCESS_TOKEN}' \
    -H 'x-api-key: {API_KEY}' \
    -H 'x-gw-ims-org-id: {ORG_ID}' \
    -H 'x-sandbox-name: {SANDBOX_NAME}' \
    -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    -d '{
        "name": "HDFS test connection",
        "description": "A test connection for an HDFS source",
        "auth": {
            "specName": "Anonymous Authentication",
            "params": {
                "url": "{URL}"
                }
        },
        "connectionSpec": {
            "id": "54e221aa-d342-4707-bcff-7a4bceef0001",
            "version": "1.0"
        }
    }'
```

| Property | Description |
| --------- | ----------- |
| `auth.params.url` | The URL that defines auth params required for connecting to [!DNL HDFS] anonymously |
| `connectionSpec.id` | The [!DNL HDFS] connection specification ID: `54e221aa-d342-4707-bcff-7a4bceef0001`. |

**Response**

A successful response returns details of the newly created connection, including its unique identifier (`id`). This ID is required to explore your data in the next tutorial.

```json
{
    "id": "6a6a880a-2b15-4051-aa88-0a2b1570516d",
    "etag": "\"1801bb7d-0000-0200-0000-5ed6ad580000\""
}
```

## Next steps

By following this tutorial, you have created an [!DNL HDFS] connection using the [!DNL Flow Service] API and have obtained the connection's unique ID value. You can use this ID in the next tutorial as you learn how to [explore a third-party cloud storage using the Flow Service API](../../explore/cloud-storage.md).
