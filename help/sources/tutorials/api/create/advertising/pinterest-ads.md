# (Beta) Create a source connection and dataflow for [!DNL Pinterest Ads] using the [!DNL Flow Service] API

>[!NOTE]
>
>The [!DNL Pinterest Ads] source is in beta. See the [sources overview](../../../../home.md#terms-and-conditions) for more information on using beta-labelled sources.

The following tutorial walks you through the steps to create a [!DNL Pinterest Ads] source connection and create a dataflow to bring [[!DNL Pinterest Ads]](https://ads.pinterest.com/) data to Adobe Experience Platform using the [[!DNL Flow Service] API](https://www.adobe.io/experience-platform-apis/references/flow-service/).

## Getting started {#getting-started}

This guide requires a working understanding of the following components of Experience Platform:

* [Sources](../../../../home.md): Experience Platform allows data to be ingested from various sources while providing you with the ability to structure, label, and enhance incoming data using Platform services.
* [Sandboxes](../../../../../sandboxes/home.md): Experience Platform provides virtual sandboxes which partition a single Platform instance into separate virtual environments to help develop and evolve digital experience applications.

The following sections provide additional information that you will need to know in order to successfully connect to [!DNL Pinterest Ads] using the [!DNL Flow Service] API.

## Prerequisites {#prerequisites}

In order to connect [!DNL Pinterest Ads] to Experience Platform, you must provide values for the following connection properties:

* The [!DNL Pinterest] `Access Token`.
* The [!DNL Pinterest] `Ad Account ID`.
* One of [!DNL Pinterest] `Campaign`, `Ad Group` or `Ad` ID's as required.

For more information on each of these, see their individual sections within the [!DNL Pinterest] [prerequisites](../../../../connectors/advertising/pinterest-ads.md#prerequisites) overview documentation.

## Connect [!DNL Pinterest Ads] to Platform using the [!DNL Flow Service] API {#connect-platform-to-flow-api}

The following tutorial walks you through the steps to create a [!DNL Pinterest Ads] source connection and create a dataflow to bring [!DNL Pinterest Ads] data to Platform using the [[!DNL Flow Service] API](https://www.adobe.io/experience-platform-apis/references/flow-service/).

### Create a base connection {#base-connection}

A base connection retains information between your source and Platform, including your source's authentication credentials, the current state of the connection, and your unique base connection ID. The base connection ID allows you to explore and navigate files from within your source and identify the specific items that you want to ingest, including information regarding their data types and formats.

To create a base connection ID, make a POST request to the `/connections` endpoint while providing your [!DNL Pinterest Ads] authentication credentials as part of the request body.

**API format**

```https
POST /connections
```

**Request**

The following request creates a base connection for [!DNL Pinterest Ads]:

```shell
curl -X POST \
    'https://platform.adobe.io/data/foundation/flowservice/connections' \
    -H 'Authorization: Bearer {ACCESS_TOKEN}' \
    -H 'x-api-key: {API_KEY}' \
    -H 'x-gw-ims-org-id: {ORG_ID}' \
    -H 'x-sandbox-name: {SANDBOX_NAME}' \
    -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    -d '{
        "name": "Pinterest Ads",
        "description": "Create a live inbound connection to your Pinterest Ads instance, to ingest both historic and scheduled data into Experience Platform",
        "connectionSpec": {
            "id": "f82aae23-91e7-4884-b25f-2d2159d841fd",
            "version": "1.0"
        },
        "auth": {
            "specName": "OAuth2 Refresh Code",
            "params": {  
                "accessToken": "{PINTEREST_ACCESS_TOKEN}"
        }
    }'
```

| Property | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `name` | The name of your base connection. Ensure that the name of your base connection is descriptive as you can use this to look up information on your base connection. |
| `description` | An optional value that you can include to provide more information on your base connection. |
| `connectionSpec.id` | The connection specification ID of your source. This ID can be retrieved after your source is registered and approved through the [!DNL Flow Service] API. |
| `auth.specName` | The authentication type that you are using to authenticate your source to Platform. |
| `auth.params.accessToken` | Contains the [!DNL Pinterest] Access Token value required to authenticate your source. |

**Response**

A successful response returns the newly created base connection, including its unique connection identifier (`id`). This ID is required to explore your source's file structure and contents in the next step.

```json
{
    "id": "f5421911-6f6c-41c7-aafa-5d9d2ce51535",
    "etag": "\"4d08164f-0000-0200-0000-6368b7bf0000\""
}
```

### Explore your source {#explore}

Using the base connection ID you generated in the previous step, you can explore files and directories by performing GET requests.
Use the following calls to find the path of the file you wish to bring into [!DNL Platform]:

**API format**

```http
GET /connections/{BASE_CONNECTION_ID}/explore?objectType=rest&object={OBJECT}&fileType={FILE_TYPE}&preview={PREVIEW}&sourceParams={SOURCE_PARAMS}
```

When performing GET requests to explore your source's file structure and contents, you must include the query parameters that are listed in the table below:


| Parameter | Description |
| --------- | ----------- |
| `{BASE_CONNECTION_ID}` | The base connection ID generated in the previous step. |
| `objectType=rest` | The type of object that you wish to explore. Currently, this value is always set to `rest`. |
| `{OBJECT}` | This parameter is required only when viewing a specific directory. Its value represents the path of the directory you wish to explore. |
| `fileType=json` | The file type of the file you want to bring to Platform. Currently, `json` is the only supported file type. |
| `{PREVIEW}` | A boolean value that defines whether the contents of the connection supports preview. |
| `{SOURCE_PARAMS}` | Defines parameters for the source file you want to bring to Platform. To retrieve the accepted format-type for `{SOURCE_PARAMS}`, you must encode the entire `{"ad_account_id":"{PINTEREST_AD_ACCOUNT_ID}","object_ids":"{COMMA_SEPERATED_OBJECT_IDS}","object_type":"{OBJECT_TYPE}}"}` string in base64. |

[!DNL Pinterest Ads] supports multiple [!DNL Pinterest] Analytics API endpoints. Depending on which object type you are leveraging the request to be sent is as below:

**Request**

>[!BEGINTABS]

>[!TAB Campaigns]

For [!DNL Pinterest Ads], when leveraging the Campaign Analytics API the value for `{SOURCE_PARAMS}` is passed as `{"ad_account_id":"123456789000","object_ids":"000123456789","object_type":"campaigns"}`. When encoded in base64, it equates to `YHsiYWRfYWNjb3VudF9pZCI6IjEyMzQ1Njc4OTAwMCIsIm9iamVjdF9pZHMiOiIwMDAxMjM0NTY3ODkiLCJvYmplY3RfdHlwZSI6ImNhbXBhaWducyJ9` as shown below.

### Create a target XDM schema {#target-schema}

In order for the source data to be used in Platform, a target schema must be created to structure the source data according to your needs. The target schema is then used to create a Platform dataset in which the source data is contained.

A target XDM schema can be created by performing a POST request to the [Schema Registry API](https://developer.adobe.com/experience-platform-apis/references/schema-registry/).

For detailed steps on how to create a target XDM schema, see the tutorial on [creating a schema using the API](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-platform/xdm/api/schemas.html?lang=en#create).

### Create a target dataset {#target-dataset}

A target dataset can be created by performing a POST request to the [Catalog Service API](https://www.adobe.io/apis/experienceplatform/home/api-reference.html#!acpdr/swagger-specs/catalog.yaml), providing the ID of the target schema within the payload.

For detailed steps on how to create a target dataset, see the tutorial on [creating a dataset using the API](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-platform/catalog/api/create-dataset.html?lang=en).

### Create a target connection {#target-connection}

A target connection represents the connection to the destination where the ingested data is to be stored. To create a target connection, you must provide the fixed connection specification ID that corresponds to the [!DNL Data Lake]. This ID is: `c604ff05-7f1a-43c0-8e18-33bf874cb11c`.

You now have the unique identifiers a target schema a target dataset and the connection spec ID to the [!DNL Data Lake]. Using these identifiers, you can create a target connection using the [!DNL Flow Service] API to specify the dataset that will contain the inbound source data.

**API format**

```https
POST /targetConnections
```

**Request**

The following request creates a target connection for [!DNL Pinterest Ads]:

```shell

     "etag": "\"a196f685-f5e8-4c4c-bfbd-136141bb0c6d\""
}
```

### Create a mapping {#mapping}

In order for the source data to be ingested into a target dataset, it must first be mapped to the target schema that the target dataset adheres to. This is achieved by performing a POST request to [[!DNL Data Prep] API](https://www.adobe.io/experience-platform-apis/references/data-prep/) with data mappings defined within the request payload.

**API format**

```http
POST /conversion/mappingSets
```

    "createdBy": "{CREATED_BY}",
    "modifiedBy": "{MODIFIED_BY}"
}
```

### Create a flow {#flow}

The last step towards bringing data from [!DNL Pinterest Ads] to Platform is to create a dataflow. By now, you have the following required values prepared:

* [Source connection ID](#source-connection)
* [Target connection ID](#target-connection)
* [Mapping ID](#mapping)

A dataflow is responsible for scheduling and collecting data from a source. You can create a dataflow by performing a POST request while providing the previously mentioned values within the payload.

To schedule an ingestion, you must first set the start time value to epoch time in seconds. Then, you must set the frequency value to one of the five options: `once`, `minute`, `hour`, `day`, or `week`. The interval value designates the period between two consecutive ingestions however, creating a one-time ingestion does not require an interval to be set. For all other frequencies, the interval value must be set to equal or greater than `15`.
