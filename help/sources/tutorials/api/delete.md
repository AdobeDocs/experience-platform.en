# Delete an account using the Flow Service API

Adobe Experience Platform allows data to be ingested from external sources while providing you with the ability to structure, label, and enhance incoming data using [!DNL Platform] services. You can ingest data from a variety of sources such as Adobe applications, cloud-based storage, databases, and many others.

[!DNL Flow Service] is used to collect and centralize customer data from various disparate sources within Adobe Experience Platform. The service provides a user interface and RESTful API from which all supported sources are connectable.

This tutorial covers the steps for deleting using the [[!DNL Flow Service] API](https://www.adobe.io/experience-platform-apis/references/flow-service/).

## Getting started

This tutorial requires you to have a valid connection ID. If you do not have a valid connection ID, select your connector of choice from the [sources overview](../../home.md) and follow the steps outlined before attempting this tutorial.

This tutorial also requires you to have a working understanding of the following components of Adobe Experience Platform:

* [Sources](../../home.md): [!DNL Experience Platform] allows data to be ingested from various sources while providing you with the ability to structure, label, and enhance incoming data using [!DNL Platform] services.
* [Sandboxes](../../../sandboxes/home.md): [!DNL Experience Platform] provides virtual sandboxes which partition a single [!DNL Platform] instance into separate virtual environments to help develop and evolve digital experience applications.

The following sections provide additional information that you will need to know in order to successfully delete a connection using the [!DNL Flow Service] API.

### Reading sample API calls

This tutorial provides example API calls to demonstrate how to format your requests. These include paths, required headers, and properly formatted request payloads. Sample JSON returned in API responses is also provided. For information on the conventions used in documentation for sample API calls, see the section on [how to read example API calls](../../../landing/troubleshooting.md#how-do-i-format-an-api-request) in the [!DNL Experience Platform] troubleshooting guide.

### Gather values for required headers

In order to make calls to [!DNL Platform] APIs, you must first complete the [authentication tutorial](https://www.adobe.com/go/platform-api-authentication-en). Completing the authentication tutorial provides the values for each of the required headers in all [!DNL Experience Platform] API calls, as shown below:

* `Authorization: Bearer {ACCESS_TOKEN}`
* `x-api-key: {API_KEY}`
* `x-gw-ims-org-id: {IMS_ORG}`

All resources in [!DNL Experience Platform], including those belonging to [!DNL Flow Service], are isolated to specific virtual sandboxes. All requests to [!DNL Platform] APIs require a header that specifies the name of the sandbox the operation will take place in:

* `x-sandbox-name: {SANDBOX_NAME}`

All requests that contain a payload (POST, PUT, PATCH) require an additional media type header:

* `Content-Type: application/json`

## Look up connection details

>[!NOTE]
>This tutorial uses the [Azure Blob source connector](../../connectors/cloud-storage/blob.md) as an example, but the steps outlined apply to any of the [available source connectors](../../home.md).

The first step in updating your connection information is to retrieve connection details using your connection ID.

**API format**

```http
GET /connections/{CONNECTION_ID}
```

| Parameter | Description |
| --------- | ----------- |
| `{CONNECTION_ID}` | The unique `id` value for the connection you want to retrieve. |

**Request**

The following retrieves information regarding your connection ID.

```shell
curl -X GET \
    'https://platform.adobe.io/data/foundation/flowservice/connections/dd3631cd-d0ea-4fea-b631-cdd0ea6fea21' \
    -H 'Authorization: Bearer {ACCESS_TOKEN}' \
    -H 'x-api-key: {API_KEY}' \
    -H 'x-gw-ims-org-id: {IMS_ORG}' \
    -H 'x-sandbox-name: {SANDBOX_NAME}'
```

**Response**

A successful response returns the current details of your connection including its credentials, unique identifier (`id`), and version.

```json
{
    "items": [
        {
            "createdAt": 1603514659165,
            "updatedAt": 1603514659165,
            "createdBy": "{CREATED_BY}",
            "updatedBy": "{UPDATED_BY}",
            "createdClient": "{CREATED_CLIENT}",
            "updatedClient": "{UPDATED_CLIENT",
            "sandboxId": "{SANDBOX_ID}",
            "sandboxName": "{SANDBOX_NAME}",
            "id": "dd3631cd-d0ea-4fea-b631-cdd0ea6fea21",
            "name": "Test Azure Blob Connector",
            "description": "A test connector for Azure Blob",
            "connectionSpec": {
                "id": "4c10e202-c428-4796-9208-5f1f5732b1cf",
                "version": "1.0"
            },
            "state": "enabled",
            "auth": {
                "specName": "ConnectionString",
                "params": {
                    "connectionString": "xxxx"
                }
            },
            "version": "\"07001eed-0000-0200-0000-5f93b1250000\"",
            "etag": "\"07001eed-0000-0200-0000-5f93b1250000\""
        }
    ]
}
```

## Delete connection

Once you have an existing connection ID, perform a DELETE request to the [!DNL Flow Service] API.

**API format**

```http
DELETE /connections/{CONNECTION_ID}
```

| Parameter | Description |
| --------- | ----------- |
| `{CONNECTION_ID}` | The unique `id` value for the connection you want to delete. |

**Request**

```shell
curl -X DELETE \
    'https://platform-int.adobe.io/data/foundation/flowservice/connections/dd3631cd-d0ea-4fea-b631-cdd0ea6fea21' \
    -H 'Authorization: Bearer {ACCESS_TOKEN}' \
    -H 'x-api-key: {API_KEY}' \
    -H 'x-gw-ims-org-id: {IMS_ORG}' \
    -H 'x-sandbox-name: {SANDBOX_NAME}'
```

**Response**

A successful response returns HTTP status 204 (No Content) and a blank body.

You can confirm the deletion by attempting a lookup (GET) request to the connection.

## Next steps

By following this tutorial, you have successfully used the [!DNL Flow Service] API to delete existing accounts.

For steps on how to perform these operations using the user interface, please refer to the tutorial on [deleting accounts in the UI](../../tutorials/ui/delete-accounts.md)
