# Ingest Parquet data from a third-party cloud storage system using the [!DNL Flow Service] API

[!DNL Flow Service] is used to collect and centralize customer data from various disparate sources within Adobe Experience Platform. The service provides a user interface and RESTful API from which all supported sources are connectable.

This tutorial uses the [!DNL Flow Service] API to walk you through the steps to ingest Parquet data from a third-party cloud storage system.

## Getting started

This guide requires a working understanding of the following components of Adobe Experience Platform:

- [Sources](../../home.md): [!DNL Experience Platform] allows data to be ingested from various sources while providing you with the ability to structure, label, and enhance incoming data using [!DNL Platform] services.
- [Sandboxes](../../../sandboxes/home.md): [!DNL Experience Platform] provides virtual sandboxes which partition a single [!DNL Platform] instance into separate virtual environments to help develop and evolve digital experience applications.

The following sections provide additional information that you will need to know in order to successfully ingest Parquet data from a third-party cloud storage using the [!DNL Flow Service] API.

### Reading sample API calls

This tutorial provides example API calls to demonstrate how to format your requests. These include paths, required headers, and properly formatted request payloads. Sample JSON returned in API responses is also provided. For information on the conventions used in documentation for sample API calls, see the section on [how to read example API calls](../../../landing/troubleshooting.md#how-do-i-format-an-api-request) in the [!DNL Experience Platform] troubleshooting guide.

### Gather values for required headers

In order to make calls to [!DNL Platform] APIs, you must first complete the [authentication tutorial](https://www.adobe.com/go/platform-api-authentication-en). Completing the authentication tutorial provides the values for each of the required headers in all [!DNL Experience Platform] API calls, as shown below:

- `Authorization: Bearer {ACCESS_TOKEN}`
- `x-api-key: {API_KEY}`
- `x-gw-ims-org-id: {ORG_ID}`

All resources in [!DNL Experience Platform], including those belonging to [!DNL Flow Service], are isolated to specific virtual sandboxes. All requests to [!DNL Platform] APIs require a header that specifies the name of the sandbox the operation will take place in:

- `x-sandbox-name: {SANDBOX_NAME}`

All requests that contain a payload (POST, PUT, PATCH) require an additional media type header:

- `Content-Type: application/json`
  
## Create a connection

In order to ingest Parquet data using [!DNL Platform] APIs, you must possess a valid connection for the third-party cloud storage source you are accessing. If you do not already have a connection for the storage you wish to work with, you can create one through the following tutorials:

- [Amazon S3](./create/cloud-storage/s3.md)
- [Azure Blob](./create/cloud-storage/blob.md)
- [Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2](./create/cloud-storage/adls-gen2.md)
- [Google Cloud Store](./create/cloud-storage/google.md)
- [SFTP](./create/cloud-storage/sftp.md)

Obtain and store the unique identifier (`$id`) of the connection and then proceed to the next step of this tutorial.

## Create a target schema

In order for the source data to be used in [!DNL Platform], a target schema must also be created to structure the source data according to your needs. The target schema is then used to create a [!DNL Platform] dataset in which the source data is contained.

If you would prefer to use the user interface in [!DNL Experience Platform], the [Schema Editor tutorial](../../../xdm/tutorials/create-schema-ui.md) provides step-by-step instructions for performing similar actions in the Schema Editor.

**API format**

```http
POST /schemaregistry/tenant/schemas
```

**Request**

The following example request creates an XDM schema that extends the XDM [!DNL Individual Profile] class.

```shell
curl -X POST \
    'https://platform.adobe.io/data/foundation/schemaregistry/tenant/schemas' \
    -H 'Authorization: Bearer {ACCESS_TOKEN}' \
    -H 'x-api-key: {API_KEY}' \
    -H 'x-gw-ims-org-id: {ORG_ID}' \
    -H 'x-sandbox-name: {SANDBOX_NAME}' \
    -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    -d '{
    "type": "object",
    "title": "Sample Demo Profile XDM {{$guid}}",
    "description": "",
    "allOf": [
        {

    "meta:class": "https://ns.adobe.com/xdm/context/profile"
}'
```

**Response**

A successful response returns details of the newly created schema including its unique identifier (`$id`). This ID is required in the next step to create a source connection.

```json

## Create a source connection {#source}

With a target XDM schema created, a source connection can now be created using a POST request to the [!DNL Flow Service] API. A source connection consists of a connection for the API, a source data format, and a reference to the target XDM schema retrieved in the previous step.

**API format**

```http
POST /sourceConnections
```

**Request**

```shell
curl -X POST \
    'http://platform.adobe.io/data/foundation/flowservice/sourceConnections' \
    -H 'Authorization: Bearer {ACCESS_TOKEN}' \
    -H 'x-api-key: {API_KEY}' \
    -H 'x-gw-ims-org-id: {ORG_ID}' \
    -H 'x-sandbox-name: {SANDBOX_NAME}' \
    -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    -d '{
        "name": "Source Connection S3 {{$guid}}",
        "baseConnectionId": "5831c52c-c261-4945-b1c5-2cc261d945b2",
        "connectionSpec": {
            "id": "ecadc60c-7455-4d87-84dc-2a0e293d997b",
            "version": 1
        },
        "data": {
            "format": "parquet_xdm",
            "schema": {
                "id": "https://ns.adobe.com/{TENANT_ID}/schemas/e15530faf88aeb52d9ca5c5671a059f44f1a42ea7f5fdb80",
                "id": "",
                "version": "application/vnd.adobe.xed-full+json;version=1"
            }
        },
        "params": {
            "path": "partners-demo/samples",
            "recursive": "true"
        }
    }'
```

| Property | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| `baseConnectionId` | The connection for the API that represents your cloud storage. |
| `data.schema.id` | The (`$id`) if the target xdm schema retrieved in the previous step. |
| `params.path` | The path of the source file. |

**Response**

A successful response returns the unique identifier (`id`) of the newly created source connection. Store this value as it is required in later steps for creating a target connection.

```json
{
    "id": "73bc8911-505a-4e46-bc89-11505a6e466f",
    "etag": "\"c4004435-0000-0200-0000-5e7437d90000\""
}
```

## Create a dataset base connection

In order to ingest external data into [!DNL Platform], an [!DNL Experience Platform] dataset base connection must first be acquired.

To create a dataset base connection, follow the steps outlined in the [dataset base connection tutorial](./create-dataset-base-connection.md).

Continue following the steps outlined in the developer guide until you have created a dataset base connection. Obtain and store the unique identifier (`$id`) and proceed to use it as the base connection ID in the next step to create a target connection.

## Create a target dataset

A target dataset can be created by performing a POST request to the [Catalog Service API](https://www.adobe.io/experience-platform-apis/references/catalog/), providing the ID of the target schema within the payload.

**API format**

```http
POST /catalog/dataSets
```

**Request**

```shell
curl -X POST \
    'https://platform.adobe.io/data/foundation/catalog/dataSets?requestDataSource=true' \
    -H 'Authorization: Bearer {ACCESS_TOKEN}' \
    -H 'x-api-key: {API_KEY}' \
    -H 'x-gw-ims-org-id: {ORG_ID}' \
    -H 'x-sandbox-name: {SANDBOX_NAME}' \
    -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    -d '{
        "name": "Leads Dataset {{$guid}}",
        "schemaRef": {
            "id": ""https://ns.adobe.com/{TENANT_ID}/schemas/e15530faf88aeb52d9ca5c5671a059f44f1a42ea7f5fdb80"",
            "contentType": "application/vnd.adobe.xed-full-notext+json; version=1"
        }
    }'
```

| Property | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| `schemaRef.id` | The ID of your target XDM schema. |

**Response**

A successful response returns an array containing the ID of the newly created dataset in the format `"@/datasets/{DATASET_ID}"`. The dataset ID is a read-only, system-generated string that is used to reference the dataset in API calls. Store the target dataset ID as it is required in later steps to create a target connection and a dataflow.

```json
[
    "@/dataSets/5e7439b1ad55a618ad4c5102"
]
```

## Create a target connection {#target}

You now have the unique identifiers for a dataset base connection, a target schema, and a target dataset. Using these identifiers, you can create a target connection using the [!DNL Flow Service] API to specify the dataset that will contain the inbound source data.

**API format**

```http
POST /targetConnections
```

**Request**

```shell
curl -X POST \
    'http://platform.adobe.io/data/foundation/flowservice/targetConnections' \
    -H 'Authorization: Bearer {ACCESS_TOKEN}' \
    -H 'x-api-key: {API_KEY}' \
    -H 'x-gw-ims-org-id: {ORG_ID}' \
    -H 'x-sandbox-name: {SANDBOX_NAME}' \
    -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    -d '{
        "baseConnectionId": "291257e3-c560-4e07-9257-e3c5606e07d1",
        "connectionSpec": {
            "id":"c604ff05-7f1a-43c0-8e18-33bf874cb11c",
            "version": "1.0"
        },
        "name": "Target Connection {{$guid}}",
        "data": {
            "format": "parquet_xdm",
            "schema": {
                "id": ""https://ns.adobe.com/{TENANT_ID}/schemas/e15530faf88aeb52d9ca5c5671a059f44f1a42ea7f5fdb80"",
                "version": "application/vnd.adobe.xed-full+json;version=1"
            }
        },
        "params": {
            "dataSetId": "5e7439b1ad55a618ad4c5102"
        }
    }'
```

| Property | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| `baseConnectionId` | The ID of your dataset base connection. |
| `data.schema.id` | The `$id` of the target XDM schema. |
| `params.dataSetId` | The ID of the target dataset. |
| `connectionSpec.id` | The connection specification ID for your cloud storage. |

**Response**

A successful response returns the new target connection's unique identifier (`id`). Store this value as it is required in later steps.

```json
{
    "id": "9b3abc95-f2e9-47c1-babc-95f2e927c1ec",
    "etag": "\"7501936b-0000-0200-0000-5e743bcc0000\""
}
```

## Create a dataflow

The last step towards ingesting Parquet data from a third-party cloud storage is to create a dataflow. By now, you have the following required values prepared:

- [Source connection ID](#source)
- [Target connection ID](#target)

A dataflow is responsible for scheduling and collecting data from a source. You can create a dataflow by performing a POST request while providing the previously mentioned values within the payload.

**API format**

```http
POST /flows
```

**Request**

```shell
curl -X POST \
    'https://platform.adobe.io/data/foundation/flowservice/flows' \
    -H 'x-api-key: {API_KEY}' \
    -H 'x-gw-ims-org-id: {ORG_ID}' \
    -H 'x-sandbox-name: {SANDBOX_NAME}' \
    -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    -d '{
        "name": "Demo Parquet Ingestion Flow {{$guid}}",
        "flowSpec": {
            "id": "9753525b-82c7-4dce-8a9b-5ccfce2b9876",
            "version": "1.0"
        },
        "sourceConnectionIds": [
            "73bc8911-505a-4e46-bc89-11505a6e466f"
        ],
        "targetConnectionIds": [
            "9b3abc95-f2e9-47c1-babc-95f2e927c1ec"
        ],
        "scheduleParams": {
            "startTime": {{$timestamp}},
            "frequency": "minute",
            "interval": 1000,
            "backfill": true
        }
    }'
```

| Property | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| `sourceConnectionIds` | The source connection ID retrieved in an earlier step. |
| `targetConnectionIds` | The target connection ID retrieved in an earlier step. |

**Response**

A successful response returns the ID (`id`) of the newly created dataflow.

```json
{
    "id": "89ff50ef-b082-426e-bf50-efb082d26e78",
    "etag": "\"890070b8-0000-0200-0000-5e743c040000\""
}
```

## Next steps

By following this tutorial, you have created a source connector to collect Parquet data from your third-party cloud storage system on a scheduled basis. Incoming data can now be used by downstream [!DNL Platform] services such as [!DNL Real-time Customer Profile] and [!DNL Data Science Workspace]. See the following documents for more details:

- [Real-time Customer Profile overview](../../../profile/home.md)
- [Data Science Workspace overview](../../../data-science-workspace/home.md)
