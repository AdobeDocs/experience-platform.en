# Update accounts using the Flow Service API

In some circumstances, it may be required to update the details of an existing source connection. [!DNL Flow Service] provides you with the ability to add, edit, and delete details of an existing batch or streaming connection, including its name, description, and credentials.

This tutorial covers the steps for updating the details and credentials of a connection using the [[!DNL Flow Service] API](https://www.adobe.io/experience-platform-apis/references/flow-service/).

## Getting started

This tutorial requires you to have an existing connection and a valid connection ID. If you do not have an existing connection, select your source of choice from the [sources overview](../../home.md) and follow the steps outlined before attempting this tutorial.

This tutorial also requires you to have a working understanding of the following components of Adobe Experience Platform:

* [Sources](../../home.md): Experience Platform allows data to be ingested from various sources while providing you with the ability to structure, label, and enhance incoming data using Platform services.
* [Sandboxes](../../../sandboxes/home.md): Experience Platform provides virtual sandboxes which partition a single Platform instance into separate virtual environments to help develop and evolve digital experience applications.

The following sections provide additional information that you will need to know in order to successfully update a connection using the [!DNL Flow Service] API.

### Reading sample API calls

This tutorial provides example API calls to demonstrate how to format your requests. These include paths, required headers, and properly formatted request payloads. Sample JSON returned in API responses is also provided. For information on the conventions used in documentation for sample API calls, see the section on [how to read example API calls](../../../landing/troubleshooting.md#how-do-i-format-an-api-request) in the Experience Platform troubleshooting guide.

### Gather values for required headers

In order to make calls to Platform APIs, you must first complete the [authentication tutorial](https://www.adobe.com/go/platform-api-authentication-en). Completing the authentication tutorial provides the values for each of the required headers in all Experience Platform API calls, as shown below:

* `Authorization: Bearer {ACCESS_TOKEN}`
* `x-api-key: {API_KEY}`
* `x-gw-ims-org-id: {IMS_ORG}`

All resources in Experience Platform, including those belonging to [!DNL Flow Service], are isolated to specific virtual sandboxes. All requests to Platform APIs require a header that specifies the name of the sandbox the operation will take place in:

* `x-sandbox-name: {SANDBOX_NAME}`

All requests that contain a payload (POST, PUT, PATCH) require an additional media type header:

* `Content-Type: application/json`

## Look up connection details

The first step in updating your connection is to retrieve its details using your connection ID. To retrieve your connection's current details make a GET request to the [!DNL Flow Service] API while providing the connection ID, of the connection you want to update.

**API format**

```http
GET /connections/{CONNECTION_ID}
```

| Parameter | Description |
| --------- | ----------- |
| `{CONNECTION_ID}` | The unique `id` value for the connection you want to retrieve. |

**Request**

The following request retrieves information regarding your connection.

```shell
curl -X GET \
    'https://platform.adobe.io/data/foundation/flowservice/connections/139f6a5f-a78b-4744-9f6a-5fa78bd74431' \
    -H 'Authorization: Bearer {ACCESS_TOKEN}' \
    -H 'x-api-key: {API_KEY}' \
    -H 'x-gw-ims-org-id: {IMS_ORG}' \
    -H 'x-sandbox-name: {SANDBOX_NAME}'
```

**Response**

A successful response returns the current details of your connection including its credentials, unique identifier (`id`), and version. The version value is required to update your connection.

```json
{
    "items": [
        {
            "createdAt": 1597973312000,
            "updatedAt": 1597973312000,
            "createdBy": "{CREATED_BY}",
            "updatedBy": "{UPDATED_BY}",
            "createdClient": "{CREATED_CLIENT}",
            "updatedClient": "{UPDATED_CLIENT}",
            "sandboxName": "{SANDBOX_NAME}",
            "id": "139f6a5f-a78b-4744-9f6a-5fa78bd74431",
            "name": "E2E_SF Base_Connection",
            "connectionSpec": {
                "id": "cfc0fee1-7dc0-40ef-b73e-d8b134c436f5",
                "version": "1.0"
            },
            "state": "enabled",
            "auth": {
                "specName": "Basic Authentication",
                "params": {
                    "securityToken": "{SECURITY_TOKEN}",
                    "password": "{PASSWORD}",
                    "username": "my-salesforce-account",
                    "environmentUrl": "login.salesforce.com"
                }
            },
            "version": "\"1400dd53-0000-0200-0000-5f3f23450000\"",
            "etag": "\"1400dd53-0000-0200-0000-5f3f23450000\""
        }
    ]
}
```

## Update connection

To update your connection's name, description, and credentials, perform a PATCH request to the [!DNL Flow Service] API while providing your connection ID, version, and the new information you want to use.

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>The `If-Match` header is required when making a PATCH request. The value for this header is the unique version of the connection you want to update.

**API format**

```http
PATCH /connections/{CONNECTION_ID}
```

| Parameter | Description |
| --------- | ----------- |
| `{CONNECTION_ID}` | The unique `id` value for the connection you want to update. |

**Request**

The following request provides a new name and description, as well as a new set of credentials, to update your connection with.

```shell
curl -X PATCH \
    'https://platform.adobe.io/data/foundation/flowservice/connections/139f6a5f-a78b-4744-9f6a-5fa78bd74431' \
    -H 'Authorization: Bearer {ACCESS_TOKEN}' \
    -H 'x-api-key: {API_KEY}' \
    -H 'x-gw-ims-org-id: {IMS_ORG}' \

            }
        },
        {
            "op": "replace",
            "path": "/name",
            "value": "Test salesforce connection"
        },
        {

```json
{
    "id": "139f6a5f-a78b-4744-9f6a-5fa78bd74431",
    "etag": "\"3600e378-0000-0200-0000-5f40212f0000\""
}
```
