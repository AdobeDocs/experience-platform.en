Adobe Experience Platform Sources SDK is a set of configuration APIs that allow you to integrate a REST API-based source to bring your data to Experience Platform.

With Sources SDK, you can:

* Configure a new source to the Platform catalog, complete with create, read, update, and delete functionalities, as well as abilities to test and publish the source through API-driven `connectionSpec` access;
* Define authentication types for your source;
* Publish your source to one or all IMS Organizations;
* Create user-facing documentation for your source.
