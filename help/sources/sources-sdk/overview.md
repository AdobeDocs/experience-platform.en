# (Beta) Sources SDK overview

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>Sources SDK is in beta. The feature and documentation are subject to change.

Adobe Experience Platform can ingest data from external sources while allowing you to structure, label, and enhance that data using Platform services. You can ingest data from a variety of sources such as Adobe applications, cloud-based storage, third-party software, and your CRM system.

Adobe Experience Platform Sources SDK is a set of configuration APIs that allow you to integrate a REST API-based source to bring your data to Experience Platform.

With Sources SDK, you can:

* Configure a new source to the Platform catalog, complete with create, read, update, and delete functionalities, as well as abilities to test and publish the source through API-driven `connectionSpec` access;
* Define authentication types for your source;
* Publish your source to one or all IMS Organizations;
* Create user-facing documentation for your source.
