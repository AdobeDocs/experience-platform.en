# Submit your new source

Once you have created a connection specification and added its unique ID to a flow specification, you can now proceed to test and submit your source to be added to the Adobe Experience Platform sources catalog.

Use the following [!DNL Postman] collection to test your source. If your source runs successfully, you can proceed to contact your Adobe representative to verify and submit your source.
