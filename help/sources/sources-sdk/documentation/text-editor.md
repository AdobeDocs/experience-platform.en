This document provides steps on how to use your local environment to author documentation for your source and submit a pull request (PR).

## Prerequisites

The following tutorial requires that you have GitHub Desktop installed on your local machine. If you do not have GitHub Desktop, you can download the application [here](https://desktop.github.com/).

## Connect to GitHub and set up your local authoring environment

The first step in setting up your local authoring environment is to navigate to the [Adobe Experience Platform GitHub repository](https://github.com/AdobeDocs/experience-platform.en).

![platform-repo](../assets/platform-repo.png)

On the main page of the Platform GitHub repository, select **Fork**.

![fork](../assets/fork.png)

To clone the repository to your local machine, select **Code**. From the dropdown menu that appears, select **HTTPS** and then, select **Open with GitHub Desktop**.

>For more information, see the tutorial on [setting up Git repository locally for documentation](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/contributor/contributor-guide/setup/local-repo.html#create-a-local-clone-of-the-repository).

![open-git-desktop](../assets/open-git-desktop.png)

Next, allow a few moments for GitHub Desktop to clone the `experience-platform.en` repository.

Once the cloning process is complete, head to GitHub Desktop to create a new branch. Select **Master** from the top navigation and then select **New branch**

![new-branch](../assets/new-branch.png)

In the popover panel that appears, enter a descriptive name for your branch, and then select **Create branch**.

Next, select **Publish branch**.

## Author the documentation page for your source

With the repository cloned to your local machine and a new branch created, you can now start authoring the documentation page for your new source through the [text editor of your choice](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/contributor/contributor-guide/setup/install-tools.html#understand-markdown-editors).

Adobe recommends that you use [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and that you install the Adobe Markdown Authoring extension. To install the extension, launch Visual Studio Code, and then select the **Extensions** tab from the left-navigation.

![extension](../assets/extension.png)

Next, enter `Adobe Markdown Authoring` into the search bar and then select **Install** from the page that appears.

![install](../assets/install.png)

With your local machine ready, download the [sources documentation template](../assets/api-template.zip) and extract the file to `experience-platform.en/help/sources/tutorials/api/create/...` with [`...`] representing the category of your choice. For example, if you are creating a database source, select the database folder.

Finally, follow the instructions outlined on the template and edit the template with the relevant information pertaining to your source.

## Submit your documentation for review

To create a pull request (PR) and submit your documentation for review, first save your work in [!DNL Visual Studio Code] (or your chosen text editor). Next, using GitHub Desktop, enter a commit message and select **Commit to create-source-documentation**.

![commit-vs](../assets/commit-vs.png)

Next, select **Push origin** to upload your work to the remote branch.

![push-origin](../assets/push-origin.png)

To create a pull request, select **Create Pull Request**.

![create-pr-vs](../assets/create-pr-vs.png)

Ensure that the base and compare branches are correct. Add a note to the PR, describing your update, and then select **Create pull request**. This opens a PR to merge the working branch of your work into the master branch of the Adobe repository.

>[!TIP]
>
>Leave the **Allow edits by maintainers** checkbox selected to ensure that the Adobe documentation team can make edits to the PR.

![create-pr](../assets/create-pr.png)

You can confirm that the pull request has been submitted by inspecting the pull requests tab in https://github.com/AdobeDocs/experience-platform.en.
