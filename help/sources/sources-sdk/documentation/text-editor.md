## Prerequisites

The following tutorial requires that you have GitHub Desktop installed on your local machine. If you do not have GitHub Desktop, you can download the application [here](https://desktop.github.com/).

## Connect to GitHub and set up your local authoring environment

The first step in setting up your local authoring environment is to navigate to the [Adobe Experience Platform GitHub repository](https://github.com/AdobeDocs/experience-platform.en).

Next, select **[!UICONTROL Fork]**.

To clone the repository to your local machine, select **[!UICONTROL Code]**. From the dropdown menu that appears, select **[!UICONTROL HTTPS]** and then, select **[!UICONTROL Open with GitHub Desktop]**.

Next, allow for a few moments for GitHub desktop to clone the experience-platform.en repository.

## Author the documentation page for your source

With the repository cloned to your local machine, you can now start authoring the documentation page for your new source through the [text editor of your choice](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/contributor/contributor-guide/setup/install-tools.html?lang=en#understand-markdown-editors).

Adobe recommends that you use [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and that you install the Adobe Markdown Authoring extension. To install the extension, launch Visual Studio Code, and select the **Extensions** tab from the left-navigation.
