# Document your source

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>Sources SDK is in beta. The feature and documentation are subject to change.

The final step before your new source can be set live in Adobe Experience Platform is to document your new source.

This documentation guide includes:

* A tutorial that you can follow to create a documentation page for your new source;
* A template for you to fill out for your new source;
* [Instructions on how to use Markdown for writing technical documentation](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/contributor/contributor-guide/writing-essentials/markdown.html?lang=en);
* [Instructions on understanding Adobe Markdown flavor](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/contributor/contributor-guide/writing-essentials/markdown.html?lang=en#custom-markdown-extensions).

## Prerequisites

The following items are required before you can start documenting your new source:

* **A valid GitHub user account**: If you do not have an existing GitHub account, then you must create one through the [GitHub sign up page](https://github.com/);
* **Access to GitHub Desktop**: You must use the [GitHub Desktop app](https://desktop.github.com/) in order to create your source documentation in your local environment;
* Your integration with Adobe must be in a testing phase with your source deployed in a staging environment in Adobe Experience Platform.
