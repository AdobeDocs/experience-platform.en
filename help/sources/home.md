# Source connectors overview

Adobe Experience Platform allows data to be ingested from external sources while providing you with the ability to structure, label, and enhance incoming data using Experience Platform services. You can ingest data from a variety of sources such as Adobe applications, cloud-based storages, databases, and many others.

[!DNL Flow Service] is used to collect and centralize customer data from various disparate sources within Experience Platform. The service provides a user interface and RESTful API that lets you set-up source connections to various data providers with ease. These source connections enable you to authenticate your third-party systems, set times for ingestion runs, and manage data ingestion throughput.

With Experience Platform, you can centralize data you collect from disparate sources and use the insights gained from it to do more.

## Adobe-built and partner-built sources {#adobe-and-partner-built-sources}

Some of the connectors in the Experience Platform sources catalog are built and maintained by Adobe, while others are built and maintained by partner companies by using [Sources SDK](/help/sources/sources-sdk/overview.md). A note at the top of the documentation page for each partner-built connector calls out if a source is created and maintained by the partner. For example, the [Amazon S3 connector](/help/sources/connectors/cloud-storage/s3.md) is created by Adobe, while the [RainFocus connector](/help/sources/connectors/analytics/rainfocus.md) is created and maintained by the RainFocus team. 

For partner-authored and maintained connectors, this means that issues with the connector might need to be resolved by the partner team (contact method provided in the note in the documentation page). For issues with Adobe-authored and maintained connectors, contact your Adobe representative or Customer Care.

## Access control for sources in data ingestion

Permissions for sources in data ingestion can be managed within the Adobe Admin Console. You can access permissions through the **[!UICONTROL Permissions]** tab in a particular product profile. From the **[!UICONTROL Edit Permissions]** panel, you can access the permissions pertaining to sources through the **[!UICONTROL data ingestion]** menu entry. The **[!UICONTROL View Sources]** permission grants read-only access to available sources in the **[!UICONTROL Catalog]** tab and authenticated sources in the **[!UICONTROL Browse]** tab, while the **[!UICONTROL Manage Sources]** permission grants full access to read, create, edit, and disable sources.

The following table outlines how the UI behaves based on different combinations of these permissions:

| Permission level | Description |
| ---- | ----|
| **[!UICONTROL View Sources]** On | Grant read-only access to sources in each source-type in the Catalog tab, as well as the Browse, Accounts, and Dataflow tabs. |
| **[!UICONTROL Manage Sources]** On | In addition to the functions included in **[!UICONTROL View Sources]**, grants access to **[!UICONTROL Connect Source]** option in **[!UICONTROL Catalog]** and to **[!UICONTROL Select Data]** option in **[!UICONTROL Browse]**. **[!UICONTROL Manage Sources]** also allows you to enable or disable **[!UICONTROL DataFlows]** and edit their schedules. |
| **[!UICONTROL View Sources]** Off and **[!UICONTROL Manage Sources]** Off | Revoke all access to sources. |

For more information about the available permissions granted through Adobe Permissions, read the [access control overview](../access-control/home.md).

### Attribute-based access control

Attribute-based access control in Adobe Experience Platform allows administrators to control access to specific objects and/or capabilities based on attributes. 

With attribute-based access control, you can apply mapping configurations to fields that you have permissions to. Furthermore, you cannot ingest data to a dataset if you do not have access to all fields in the dataset.

#### Support for attribute-based access control in sources

>[!TIP]
>
>Attribute-based access control works as follows: **roles** are created to categorize the types of users that interact with your Experience Platform instance. **Labels** are applied to **roles** to designate the access of that given role. **Labels** are also applied to resources like schema fields and segments. In order for a user to have access to certain schema fields and segments, they must be added to *a role with the same label that is assigned to the queried resource*. For more information, read the [attribute-based access control end-to-end guide](../access-control/abac/end-to-end-guide.md).

- Apply labels to schema fields to define access to specific schema fields in your organization. Once access to specific schema fields are established, users will only be able to create mappings for the fields that they have access to.
- Users without the appropriate roles will not be able to create or update dataflows with mappings that involve inaccessible schema fields. Furthermore, unauthorized users cannot update, delete, enable, or disable existing dataflows with inaccessible schema fields.
- Additionally, a dataflow must have the exact same schema ID and version in its mapping, target dataset, and target connection. This applies to both standard XDM schemas and model-based schemas.

>[!NOTE]
>
>Model-based schemas have additional requirements including primary key and version identifier fields. For more information, see the [model-based schema overview](../xdm/schema/model-based.md).

For more information on attribute-based access control, read the [attribute-based access control overview](../access-control/abac/overview.md).
