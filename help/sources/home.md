# Source connectors overview

Adobe Experience Platform allows data to be ingested from external sources while providing you with the ability to structure, label, and enhance incoming data using Platform services. You can ingest data from a variety of sources such as Adobe applications, cloud-based storages, databases, and many others.

[!DNL Flow Service] is used to collect and centralize customer data from various disparate sources within Platform. The service provides a user interface and RESTful API that lets you set-up source connections to various data providers with ease. These source connections enable you to authenticate your third-party systems, set times for ingestion runs, and manage data ingestion throughput.

With Experience Platform, you can centralize data you collect from disparate sources and use the insights gained from it to do more.

## Types of sources

Sources in Experience Platform are grouped into the following categories:

### Adobe applications

Experience Platform allows data to be ingested from other Adobe applications, including Adobe Analytics, Adobe Audience Manager, and [!DNL Experience Platform Launch]. See the following related documents for more information:

## Access control for sources in data ingestion

Permissions for sources in data ingestion can be managed within the Adobe Admin Console. You can access permissions through the **[!UICONTROL Permissions]** tab in a particular product profile. From the **[!UICONTROL Edit Permissions]** panel, you can access the permissions pertaining to sources through the **[!UICONTROL data ingestion]** menu entry. The **[!UICONTROL View Sources]** permission grants read-only access to available sources in the **[!UICONTROL Catalog]** tab and authenticated sources in the **[!UICONTROL Browse]** tab, while the **[!UICONTROL Manage Sources]** permission grants full access to read, create, edit, and disable sources.

The following table outlines how the UI behaves based on different combinations of these permissions:

| Permission level | Description |
| ---- | ----|
| **[!UICONTROL View Sources]** On | Grant read-only access to sources in each source-type in the Catalog tab, as well as the Browse, Accounts, and Dataflow tabs. |
| **[!UICONTROL Manage Sources]** On | In addition to the functions included in **[!UICONTROL View Sources]**, grants access to **[!UICONTROL Connect Source]** option in **[!UICONTROL Catalog]** and to **[!UICONTROL Select Data]** option in **[!UICONTROL Browse]**. **[!UICONTROL Manage Sources]** also allows you to enable or disable **[!UICONTROL DataFlows]** and edit their schedules. |
| **[!UICONTROL View Sources]** Off and **[!UICONTROL Manage Sources]** Off | Revoke all access to sources. |

For more information about the available permissions granted through the Admin Console, including those four sources, see the [access control overview](../access-control/home.md).
