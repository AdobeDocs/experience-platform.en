# Templates 

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>Templates are in Alpha and is currently only supported by the [[!DNL Marketo Engage] source](./connectors/adobe-applications/marketo/marketo.md). The documentation and functionalities are subject to change.

Adobe Experience Platform provides pre-configured templates that you can use to accelerate your data ingestion process. Templates include auto-generated assets such as schemas, datasets, mapping rules, identity namespaces, and dataflows that you can use when bringing in data from a source to Experience Platform.

With templates, you can:

* Reduce time-to-value of ingestion through acceleration of ML-based asset creation.
* Minimize errors that can occur during the manual data ingestion process.
