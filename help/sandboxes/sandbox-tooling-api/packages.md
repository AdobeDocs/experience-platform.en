# Packages endpoint

Sandbox tooling allows you to select different artifacts (also known as objects) and export them into a package. A package can consist of a single artifact or multiple artifacts (such as datasets or schemas). Any artifacts that are included in a package must be from the same sandbox. 

The `/packages` endpoint in the sandbox tooling API allows you to programmatically manage packages in your organization, including publishing a package and importing a package to a sandbox.

## Create a package {#create}

You can create a multi-artifact package, by making a POST request to the `/packages` endpoint while providing values for your package's name and package type.

**API format**

```http
POST /packages/
```

**Request**

```shell
curl -X POST \
  https://platform.adobe.io/data/foundation/exim/packages \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer {ACCESS_TOKEN}' \

## Import a package {#import}

This endpoint is used to fetch the conflicting objects in the specified target sandbox. Conflicting objects represent similar objects that are already present in the target sandbox. 

**API format**

```http
GET /packages/{PACKAGE_ID}/import?targetSandbox=targetSandboxName
```

| Parameter | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `{PACKAGE_ID}` | The ID of the package you want to look up. |

**Request**

The following request imports the {PACKAGE_ID}.

```shell
curl -X GET \
  https://platform.adobe.io/data/foundation/exim/packages/{PACKAGE_ID}/import?targetSandbox=targetSandboxName \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer {ACCESS_TOKEN}' \
  -H 'x-api-key: {API_KEY}' \
  -H 'x-gw-ims-org-id: {ORG_ID}' \
  -H 'x-sandbox-name: {SANDBOX_NAME}' \
```

**Response**

Conflicts are returned in the response. The response shows the original package plus the `alternatives` fragment as an array ordered by ranking.

## Submit an import {#submit-import}

>[!NOTE]
>
>It is inherent with conflict resolution that the alternative artifact already exists in the target sandbox.

You can submit an import for a package once you have reviewed conflicts and provided substitutions by making a POST request to the `/packages` endpoint. The result is provided as a payload, which starts the import job for the destination sandbox as specified in the payload.

Payload also accept user specified job name and description for import job. If user specified name and description is not available, then package name and description is used for job name and description.

**API format**

```http
POST /packages/import
```

**Request**

The following request retrieves packages to be imported. The payload is a map of substitutions where, if an entry exists, the key is the `artifactId` provided by the package, and the alternative is the value. If the map or payload is **empty**, no substitutions are performed.

```shell
curl -X POST \
  https://platform.adobe.io/data/foundation/exim/packages/import/ \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer {ACCESS_TOKEN}' \
  -H 'x-api-key: {API_KEY}' \
  -H 'x-gw-ims-org-id: {ORG_ID}' \
  -H 'x-sandbox-name: {SANDBOX_NAME}' \
  -d'{

         "imsOrgId": "5C1328435BF324E90A49402A@AdobeOrg"
     },
     "alternatives": {

         "type": "REGISTRY_SCHEMA"
       }
     }
  }'
```

| Property | Description | Type | Mandatory |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `alternatives` | `alternatives` represent the mapping of source sandbox artifacts to the existing target sandbox artifacts. Because they are already there, the import job avoids creating these artifacts in the target sandbox. | String | No |
