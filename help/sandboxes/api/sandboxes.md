# Sandbox management endpoint

Sandboxes in Adobe Experience Platform provide isolated development environments that allow you to test features, run experiments, and make custom configurations without impacting your production environment. The `/sandboxes` endpoint in the [!DNL Sandbox] API allows you to programmatically manage sandboxes in Platform.

## Getting started

The API endpoint used in this guide is part of the [[!DNL Sandbox] API](https://www.adobe.io/experience-platform-apis/references/sandbox). Before continuing, please review the [getting started guide](./getting-started.md) for links to related documentation, a guide to reading the sample API calls in this document, and important information regarding required headers that are needed to successfully make calls to any Experience Platform API.

## Retrieve a list of sandboxes {#list}

You can list all sandboxes belonging to your organization (active or otherwise), by making a GET request to the `/sandboxes` endpoint.

**API format**

```http
GET /sandboxes?{QUERY_PARAMS}
```

| Parameter | Description |
| --------- | ----------- |
| `{QUERY_PARAMS}` | Optional query parameters to filter results by. See the section on [query parameters](./appendix.md#query) for more information. |

**Request**

```shell
curl -X GET \
  https://platform.adobe.io/data/foundation/sandbox-management/sandboxes?&limit=4&offset=1 \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer {ACCESS_TOKEN}' \

>When a new sandbox is created, you must first add that new sandbox to your product profile in [Adobe Admin Console](https://adminconsole.adobe.com/) before you can start using the new sandbox. See the documentation on [managing permissions for a product profile](../../access-control/ui/permissions.md) for information on how to provision a sandbox to a product profile.

You can create a new development or production sandbox by making a POST request to the `/sandboxes` endpoint.

### Create a development sandbox

To create a development sandbox, you must provide a `type` attribute with a value of `development` in the request payload.

**API format**

```http
POST /sandboxes
```

**Request**

The following request creates a new development sandbox named "acme-dev".

```shell
curl -X POST \
  https://platform.adobe.io/data/foundation/sandbox-management/sandboxes \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer {ACCESS_TOKEN}' \
  -H 'x-api-key: {API_KEY}' \
  -H 'x-gw-ims-org-id: {ORG_ID}' \

A successful response returns the details of the updated sandbox, showing that its `state` is "resetting".

```json
{
    "id": "d8184350-dbf5-11e9-875f-6bf1873fec16",
    "name": "acme-dev",
    "title": "Acme Business Group dev",
    "state": "resetting",
    "type": "development",
    "region": "VA7"
}
```

The default production sandbox and any user-created production sandboxes cannot be reset if the identity graph hosted within it is also being used by Adobe Analytics for the [Cross Device Analytics (CDA)](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/analytics/components/cda/overview.html) feature, or if the identity graph hosted within it is also being used by Adobe Audience Manager for the [People Based Destinations (PBD)](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/audience-manager/user-guide/features/destinations/people-based/people-based-destinations-overview.html) feature.

The following is a list of possible exceptions that could prevent a sandbox from being reset:

```json
{
    "status": 400,
    "title": "Sandbox `{SANDBOX_NAME}` cannot be reset. The identity graph hosted in this sandbox is also being used by Adobe Analytics for the Cross Device Analytics (CDA) feature.",
    "type": "http://ns.adobe.com/aep/errors/SMS-2074-400"
},
{
    "status": 400,
    "title": "Sandbox `{SANDBOX_NAME}` cannot be reset. The identity graph hosted in this sandbox is also being used by Adobe Audience Manager for the People Based Destinations (PBD) feature.",
    "type": "http://ns.adobe.com/aep/errors/SMS-2075-400"
},
{
    "status": 400,
    "title": "Sandbox `{SANDBOX_NAME}` cannot be reset. The identity graph hosted in this sandbox is also being used by Adobe Audience Manager for the People Based Destinations (PBD) feature, as well by Adobe Analytics for the Cross Device Analytics (CDA) feature.",
    "type": "http://ns.adobe.com/aep/errors/SMS-2076-400"
},
{
    "status": 400,
    "title": "Warning: Sandbox `{SANDBOX_NAME}` is used for bi-directional segment sharing with Adobe Audience Manager or Audience Core Service.",
    "type": "http://ns.adobe.com/aep/errors/SMS-2077-400"
}
```

You can proceed to reset a production sandbox that is used for bi-directional segment sharing with [!DNL Audience Manager] or [!DNL Audience Core Service] by adding the `ignoreWarnings` parameter to your request.

**API format**

```http
PUT /sandboxes/{SANDBOX_NAME}?ignoreWarnings=true
```

| Parameter | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `{SANDBOX_NAME}` | The `name` property of the sandbox you want to reset. |
| `ignoreWarnings` | An optional parameter that allows you to  skip the validation check and force the reset of a production sandbox that is used for bi-directional segment sharing with [!DNL Audience Manager] or [!DNL Audience Core Service]. This parameter cannot be applied to a default production sandbox. |

**Request**

The following request resets a production sandbox named "acme".

```shell
curl -X PUT \
  https://platform.adobe.io/data/foundation/sandbox-management/sandboxes/acme?ignoreWarnings=true \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer {ACCESS_TOKEN}' \
  -H 'x-api-key: {API_KEY}' \
  -H 'x-gw-ims-org-id: {ORG_ID}' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json'
  -d '{
    "action": "reset"
  }'
```

**Response**

A successful response returns the details of the updated sandbox, showing that its `state` is "resetting".

```json
{
    "id": "d8184350-dbf5-11e9-875f-6bf1873fec16",
    "name": "acme",
    "title": "Acme Business Group prod",
    "state": "resetting",
    "type": "production",
    "region": "VA7"
}
```

## Delete a sandbox {#delete}

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>The default production sandbox cannot be deleted.

You can delete a sandbox by making a DELETE request that includes the sandbox's `name` in the request path.

>[!NOTE]
>
>Making this API call updates the sandbox's `status` property to "deleted" and deactivates it. GET requests can still retrieve sandbox's details after it has been deleted.

**API format**

```http
DELETE /sandboxes/{SANDBOX_NAME}
```

| Parameter | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `{SANDBOX_NAME}` | The `name` of the sandbox you want to delete. |
| `validationOnly` | An optional parameter that allows you to do a pre-flight check on the sandbox delete operation without making the actual request. Set this parameter to `validationOnly=true` to check if the sandbox you are about to reset contains any Adobe Analytics, Adobe Audience Manager, or segment sharing data. |
| `ignoreWarnings` | An optional parameter that allows you to skip the validation check and force the deletion of a user-created production sandbox that is used for bi-directional segment sharing with [!DNL Audience Manager] or [!DNL Audience Core Service]. This parameter cannot be applied to a default production sandbox. |

**Request**

The following request deletes a production sandbox named "acme".

```shell
curl -X DELETE \
  https://platform.adobe.io/data/foundation/sandbox-management/sandboxes/acme?ignoreWarnings=true \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer {ACCESS_TOKEN}' \
  -H 'x-api-key: {API_KEY}' \
  -H 'x-gw-ims-org-id: {ORG_ID}'
```

**Response**

A successful response returns the sandbox's updated details, showing that its `state` is "deleted".

```json
{
    "name": "acme",
    "title": "Acme Business Group prod",
    "state": "deleted",
    "type": "development",
    "region": "VA7"
}
```
