# Sandbox UI overview

Adobe Experience Platform provides virtual sandboxes that partition a single Platform instance into separate, isolated  virtual environments. The Sandbox user interface can be found within the [Experience Platform UI](https://platform.adobe.com). 

Once you have logged in to the Experience Platform UI, please proceed to the [sandbox user guide](user-guide.md) for steps on how to perform various tasks in the sandbox workspace.

For steps on performing different operations using the Sandbox API, see the [sandbox developer guide](../api/getting-started.md). For a high-level overview of sandboxes in Experience Platform, please refer to the [overview documentation](../home.md).
