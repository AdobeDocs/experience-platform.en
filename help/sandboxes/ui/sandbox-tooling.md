# Sandbox tooling

>[!NOTE]
>
>Sandbox tooling is a foundational capability that supports both [!DNL Real-Time Customer Data Platform] and [!DNL Journey Optimizer] to improve the development cycle efficiency and configuration accuracy.<br><br>You are required to have the following two role-based access control permissions to use the sandbox tooling feature:<br>- `manage-sandbox` or `view-sandbox`<br>- `manage-package`

Improve configuration accuracy across sandboxes and seamlessly export and import sandbox configurations between sandboxes with the sandbox tooling feature. Use sandbox tooling to reduce the time to value for the implementation process and move successful configurations across sandboxes.

You can use the sandbox tooling feature to select different objects and export them into a package. A package can consist of a single object or multiple objects. <!--or an entire sandbox.-->Any objects that are included in a package must be from the same sandbox.

## Objects supported for sandbox tooling {#supported-objects}

The sandbox tooling feature provides you with the ability to export [!DNL Adobe Real-Time Customer Data Platform] and [!DNL Adobe Journey Optimizer] objects into a package. 

### Real-time Customer Data Platform objects {#real-time-cdp-objects}

The table below lists [!DNL Adobe Real-Time Customer Data Platform] objects that are currently supported for sandbox tooling:

| Platform | Object | Details |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Customer Data Platform | Sources | The source account credentials are not replicated in the target sandbox for security reasons and will be required to be updated manually. The source dataflow is copied in a draft status by default. |
| Customer Data Platform | Audiences | Only the **[!UICONTROL Customer Audience]** type **[!UICONTROL Segmentation service]** is supported. Existing labels for consent and governance will be copied over in the same import job. System will auto select default Merge Policy in target sandbox with same XDM class when checking merge policy dependencies. |
| Customer Data Platform | Identities | The system will auto-deduplicate Adobe standard identity namespaces when creating in the target sandbox. Audiences can only be copied when all attributes in audience rules are enabled in the union schema. The necessary schemas must be moved and enabled for unified profile first. |
| Customer Data Platform | Schemas | Existing labels for consent and governance will be copied over in the same import job. User has the flexibility to import schemas without Unified Profile option enabled. The schema relationships edge case are not included in the package. |
| Customer Data Platform | Datasets | Datasets are copied with the unified profile setting disabled by default. |
| Customer Data Platform | Consent and Governance Policies | Add custom policies created by a user to a package and move them across sandboxes. |

The following objects are imported but are in a draft or disabled status:

| Feature | Object | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Import status | Source dataflow | Draft |
| Import status |  Journey | Draft |
| Unified profile | Dataset | Unified profile disabled |
| Policies | Data governance policies | Disabled |

### Adobe Journey Optimizer objects {#abobe-journey-optimizer-objects}

The table below lists [!DNL Adobe Journey Optimizer] objects that are currently supported for sandbox tooling and limitations:

| Platform | Object | Details |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [!DNL Adobe Journey Optimizer] | Audience | An audience can be copied as a dependent object of the journey object. You can select create a new audience or reuse an existing one in the target sandbox. |
| [!DNL Adobe Journey Optimizer] | Schema | The schemas used in the journey can be copied as dependent objects. You can select create a new schema or reuse an existing one in the target sandbox. |
| [!DNL Adobe Journey Optimizer] | Merge policy | The merge policies used in the journey can be copied as dependent objects. In the target sandbox, you **cannot** create a new merge policy, you can only utilize an already existing one. |
| [!DNL Adobe Journey Optimizer] | Journey - canvas details | The representation of the journey on the canvas includes the objects in the journey, such as conditions, actions, events, read audiences, and so on, which are copied. The jump activity is excluded from the copy. |
| [!DNL Adobe Journey Optimizer] | Event | The events and event details used in the journey are copied. It will always create a new version in theÂ target sandbox. |
| [!DNL Adobe Journey Optimizer] | Action | Email and push messages used in the journey can be copied as dependent objects. The channel action activities used in the journey fields, which are used for personalization in the message, are not checked for completeness. Content blocks are not copied.<br><br>The update profile action used in the journey can be copied. Custom actions and action details used in the journey are also copied. It will always create a new version in the target sandbox.|

Surfaces (for example, presets) are not copied over. The system automatically selects the closest possible match on the destination sandbox based on the message type and surface name. If there are no surfaces found on the target sandbox, then the surface copy will fail, causing the message copy to fail because a message requires a surface to be available for setup. In this case, at least one surface needs to be created for the right channel of the message in order for the copy to work.

Custom identity types are not supported as dependent objects when exporting a journey.
