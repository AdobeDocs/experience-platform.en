# Share packages across organizations using Sandbox Tooling

>[!NOTE]
>
>Sharing packages across organizations is currently in beta and only available to select beta customers.

Improve configuration accuracy across sandboxes and seamlessly export and import sandbox configurations between sandboxes across different organizations with the sandbox tooling feature. This document covers how to use sandbox tooling in Adobe Experience Platform to share packages across different organizations. There are two types of shared packages:

- **Private package**

[Private packages](#private-packages) can only be shared with organizations that have approved the sharing request from the source organization via an opt-in allow list.

- **Public package**

[Public packages](#public-packages) are available to import without any additional approval.Â These packages can be shared on a partner's website, blog, or platform. The package payload allows packages to be copied and pasted from these channels to the target organization.

## Private packages {#private-packages}

>[!NOTE]
>
>To initiate and approve a sharing request and share packages across organizations, you will need to have **package-share** role-based access control permission.

Use the Sandbox Tooling feature to create partnerships, track partnership request stats, manage existing partnerships, and share packages with partner organizations.

### Create an organization partnership request

To create an organization partnership request, navigate to the **[!UICONTROL Sandboxes]** **[!UICONTROL Partner orgs]** tab. Next, select **[!UICONTROL Manage partner orgs]**.

![The sandboxes UI, with the Partner orgs tab and Manage partner orgs highlighted.](../images/ui/sandbox-tooling/private-manage-partner-orgs.png)

In the [!UICONTROL Package partner management] dialog, enter the organization ID into **[!UICONTROL Enter Org ID]** and press enter (Windows) or return (Mac). The organization ID is shown in the **[!UICONTROL Selected Org IDs]** section below. After adding the IDs, select **[!UICONTROL Confirm]**.

>[!TIP]
>
>Multiple organization IDs can be entered at a time using comma-separated lists or by entering each organization ID followed by enter.

![The Package Partner orgs dialog with Enter Org ID, Selected Org IDs, and Confirm highlighted.](../images/ui/sandbox-tooling/private-enter-org-id.png)

The sharing request is successfully sent to the partner organization, and you are returned to the [!UICONTROL Sandboxes] **[!UICONTROL Partner orgs]** tab, which displays the **[!UICONTROL Outgoing request]**.

### Authorize a partnership request {#authorize-request}

To authorize an organization partnership request, navigate to the [!UICONTROL Sandboxes] **[!UICONTROL Partner orgs]** tab. Next, select **[!UICONTROL Incoming request]**.

![The sandboxes UI with the Partner orgs tab and Incoming request highlighted.](../images/ui/sandbox-tooling/private-authorise-partner-org.png)

The current **[!UICONTROL Status]** for the request, at this stage, is **Pending**. To approve the request, select the ellipsis (`...`) next to the selected request, then select **[!UICONTROL Approve]** from the dropdown.

## Public packages {#public-packages}

Use the Sandbox Tooling feature to create shareable public packages that don't require any additional approval and are easily imported with the use of the package's payload.

### Update package visibility to public {#update-package}

To update a package's visibility type, navigate to the [!UICONTROL Sandboxes] **[!UICONTROL Packages]** tab. Next, select the ellipsis (`...`) next to the package, and then select **[!UICONTROL Update to public package]** from the dropdown menu.

![The Sandboxes UI with the packages tab and the dropdown option menu with Update to public package highlighted.](../images/ui/sandbox-tooling/update-to-public.png)

In the **[!UICONTROL Change package visibility to public]** dialog, verify the package name is correct and select **[!UICONTROL Confirm]**. 

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
> Once a package has been made public, it cannot be changed back to private.
