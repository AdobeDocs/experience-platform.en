# Calculated fields

Calculated fields allow for values to be created based on the attributes in the input schema. These values can then be assigned to attributes in the target schema and be provided a name and description to allow for easier reference.

To create a calculated field, select **[!UICONTROL Add calculated field]**.

The **[!UICONTROL Create calculated field]** panel appears. The left dialog box contains the fields, functions, and operators supported in calculated fields. Select one of the tabs to start adding functions, fields, or operators to the expression editor.

You can manually add fields, functions, and operators using the expression editor at the center. Select the editor to start creating an expression.
