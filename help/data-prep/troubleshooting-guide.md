# [!DNL Data Prep] troubleshooting guide

This document provides answers to frequently asked questions about Adobe Experience Platform [!DNL Data Prep], as well as a troubleshooting guide for common errors. For questions and troubleshooting information regarding Platform APIs in general, see the [Adobe Experience Platform API troubleshooting guide](../landing/troubleshooting.md).

## FAQ

The following is a list of frequently asked questions about [!DNL Data Prep] and their answers.

### How are transformation errors resolved?

[!DNL Data Prep] localizes all transformation errors to the column in which they occurred. As a result, that column is nullified and the rest of the row will continue to be processed. These transformation issues are logged as **Warnings**. It is recommended that you review the warnings periodically and adjust the transformation logic to account for the transformation issues. This will increase the quality of the data ingested into Experience Platform. 

If the columns marked as **Required** are nullified due to transformation issues, then the row will not be ingested. When partial data ingestion is enabled, you can set the threshold of such rejections before the entire flow fails.. If the nullified attribute did not impact any schema level validations, the row will continue to be ingested. 

Any rows that are invalid even without any transformation errors, will also be rejected. For example, a data ingestion flow may have a pass through mapping (no transformation logic) to a required field and there is no incoming value for that attribute. This row will be rejected.

### How can I escape special characters in a field?

You can escape special characters in a field by using `${...}`. However, JSON files that contain fields with a period (`.`) is not supported by this mechanism. When interacting with hierarchies, if a child attribute has a period (`.`), you must use a backslash (`\`) to escape special characters. For example, `address` is an object that contains the attribute `street.name`, this can then be referred to as `address.street\.name` instead of `address.street.name`.
