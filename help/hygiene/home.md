# Data hygiene on Adobe Experience Platform

Adobe Experience Platform provides a robust set of tools to manage large, complicated data operations in order to orchestrate customer experiences. As data is ingested into the system over time, it becomes increasingly important to manage your data stores so that data is used as expected, is updated when incorrect data needs correcting, and is deleted when organizational policies deem it necessary.

Platform's data hygiene capabilities allow you manage your stored customer data through programmatic updates and deletions. The [!UICONTROL Data Hygiene] workspace in the Platform UI allows you to configure and schedule data hygiene operations and verify that your records are being maintained as expected.
