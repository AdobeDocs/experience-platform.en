# Data hygiene on Adobe Experience Platform

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>Data hygiene capabilities in Adobe Experience Platform are currently only available for organizations that have purchased Adobe Shield for Healthcare.

Adobe Experience Platform provides a robust set of tools to manage large, complicated data operations in order to orchestrate consumer experiences. As data is ingested into the system over time, it becomes increasingly important to manage your data stores so that data is used as expected, is updated when incorrect data needs correcting, and is deleted when organizational policies deem it necessary.

Platform's data hygiene capabilities allow you manage your stored consumer data through programmatic deletions of consumer records and datasets. 

## [!UICONTROL Data Hygiene] UI workspace

The [!UICONTROL Data Hygiene] workspace in the Platform UI allows you to configure and schedule data hygiene operations and verify that your records are being maintained as expected.

For detailed steps on managing data hygiene tasks in the UI, see the [Data Hygiene UI guide](./ui/overview.md).

## Data Hygiene API

The [!UICONTROL Data Hygiene] UI is built on top of the Data Hygiene API, whose endpoints are available for you to use directly if you prefer to automate your data hygiene activities. See the [Data Hygiene API guide](./api/overview.md) for more information.
