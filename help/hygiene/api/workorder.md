# Record delete work orders {#work-order-endpoint}

Use the `/workorder` endpoint in the Data Hygiene API to manage record delete work orders in Adobe Experience Platform. Use work orders to control, monitor, and track the removal of data from Experience Platform. Work orders help you maintain data quality and support your organization's data governance standards.

>[!IMPORTANT] 
>
>Record delete work orders are for data cleansing, removing anonymous data, or data minimization. **Do not use record delete work orders for data subject rights requests under privacy regulations such as GDPR.** For compliance use cases, use [Adobe Experience Platform Privacy Service](../../privacy-service/home.md).

## Getting started

Review the [overview](./overview.md) before continuing. The overview provides related documentation links, a guide to reading sample API calls, and important information about required headers for making calls to Experience Platform APIs.

## Quotas and processing timelines {#quotas}

Record delete work orders are subject to daily and monthly identifier submission limits, determined by your organization's license entitlement. These limits apply to both UI- and API-based record delete requests.

>[!NOTE]
>
>You can submit up to **1,000,000 identifiers per day**, but only if your remaining monthly quota allows it. If your monthly cap is less than 1 million, your daily submissions cannot exceed that cap.

### Monthly submission entitlement by product {#quota-limits}

The following table shows identifier submission limits by product and entitlement level. For each product, the monthly cap is the lesser of two values: a fixed identifier ceiling or a percentage-based threshold tied to your licensed data volume.

| Product  | Entitlement Description | Monthly Cap (Whichever is Less) |
|----------|-------------------------|---------------------------------|
| Real-Time CDP or Adobe Journey Optimizer | Without Privacy and Security Shield or Healthcare Shield add-on          | 2,000,000 identifiers or 5% of addressable audience                    |
| Real-Time CDP or Adobe Journey Optimizer | With Privacy and Security Shield or Healthcare Shield add-on             | 15,000,000 identifiers or 10% of addressable audience                  |
| Customer Journey Analytics               | Without Privacy and Security Shield or Healthcare Shield add-on          | 2,000,000 identifiers or 100 identifiers per million CJA rows of entitlement |
| Customer Journey Analytics               | With Privacy and Security Shield or Healthcare Shield add-on             | 15,000,000 identifiers or 200 identifiers per million CJA rows of entitlement |

>[!NOTE]
>
>Most organizations will have lower monthly limits based on their actual addressable audience or CJA row entitlements.

>[!NOTE]
>
>Quotas reset on the first day of each calendar month. Unused quota does **not** carry over.

>[!NOTE]
>
>Quotas are based on your organization's licensed monthly entitlement for **submitted identifiers**. These are not enforced by system guardrails but may be monitored and reviewed.  
>Record delete work order capacity is a **shared service**. Your monthly cap reflects the highest entitlement across Real-Time CDP, Adobe Journey Optimizer, Customer Journey Analytics, and any applicable Shield add-ons.

### Processing timelines for identifier submissions {#sla-processing-timelines}

After submission, record delete work orders are queued and processed based on your entitlement level.

| Product & Entitlement Description  | Queue Duration      | Maximum Processing Time (SLA) |
|------------------------------------|---------------------|-------------------------------|
| Without Privacy and Security Shield or Healthcare Shield add-on                   | Up to 15 days       | 30 days                       |
| With Privacy and Security Shield or Healthcare Shield add-on                      | Typically 24 hours  | 15 days                       |

If your organization requires higher limits, contact your Adobe representative for an entitlement review.

>[!TIP]
>
>To check your current quota usage or entitlement tier, see the [Quota reference guide](../api/quota.md).

## List record delete work orders {#list}

Retrieve a paginated list of record delete work orders for data hygiene operations in your organization. Filter results using query parameters. Each work order record includes action type, status, related dataset and user information, and audit metadata.

## Create a record delete work order {#create}

To delete records associated with one or more identities from a single dataset or all datasets, make a POST request to the `/workorder` endpoint.

Work orders are processed asynchronously and appear in the work order list after submission.

>[!TIP]
>
>Each record delete work order submitted through the API can include up to **100,000 identities**. Submit as many identities per request as possible to maximize efficiency. Avoid low-volume submissions such as single-ID work orders.

**API format**

```http
POST /workorder
```

>[!NOTE]
>
>You can only delete records from datasets that have a primary identity or an identity map defined in their associated XDM schema.

**Request**

The following request deletes all records associated with specified email addresses from a particular dataset.

```shell
curl -X POST \
  https://platform.adobe.io/data/core/hygiene/workorder \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer {ACCESS_TOKEN}' \
  -H 'x-api-key: {API_KEY}' \
  -H 'x-gw-ims-org-id: {ORG_ID}' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H 'x-sandbox-name: {SANDBOX_NAME}' \
  -d '{
        "displayName": "Acme Loyalty - Customer Data Deletion",
        "description": "Delete all records associated with the specified email addresses from the Acme_Loyalty_2023 dataset.",
        "action": "delete-identity",
        "datasetId": "7eab61f3e5c34810a49a1ab3",
        "namespacesIdentities": [
          {
            "namespace": {
              "code": "email"
            },
            "IDs": [
              "alice.smith@acmecorp.com",
              "bob.jones@acmecorp.com",
              "charlie.brown@acmecorp.com"
            ]
          }
        ]
      }'
```

The following table describes the properties for creating a record delete work order.

| Property | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `displayName`          | A human-readable label for this record delete work order. |
| `description`          | A description of the record delete work order. |
| `action`               | The action requested for the record delete work order. To delete records associated with a given identity, use `delete-identity`. |
| `datasetId`            | The unique identifier for the dataset. Use the dataset ID for a specific dataset, or `ALL` to target all datasets. Datasets must have a primary identity or identity map. If an identity map exists, it will be present as a top-level field named `identityMap`.<br>Note that a dataset row may have many identities in its identity map, but only one can be marked as primary. `"primary": true` must be included to force the `id` to match a primary identity. |
| `namespacesIdentities` | An array of objects, each containing:<br><ul><li> `namespace`: An object with a `code` property specifying the identity namespace (e.g., "email").</li><li> `IDs`: An array of identity values to delete for this namespace.</li></ul>Identity namespaces provide context to identity data. You can create and manage custom namespaces or use standard namespaces provided by Experience Platform. See the [identity namespace documentation](../../identity-service/features/namespaces.md) or the [Identity Service API specification](https://developer.adobe.com/experience-platform-apis/references/identity-service/#operation/getIdNamespaces) to learn more. |
