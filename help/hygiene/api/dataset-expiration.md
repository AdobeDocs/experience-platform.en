# Dataset expiration endpoint

The `/ttl` endpoint in the Data Hygiene API allows you to schedule expiration dates for datasets in Adobe Experience Platform.

A dataset expiration is only a timed-delayed delete operation. The dataset is not protected in the interim, so it may be be deleted by other means before its expiry is reached.

>[!NOTE]
>
>Although the expiry is specified as a specific instant in time, there may be up to 24 hours of delay after the expiry before the actual deletion is initiated. Once the delete is initiated, it can take up to seven days before all traces of the dataset have been removed from Platform systems.

At any time before the dataset-delete is actually initiated, you can cancel the expiration or modify its trigger time. After cancelling a dataset expiration, you can reopen it by setting a new expiry.

Once the dataset deletion is initiated, its expiration job will be marked as `executing`, and it may not be further altered. The dataset itself may be recoverable for up to seven days, but only through a manual process initiated through an Adobe service request. As the request executes, the data lake, Identity Service, and Real-Time Customer Profile begin separate processes to remove the dataset's contents from their respective services. Once the data is deleted from all three services, the expiration is marked as `executed`.

>[!WARNING]
>
>If a dataset is set to expire, you must manually change any dataflows that may be ingesting data into that dataset so that your downstream workflows are not negatively affected.

## Getting started

The endpoint used in this guide is part of the Data Hygiene API. Before continuing, please review the [overview](./overview.md) for links to related documentation, a guide to reading the sample API calls in this document, and important information regarding required headers that are needed to successfully make calls to any Experience Platform API.

## List dataset expirations {#list}

You can list all dataset expirations for your organization by making a GET request.

**API format**

```http
GET /ttl?{QUERY_PARAMETERS}
```

| Parameter | Description |

### Catalog expiry tags

When using the [Catalog API](../../catalog/api/getting-started.md) to look up dataset details, if the dataset has an active expiration it will be listed under `tags.adobe/hygiene/ttl`.

The following JSON represents a truncated response for a dataset's details from Catalog, which an expiration value of `32503680000000`. The tag's value  encodes the expiry as an integer number of milliseconds since the beginning of the Unix epoch.

```json
{
  "63212313c308d51b997858ba": {
    "name": "Test Dataset",
    "description": "A piecrust promise, made to be broken",
    "imsOrg": "0FCC747E56F59C747F000101@AdobeOrg",
    "sandboxId": "8dc51b90-d0f9-11e9-b164-ed6a398c8b35",
    "tags": {

## Retrieve the expiration status history of a dataset

You can look up the expiration status history of a specific dataset by using the query parameter `include=history` in a lookup request. The result includes information about about the creation of the dataset expiration, any updates that have been applied, and its cancellation or execution (if applicable).

**API format**

```http
GET /ttl/{DATASET_ID}?include=history

## Appendix

### Accepted query parameters {#query-params}

The following table outlines the available query parameters when [listing dataset expirations](#list):

| Parameter | Description | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `size` | An integer between 1 and 100 that indicates the maximum number of expirations to return. Defaults to 25. | `size=50` |
| `page` | An integer that indicates which page of expirations to return. | `page=3` |
| `orgId` | Matches datasets expirations whose organization ID matches that of the parameter. This value defaults to that of the `x-gw-ims-org-id` headers, and is ignored unless the request supplies a service token. | `orgId=885737B25DC460C50A49411B@AdobeOrg` |
| `status` | A comma-separated list of statuses. When included, the response matches dataset expirations whose current status is among those listed. | `status=pending,cancelled` |
| `author` | Matches expirations whose `created_by` is a match for the search string. If the search string begins with `LIKE` or `NOT LIKE`, the remainder is treated as an SQL search pattern. Otherwise, the entire search string is treated as a literal string that must exactly match the entire content of a `created_by` field. | `author=LIKE %john%` |
| `sandboxName` | Matches dataset expirations whose sandbox name exactly matches the argument. Defaults to the sandbox name in the request's `x-sandbox-name` header. Use `sandboxName=*` to include dataset expirations from all sandboxes. | `sandboxName=dev1` |
| `datasetId` | Matches expirations that apply to specific dataset. | `datasetId=62b3925ff20f8e1b990a7434` |
| `createdDate` | Matches expirations that were created in the 24-hour window starting at the stated time.<br><br>Note that dates without a time (like `2021-12-07`) represent the datetime at the beginning of that day. Thus, `createdDate=2021-12-07` refers to any expiration created on 7 December 2021, from `00:00:00` through `23:59:59.999999999` (UTC). | `createdDate=2021-12-07` |
| `createdFromDate` | Matches expirations that were created at, or after, the indicated time. | `createdFromDate=2021-12-07T00:00:00Z` |
| `createdToDate` | Matches expirations that were created at, or before, the indicated time. | `createdToDate=2021-12-07T23:59:59.999999999Z` |
| `updatedDate` / `updatedToDate` / `updatedFromDate` | Like `createdDate` / `createdFromDate` / `createdToDate`, but matches against a dataset expiration's update time instead of creation time.<br><br>An expiration is considered updated on every edit, including when it is created, cancelled, or executed. | `updatedDate=2022-01-01` |
| `cancelledDate` / `cancelledToDate` / `cancelledFromDate` | Matches expirations that were cancelled at any time in the indicated interval. This applies even if the expiration was later reopened (by setting a new expiry for the same dataset). | `updatedDate=2022-01-01` |
| `completedDate` / `completedToDate` / `completedFromDate` | Matches expirations that were completed during the specified interval. | `completedToDate=2021-11-11-06:00` |
| `expiryDate` / `expiryToDate` / `expiryFromDate` | Matches expirations that are due to be executed, or have already been executed, during the specified interval. | `expiryFromDate=2099-01-01&expiryToDate=2100-01-01` |
