# Data hygiene UI guide

The **[!UICONTROL Data cleansing]** workspace in the Adobe Experience Platform UI allows you to create and monitor various data hygiene tasks, including deleting customer identities and scheduling time-to-live (TTL) protocols for datasets.

This guide covers how to manage data hygiene tasks in the Platform UI. For information on how to perform these tasks using API calls, see the [Data Hygiene API guide](./api/overview.md).

## Browse existing hygiene tasks

Select **[!UICONTROL Data cleansing]** in the left navigation to access the workspace, showing a list of previously created hygiene tasks and their details.

Select **[!UICONTROL Consumer]** to view a list of identity deletion requests, and **[!UICONTROL Dataset]** to view a list of time-to-live (TTL) schedules for datasets.
