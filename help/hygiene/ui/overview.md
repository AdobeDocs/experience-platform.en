The **[!UICONTROL Data Lifecycle]** workspace in the Adobe Experience Platform UI allows you to create and monitor various data lifecycle management tasks, including deleting records and scheduling dataset expirations.

This guide covers how to manage data lifecycle tasks in the Platform UI. For information on how to perform these tasks using API calls, see the [Data Hygiene API guide](../api/overview.md).

To access the workspace, select **Data Lifecycle** in the left navigation.
