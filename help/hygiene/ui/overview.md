# Data hygiene UI guide

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>Data hygiene capabilities in Adobe Experience Platform are currently only available for organizations that have purchased Healthcare Shield.

The **[!UICONTROL Data Hygiene]** workspace in the Adobe Experience Platform UI allows you to create and monitor various data hygiene tasks, including deleting consumer identities and scheduling time-to-live (TTL) protocols for datasets.

This guide covers how to manage data hygiene tasks in the Platform UI. For information on how to perform these tasks using API calls, see the [Data Hygiene API guide](../api/overview.md).

To access the workspace, select **[!UICONTROL Data Hygiene]** in the left navigation.
