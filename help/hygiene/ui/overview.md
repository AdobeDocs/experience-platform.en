# Data hygiene UI guide

The **[!UICONTROL Data cleansing]** workspace in the Adobe Experience Platform UI allows you to create and monitor various data hygiene tasks, including deleting customer identities and scheduling time-to-live (TTL) protocols for datasets.

This guide covers how to manage data hygiene tasks in the Platform UI. For information on how to perform these tasks using API calls, see the [Data Hygiene API guide](../api/overview.md).

To access the workspace, select **[!UICONTROL Data cleansing]** in the left navigation.

From here, you can browse existing work orders and create new data hygiene requests. Refer to the following sections of this guide to learn more:
