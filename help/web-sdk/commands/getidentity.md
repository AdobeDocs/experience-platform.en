# `getIdentity`

When you run the [`sendEvent`](sendevent/overview.md) command, the Web SDK automatically obtains the visitor's identity if one is not already present.

The `getIdentity` command allows you to obtain a visitor ID without sending event data. 

If you require separate calls to generate a visitor ID and send data, you can use this command.

The `getIdentity` command goes through the following flow to retrieve the `ECID`.

1. You use the Web SDK to call either `getIdentity` or [`appendIdentityToUrl`](appendidentitytourl.md).
1. Web SDK waits for consent information to be provided.
1. Web SDK checks whether the `ECID` namespace was requested on the call. By default, the `ECID` namespace is always included.
1. Web SDK reads the `kndctr` cookie and returns its value as `ECID`, if it exists. This only returns the `ECID` value, but not the `regionId`.
1. If the  `kndctr` cookie is not set, Web SDK makes a request to the Edge Network.
1. The Edge Network returns both the `ECID` and the `regionId` (and the `CORE ID`, if requested).

## Get identity using the Web SDK tag extension

The Web SDK tag extension does not offer this command through the tag extension UI. Use the custom code editor using JavaScript library syntax.

## Get identity using the Web SDK JavaScript library

Run the `getIdentity` command when calling your configured instance of the Web SDK. The following options are available when configuring this command:

* **`namespaces`**: An array of namespaces. The default value is `["ECID"]`. Other supported values include:
  * `["CORE"]`
  * `null`
  * `undefined`

  You can request [!DNL ECID] and [!DNL CORE ID] at the same time. Example: `"namespaces": ["ECID","CORE"]`.

* **`edgeConfigOverrides`**: A [datastream configuration override object](datastream-overrides.md).

```js
alloy("getIdentity",{
  "namespaces": ["ECID","CORE"] //this command retrieves both ECID and CORE IDs.
});
```

## Response object

If you decide to [handle responses](command-responses.md) with this command, the following properties are available in the response object:

* **`identity.ECID`**: A string containing the visitor's ECID.
* **`identity.CORE`**: A string containing the visitor's CORE ID.
* **`edge.regionID`**: An integer that represents the Edge Network region that the browser hit when acquiring an identity. It is the same as the legacy Audience Manager location hint.
