# `pushNotifications` {#push-notifications}

> [!AVAILABILITY]
>
> Push notifications for the Web SDK are currently in **beta**. The functionality and documentation may change.

The `pushNotifications` property enables you to configure push notifications for web applications. This feature allows your web app to receive messages pushed from a server, even when the website is not currently loaded in the browser.

## Prerequisites {#prerequisites}

Before configuring push notifications, ensure you have:

1. **User permission**: Users must explicitly grant permission for notifications
2. **Service worker**: A registered service worker is required for push notifications to function
3. **VAPID keys**: Generate VAPID (Voluntary Application Server Identification) keys for secure communication
4. **Application ID**: The app ID used when saving the VAPID keys inside Adobe Journey Optimizer -> Channels -> Push Settings -> Push Credentials
5. **Tracking dataset ID**: The ID of the system dataset with the name "AJO Push Tracking Experience Event Dataset". Get this from Adobe Journey Optimizer -> Datasets

## Generate VAPID keys {#generate-vapid-keys}

To generate VAPID keys, install the `web-push` NPM package and run:

```bash
npm install web-push -g
web-push generate-vapid-keys
```

This generates a public and private key pair. Use the public key in your Web SDK configuration and store the private key within the Adobe Journey Optimizer push notifications channel.

## Install the service worker JavaScript

Service worker code needs to be served from the same domain as the website. Download the service worker code from Adobe's CDN and then host the JavaScript file from your own server. The Web SDK service worker code is available using the following URL structure:

- **Minified**: `https://cdn1.adoberesources.net/alloy/[VERSION]/alloyServiceWorker.min.js`
- **Full**: `https://cdn1.adoberesources.net/alloy/[VERSION]/alloyServiceWorker.js`

Here is an example on how to install the service worker:

```html
<script>
  navigator.serviceWorker.register("/alloyServiceWorker.js", { scope: "/" });
</script>
```

## Configure push notifications using the Web SDK tag extension {#configure-push-notifications-tag-extension}

Follow these steps to enable and configure push notifications:

1. Log in to [experience.adobe.com](https://experience.adobe.com) using your Adobe ID credentials.
1. Navigate to **[!UICONTROL Data Collection]** > **[!UICONTROL Tags]**.
1. Select the desired tag property.
1. Navigate to **[!UICONTROL Extensions]**, then click **[!UICONTROL Configure]** on the [!UICONTROL Adobe Experience Platform Web SDK] card.
1. **Enable push notifications** from the "Custom build components" section.
1. Scroll down to locate the [!UICONTROL Push Notifications] section.
1. Enter your VAPID public key in the **[!UICONTROL VAPID Public Key]** field.
1. Enter your application ID in the **[!UICONTROL Application ID]** field.
1. Enter your tracking dataset ID in the **[!UICONTROL Tracking Dataset ID]** field.
1. Click **[!UICONTROL Save]**, then publish your changes.

> [!NOTE]
>
> Push notifications must be explicitly enabled in the tag extension configuration. The feature is disabled by default.

## Configure push notifications using the Web SDK JavaScript library {#configure-push-notifications-javascript}

Set the `pushNotifications` object when running the `configure` command:

```js
alloy("configure", {
  datastreamId: "ebebf826-a01f-4458-8cec-ef61de241c93",
  orgId: "ADB3LETTERSANDNUMBERS@AdobeOrg",
  pushNotifications: {
    vapidPublicKey:
      "BEl62iUYgUivElbkzaBgNL3r3vOAhvJyFXjS6FjjRRojYD4NElJkLBJKZvS3xAAh4_gE3WnMaZNu_KGP4jAQlJz",
    applicationId: "my-app-id",
    trackingDatasetId: "4dc19305cdd27e03dd9a6bbe",
  },
});
```

## Properties {#properties}

| Property            | Type   | Required | Description                                                                       |
| ------------------- | ------ | -------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `vapidPublicKey`    | String | Yes      | The VAPID public key used for push subscription. Must be a Base64-encoded string. |
| `applicationId`     | String | Yes      | The application ID associated with this VAPID public key.                         |
| `trackingDatasetId` | String | Yes      | The system dataset ID used for push notification tracking.                        |

## Important considerations {#important-considerations}

- **Security**: Push subscriptions are tied to the specific VAPID public key used during subscription. If you change VAPID keys, existing subscriptions are automatically unsubscribed and recreated with the new key.
- **Caching**: The Web SDK automatically manages subscription updates by comparing the current ECID and subscription details with cached values. Subscription data is only sent when changes are detected.
- **Service worker requirement**: Push notifications require a registered service worker. Ensure your service worker is properly configured to handle push events.

## Next steps {#next-steps}

After configuring push notifications, use the [`sendPushSubscription`](../sendPushSubscription.md) command to register push subscriptions with Adobe Experience Platform.
