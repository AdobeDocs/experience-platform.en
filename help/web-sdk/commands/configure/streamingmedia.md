# `streamingMedia`

The `streamingMedia` component helps you collect data related to media sessions on your website. 

The collected data can include information about media playbacks, pauses, completions, and other related events. Once collected, you can send this data to Adobe Experience Platform and/or Adobe Analytics, to generate reports. This feature provides a comprehensive solution for tracking and understanding media consumption behavior on your website.

## Prerequisites {#prerequisites}

To use the `streamingMedia` component of Web SDK, you must meet the following prerequisites:

* Make sure you have access to Adobe Experience Platform and/or Adobe Analytics.
* You must use Web SDK version 2.20.0 or later. See the [Web SDK installation overview](../../install/overview.md) to learn how to install the latest version.
* Enable the **[[!UICONTROL Media Analytics]](../../../datastreams/configure.md#advanced-options)** option for the datastream you are using.
* Ensure that the schema used by your datastream includes the Media Collection schema fields.
* Configure the Streaming Media feature in the Web SDK configuration, as shown in this page, either through the [tag extension](#tag-extension) or through the [JavaScript library](#library).
