# Manage the Media Session Automatically
Creating a media session in automatic mode allows the Web SDK to manage the dispatch of media ping events to Adobe Experience Platform and/or Adobe Analytics. 
The frequency of these pings is determined by the configuration settings of the library.

To start tracking a media session in automatic mode, follow these steps:
1. **Create a Media Collection session**: To start a media session in automatic mode, call the `createMediaSession` method with options:
```javascript
alloy("createMediaSession", {
  playerId: "movie-test",
  getPlayerDetails: () => {
    return {
      playhead: document.getElementById("movie-test").currentTime,
      qoeDataDetails: {
        bitrate: 1000,
        startupTime: 1000,
        fps: 30,
        droppedFrames: 10
      }
    };
  },
  xdm: {
    eventType: "media.sessionStart",
    mediaCollection: {
      sessionDetails: { ... }
    }
  }
});
```

Note: `sessionDetails` object should contain the session details properties, check [Media Collection schema](../../xdm/data-types/media-details-information.md) information.

| name                               | type     | required | description                                                                                                                                            |
|------------------------------------|----------|----------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| playerId                           | string   | yes      | The player ID, an unique identifier representing the media session.                                                                                    |
| getPlayerDetails                   | function | yes      | A function that returns the player details. This callback function will be called by the Web SDK before every media event for the `playerId` provided. |
| xdm.eventType                      | object   | no       | The media event type, if not provided will be set to "media.sessionStart".                                                                             |
| xdm.mediaCollection.sessionDetails | object   | yes      | The session details object.                                                                                                                            |


2. **Handle Media Events**: The Web SDK provides a command to handle media events. This command can be used to track media playbacks, pauses, completions, player state updates, and other related events. 
Since the session is handled automatically, you don't need to pass the sessionID to the media event, or the playhead value. The Web SDK will handle this for you, based on the player ID provided and the `getPlayerDetails` callback function provided when starting the media session.
The XDM object should reflect the media event type details you want to track.
 - Example to track a pause event:
```javascript
alloy("sendMediaEvent", {
  playerId: "movie-test",
  xdm: {
    eventType: "media.pauseStart"
  }
});
```
Note: Notice the playhead and quality of experience data isn't provided in the `sendMediaEvent` command, as the Web SDK will gather it from the `getPlayerDetails` callback function provided when starting the media session.


## Handle Media Events by the event type


### Play
The `media.play` event type is used to track when a media playback starts. This event should be sent when the media starts playing.
```javascript

  }
});
```

### Pause
The `media.pauseStart` event type is used to track when a media playback is paused. This event should be sent when the media is paused.
```javascript
alloy("sendMediaEvent", {
  playerId: "movie-test",

    eventType: "media.pauseStart"
  }
});
```

### Error

          name: "fullScreen"
        }
      ]
    }
  }
});
```
### Session End
This is used to notify the Media Analytics backend to immediately close the session when the user has abandoned their viewing of the content and they are unlikely to return.If you donâ€™t send a sessionEnd, an abandoned session will time-out normally (after no events are received for 10 minutes, or when no playhead movement occurs for 30 minutes), and the session is deleted by the backend```javascript

```javascript
alloy("sendMediaEvent", {
  playerId: "movie-test",
  xdm: {
    eventType: "media.sessionEnd"
  }
});
```

```javascript
alloy("sendMediaEvent", {
