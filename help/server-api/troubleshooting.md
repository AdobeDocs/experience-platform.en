# Troubleshooting

The Adobe Experience Platform Edge Network Server API allows you to capture debug information from services, as your events are processed through the Edge Network data collection pipeline.

The same mechanism which is used by the [Experience Platform Debugger](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/debugger-learn/tutorials/experience-platform-debugger/introduction-to-the-experience-platform-debugger.html?lang=en) enables you to debug API-based implementations.

Using [Project Griffon](https://aep-sdks.gitbook.io/docs/beta/project-griffon), you can create a debugging session ID that you can further use in the Edge Network requests to trace events.
