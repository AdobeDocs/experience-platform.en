# Edge Network Server API overview {#overview}

The Adobe Experience Platform Edge Network provides an optimized way for customers to interact with any Adobe Experience Cloud or Adobe Experience Platform Edge services.

The [!DNL Edge Network Server API] can be used for various data collection, personalization, advertising and marketing use cases. The [!DNL Server API] can be used on servers, [!DNL IoT] devices, set-top boxes, and various other devices.

Since the [!DNL Server API] does not rely on any libraries to load, it provides a lightning-fast way to interact with the Adobe Experience Platform Edge Network and supported solutions.

The benefits of the [!DNL Server API] architecture include:

* Reduced page load time
* Improved latency
* First-party data collection
* Streamlined, server-side communication between services
 
The [!DNL Server API] supports interactive and batch data collection, via two dedicated endpoints:

1. The interactive endpoint supports communication with Adobe Experience Platform and Adobe Experience Cloud services that support advanced segmentation, personalization, and other marketing use cases.
2. The batch endpoint allows requests to be sent in batch when data must be onboarded without receiving a response from the applications being called. 
 
The [!DNL Server API] supports the following type of requests:

* Authenticated requests via [Adobe Developer](https://developer.adobe.com/), using the `server.adobedc.net` endpoint.
* Unauthenticated requests via the `edge.adobedc.net` endpoint.

This enables use cases that allow for secure, authenticated collection of sensitive data, according to your organization's privacy policies. In addition to authentication, the Server API supports marking datastreams to accept only authenticated communication via the API.
