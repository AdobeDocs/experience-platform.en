# Troubleshooting

The Edge Network Gateway API allows you to capture debug information from services, as your events are processed through the Experience Edge data collection pipeline.

The same mechanism which is used by the [Experience Edge Debugger](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/debugger-learn/tutorials/experience-platform-debugger/introduction-to-the-experience-platform-debugger.html?lang=en) enables you to debug API-based implementations.

Using [Griffon](https://aep-sdks.gitbook.io/docs/beta/project-griffon), you can create a debugging session ID that you can further use in the Edge Network Gateway requests to trace events.
