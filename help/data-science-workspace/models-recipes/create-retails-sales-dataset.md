# Create the retail sales schema and dataset

This tutorial provides you with the prerequisites and assets required for all other [!DNL Adobe Experience Platform] [!DNL Data Science Workspace] tutorials. Upon completion, the Retail Sales schema and datasets will be available for you and members of your organization on [!DNL Experience Platform].

## Getting started

Before starting this tutorial, you must have the following prerequisites:
-   Access to [!DNL Adobe Experience Platform]. If you do not have access to an organization in [!DNL Experience Platform], please speak to your system administrator before proceeding.
-   Authorization to make [!DNL Experience Platform] API calls. Complete the [Authenticate and access Adobe Experience Platform APIs](https://www.adobe.com/go/platform-api-authentication-en) tutorial to obtain the following values in order to successful complete this tutorial:
    -   Authorization: `{ACCESS_TOKEN}`
    -   x-api-key: `{API_KEY}`
    -   x-gw-ims-org-id: `{ORG_ID}`
    -   Client secret: `{CLIENT_SECRET}`
    -   Client certificate: `{PRIVATE_KEY}`
-   Sample data and source files for the [Retail Sales Recipe](../pre-built-recipes/retail-sales.md). Download the assets required for this and other [!DNL Data Science Workspace] tutorials from the [Adobe public Git repository](https://github.com/adobe/experience-platform-dsw-reference/).
-   [Python >= 2.7](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and the following [!DNL Python] packages:
    -   [pip](https://pypi.org/project/pip/)
    -   [PyYAML](https://pyyaml.org/)
    -   [dictor](https://pypi.org/project/dictor/)
    -   [JWT](https://pypi.org/project/jwt/)
-   A working understanding of the following concepts used in this tutorial:
    -   [[!DNL Experience Data Model (XDM)]](../../xdm/home.md)
    -   [Basics of schema composition](../../xdm/schema/field-dictionary.md)

## Create Retail Sales schema and dataset

The Retail Sales schema and datasets are created automatically by using the provided bootstrap script. Follow the steps below in order:

### Configure files

1.  Inside the [!DNL Experience Platform] tutorial resource package, navigate into the directory `bootstrap`, and open `config.yaml` using an appropriate text editor. 
2.  Under the `Enterprise` section, input the following values:

    ```yaml
    Enterprise:
        api_key: {API_KEY}
        org_id: {ORG_ID}
        tech_acct: {technical_account_id}
        client_secret: {CLIENT_SECRET}
        priv_key_filename: {PRIVATE_KEY}
    ```

3.  Edit the values found under the `Platform` section, Example shown below:

    ```yaml
    Platform:
        platform_gateway: https://platform.adobe.io
        ims_token: {ACCESS_TOKEN}
        ingest_data: "True"
        build_recipe_artifacts: "False"
        kernel_type: Python
    ```

    -   `platform_gateway`: The base path for API calls. Do not modify this value.
    -   `ims_token`: Your `{ACCESS_TOKEN}` goes here.
    -   `ingest_data`: For the purpose of this tutorial, set this value as `"True"` in order to create the Retail Sales schemas and datasets. A value of `"False"` will only create the schemas.
    -   `build_recipe_artifacts`: For the purpose of this tutorial, set this value as `"False"` to prevent the script from generating a Recipe artifact.
    -   `kernel_type`: The execution type of the Recipe artifact. Leave this value as `Python` if `build_recipe_artifacts` is set as `"False"`, otherwise specify the correct execution type.

4.  Under the `Titles` section, provide the following information appropriately for the Retail Sales sample data, save and close the file after edits are in place. Example shown below:

    ```yaml
    Titles:
        input_class_title: retail_sales_input_class
        input_mixin_title: retail_sales_input_mixin
        input_mixin_definition_title: retail_sales_input_mixin_definition
        input_schema_title: retail_sales_input_schema
        input_dataset_title: retail_sales_input_dataset
        file_replace_tenant_id: DSWRetailSalesForXDM0.9.9.9.json
        file_with_tenant_id: DSWRetailSales_with_tenant_id.json
        is_output_schema_different: "True"
        output_mixin_title: retail_sales_output_mixin
        output_mixin_definition_title: retail_sales_output_mixin_definition
        output_schema_title: retail_sales_output_title
        output_dataset_title: retail_sales_output_dataset
    ```

### Run the bootstrap script

1.  Open your terminal application and navigate to the [!DNL Experience Platform] tutorial resource directory.
2.  Set the `bootstrap` directory as the current working path and run the `bootstrap.py` [!DNL Python] script by entering the following command:

    ```bash
    python bootstrap.py
    ```

    >[!NOTE]
    >
    >The script may take several minutes to complete.

## Next steps

Upon successful completion of the bootstrap script, the Retail Sales input and output schemas and datasets can be viewed on [!DNL Experience Platform]. See the [preview schema data tutorial](./preview-schema-data.md)
for more information.

You have also successfully ingested Retail Sales sample data into [!DNL Experience Platform] using the provided bootstrap script.

To continue working with the ingested data:
- [Analyze your data using Jupyter Notebooks](../jupyterlab/analyze-your-data.md)
    - Use Jupyter Notebooks in Data Science Workspace to access, explore, visualize, and understand your data.
- [Package source files into a Recipe](./package-source-files-recipe.md)
    - Follow this tutorial to learn how to bring your own Model into [!DNL Data Science Workspace] by packaging source files in an importable Recipe file.
