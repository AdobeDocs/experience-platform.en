# Publish a model as a service using the [!DNL Sensei Machine Learning API]

This tutorial covers the process of publishing a model as a service using the [[!DNL Sensei Machine Learning API]](https://www.adobe.io/apis/experienceplatform/home/api-reference.html#!acpdr/swagger-specs/sensei-ml-api.yaml).

## Getting started

This tutorial requires a working understanding of Adobe Experience Platform Data Science Workspace. Before beginning this tutorial, please review the [Data Science Workspace overview](../home.md) for a high-level introduction to the service.

To follow along with this tutorial, you must have an existing ML Engine, ML Instance, and Experiment. For steps on how to create these in the API, see the tutorial on [importing a packaged recipe](./import-packaged-recipe-api.md).

Finally, before starting this tutorial, please review the [getting started](../api/getting-started.md) section of the developer guide for important information that you need to know in order to successfully make calls to the [!DNL Sensei Machine Learning] API, including the required headers used throughout this tutorial:

- `{ACCESS_TOKEN}`
- `{IMS_ORG}`
- `{API_KEY}`

All POST, PUT, and PATCH requests require an additional header:

- Content-Type: application/json

### Key Terms

The following table outlines some common terminology used in this tutorial:

| Term | Definition |
| --- | --- |
| **Machine Learning Instance (ML Instance)** | An instance of a [!DNL Sensei] Engine for a particular tenant, containing specific data, parameters, and [!DNL Sensei] code. |
| **Experiment** | An umbrella entity for holding training Experiment Runs, scoring Experiment Runs, or both. |
| **Scheduled Experiment** | A term to describe the automation of training or scoring Experiment Runs, governed by a user defined schedule. |
| **Experiment Run** | A particular instance of training or scoring Experiments. Multiple Experiment Runs from a particular Experiment may differ in dataset values used for training or scoring. |
| **Trained Model** | A machine learning model created by the process of experimenting and feature engineering before arriving at a validated, evaluated, and finalized model. |
| **Published Model** | A finalized and versioned model arrived at after training, validation, and evaluation. |
| **Machine Learning Service (ML Service)** | A ML Instance deployed as a Service to support on-demand requests for training and scoring using an API endpoint. An ML Service can also be created using existing trained Experiment Runs. |

## Create an ML Service with an existing training Experiment Run and scheduled scoring

When you publish a training Experiment Run as an ML Service, you can schedule scoring by providing details for the scoring Experiment Run the payload of a POST request. This results in the creation of a scheduled Experiment entity for scoring.

**API format**

```http
POST /mlServices

## Creating an ML Service from an existing ML Instance

Depending on your specific use case and requirements, creating an ML Service with an ML Instance is flexible in terms of scheduling training and scoring Experiment Runs. This tutorial will go through the specific cases where:

- [You do not require scheduled training, but require scheduled scoring.](#ml-service-with-scheduled-experiment-for-scoring)
- [You require scheduled Experiment Runs for both training and scoring.](#ml-service-with-scheduled-experiments-for-training-and-scoring)

Note that an ML Service can be created using an ML Instance without scheduling any training or scoring Experiments. Such ML Services will create ordinary Experiment entities and a single Experiment Run for training and scoring.

### ML Service with scheduled Experiment for scoring {#ml-service-with-scheduled-experiment-for-scoring}

You can create an ML Service by publishing an ML Instance with scheduled Experiment Runs for scoring, which will create an ordinary Experiment entity for training. A training Experiment Run is generated and will be used for all scheduled scoring Experiment Runs. Ensure you have the `mlInstanceId`, `trainingDataSetId`, and `scoringDataSetId` required for the creation of the ML Service, and that they exist and are valid values.

### ML Service with scheduled Experiments for training and scoring {#ml-service-with-scheduled-experiments-for-training-and-scoring}

To publish an existing ML Instance as an ML Service with scheduled training and scoring Experiment Runs, you are required to provide both training and scoring schedules. When an ML Service of this configuration is created, scheduled Experiment entities for both training and scoring is also created. Note that training and scoring schedules do not have to be the same. During a scoring job execution, the latest trained model produced by scheduled training Experiment Runs will be fetched and used for the scheduled scoring run.

>[!NOTE]
>
>Retrieving different ML Services may return a response with more or less key-value pairs. The above response is a representation of a [ML Service with both scheduled training and scoring Experiment Runs](#ml-service-with-scheduled-experiments-for-training-and-scoring).


## Schedule training or scoring

If you want to schedule scoring and training on an ML Service that has already been published, you can do so by updating the existing ML Service with a `PUT` request on `/mlServices`.

**API format**

```http
PUT /mlServices/{SERVICE_ID}
```

| Parameter | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `{SERVICE_ID}` | The unique `id` of the ML Service you are updating. |

**Request**

The following request schedules training and scoring for an existing ML Service by adding the `trainingSchedule` and `scoringSchedule` keys with their respective `startTime`, `endTime`, and `cron` keys. 

```SHELL
curl -X PUT 'https://platform.adobe.io/data/sensei/mlServices/{SERVICE_ID}' 
  -H 'Authorization: {ACCESS_TOKEN}' 
  -H 'x-api-key: {API_KEY}' 
  -H 'x-gw-ims-org-id: {IMS_ORG}' 
  -H 'x-sandbox-name: {SANDBOX_NAME}'

        }
      }'
```

>[!WARNING]
>
>Do not attempt to modify the `startTime` on existing scheduled training and scoring jobs. If the `startTime` must be modified, consider publishing the same Model and rescheduling training and scoring jobs.
