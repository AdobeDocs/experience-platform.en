# [!DNL JupyterLab] UI overview

[!DNL JupyterLab] is a web-based user interface for [Project Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) and is tightly integrated into Adobe Experience Platform. It provides an interactive development environment for data scientists to work with Jupyter Notebooks, code, and data.

This document provides an overview of [!DNL JupyterLab] and its features as well as instructions to perform common actions.

## [!DNL JupyterLab] on [!DNL Experience Platform]

Experience Platform's JupyterLab integration is accompanied with architectural changes, design considerations, customized notebook extensions, pre-installed libraries, and an Adobe-themed interface.

The following list outlines some of the features that are unique to JupyterLab on Platform:

| Feature | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Kernels** | Kernels provide notebook and other [!DNL JupyterLab] front-ends the ability to execute and introspect code in different programming languages. [!DNL Experience Platform] provides additional kernels to support development in [!DNL Python], R, PySpark, and [!DNL Spark]. See the [kernels](#kernels) section for more details. |
| **Data access** | Access existing datasets directly from within [!DNL JupyterLab] with full support for read and write capabilities. |
| **[!DNL Platform] service integration** | Built-in integrations allows you to utilize other [!DNL Platform] services directly from within [!DNL JupyterLab]. A complete list of supported integrations is provided in the section on [Integration with other Platform services](#service-integration). |
| **Authentication** | In addition to <a href="https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/latest/security.html" target="_blank">JupyterLab's built-in security model</a>, every interaction between your application and Experience Platform, including Platform service-to-service communication is encrypted and authenticated through the <a href="https://www.adobe.io/authentication/auth-methods.html" target="_blank">[!DNL Adobe Identity Management System] (IMS)</a>. |
| **Development libraries** | In [!DNL Experience Platform], [!DNL JupyterLab] provides pre-installed libraries for [!DNL Python], R, and PySpark. See the [appendix](#supported-libraries) for a complete list of supported libraries. |
| **Library controller** | When the pre-installed libraries are lacking for your needs, additional libraries can be installed for Python and R, and are temporarily stored in isolated containers to maintain the integrity of [!DNL Platform] and keep your data safe. See the [kernels](#kernels) section for more details. |

>[!NOTE]
>
>Additional libraries are only available for the session in which they were installed. You must reinstall any additional libraries you require when starting new sessions.

## Integration with other [!DNL Platform] services {#service-integration}

Standardization and interoperability are key concepts behind [!DNL Experience Platform]. The integration of [!DNL JupyterLab] on [!DNL Platform] as an embedded IDE allows it to interact with other [!DNL Platform] services, enabling you to utilize [!DNL Platform] to its full potential. The following [!DNL Platform] services are available in [!DNL JupyterLab]:

*   **[!DNL Catalog Service]:** Access and explore datasets with read and write functionalities.
*   **[!DNL Query Service]:** Access and explore datasets using SQL, providing lower data access overheads when dealing with large amounts of data.
*   **[!DNL Sensei ML Framework]:** Model development with the ability to train and score data, as well as recipe creation with a single click.
*   **[!DNL Experience Data Model (XDM)]:** Standardization and interoperability are key concepts behind Adobe Experience Platform. [Experience Data Model (XDM)](https://www.adobe.com/go/xdm-home-en), driven by Adobe, is an effort to standardize customer experience data and define schemas for customer experience management.

>[!NOTE]

### Code cells {#code-cells}

Code cells are the primary content of notebooks. They contain source code in the language of the notebook's associated kernel and the output as a result of executing the code cell. An execution count is displayed to the right of every code cell which represents its order of execution.

![](../images/jupyterlab/user-guide/code_cell.png)

Common cell actions are described below:

*   **Add a cell:** Click the plus symbol (**+**) from the notebook menu to add an empty cell. New cells are placed under the cell that is currently being interacted with, or at the end of the notebook if no particular cell is in focus.

*   **Move a cell:** Place your cursor to the right of the cell you wish to move, then click and drag the cell to a new location. Additionally, moving a cell from one notebook to another replicates the cell along with its contents.

*   **Execute a cell:** Click on the body of the cell you wish to execute and then click the **play** icon (**â–¶**) from the notebook menu. An asterisk (**\***) is displayed in the cell's execution counter when the kernel is processing the execution, and is replaced with an integer upon completion.

*   **Delete a cell:** Click on the body of the cell you wish to delete and then click the **scissor** icon.

### Kernels {#kernels}

Notebook kernels are the language-specific computing engines for processing notebook cells. In addition to [!DNL Python], [!DNL JupyterLab] provides additional language support in R, PySpark, and [!DNL Spark] (Scala). When you open a notebook document, the associated kernel is launched. When a notebook cell is executed, the kernel performs the computation and produces results which may consume significant CPU and memory resources. Note that allocated memory is not freed until the kernel is shut down.

Certain features and functionalities are limited to particular kernels as described in the table below:

| Kernel | Library installation support | [!DNL Platform] integrations |
| :----: | :--------------------------: | :-------------------- |
| **[!DNL Python]** | Yes | <ul><li>[!DNL Sensei ML Framework]</li><li>[!DNL Catalog Service]</li><li>[!DNL Query Service]</li></ul> |
| **R** | Yes | <ul><li>[!DNL Sensei ML Framework]</li><li>[!DNL Catalog Service]</li></ul> |
| **Scala** | No | <ul><li>[!DNL Sensei ML Framework]</li><li>[!DNL Catalog Service]</li></ul> |

### Kernel sessions {#kernel-sessions}

Each active notebook or activity on [!DNL JupyterLab] utilizes a kernel session. All active sessions can be found by expanding the **Running terminals and kernels** tab from the left sidebar. The type and state of the kernel for a notebook can be identified by observing the top right of the notebook interface. In the diagram below, the notebook's associated kernel is **[!DNL Python] 3** and the its current state is represented by a grey circle to the right. A hollow circle implies an idling kernel and a solid circle implies a busy kernel.

![](../images/jupyterlab/user-guide/kernel_and_state_1.png)

If the kernel is shut down or inactive for a prolonged period, then **No Kernel!** with a solid circle is shown. Activate a kernel by clicking the kernel status and selecting the appropriate kernel type as demonstrated below:

![](../images/jupyterlab/user-guide/switch_kernel.gif)

### Launcher {#launcher}

[//]: # (Talk about the different Notebooks, introduce that certain starter notebooks are limited to particular kernels)

The customized *Launcher* provides you with useful notebook templates for their supported kernels to help you kickstart your task, including:

| Template | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Blank | An empty notebook file. |
| Starter | A pre-filled notebook demonstrating data exploration using sample data. |
