# Manage permissions for a role

Immediately after [creating a new role](#create-a-new-role), you are returned to the **[!UICONTROL Roles]** tab. If you are editing permissions for an existing role, select the role from the **[!UICONTROL Roles]** tab. Alternatively, use the filter option to filter the results to find a role.

## Filter roles

Select the funnel icon (![Filter icon](../../images/icon.png)) to display a list of filter controls to help narrow results.

The following filters are available for roles in the UI:

| Filter | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [!UICONTROL Created between] | Select a start date and/or an end date to define a date range to filter results by. |
| [!UICONTROL Created by] | Filter by role creator by selecting a user from the dropdown. |
| [!UICONTROL Modified between] | Select a start date and/or an end date to define a date range to filter results by.  |
| [!UICONTROL Modified by] | Filter by role modifier by selecting a user from the dropdown. |

To remove a filter, select the "X" on the pill icon for the filter in question, or select **[!UICONTROL Clear all]** to remove all filters.

## Role details

Select the role from the **[!UICONTROL Roles]** tab, which will open the role's details page.

The details tab provides an overview of the role. The overview displays the role name, role description, the name of the user who created and modified the role, when the role was created and modified, and the permissions attached to the role. The role name, and role description can be modified, if required.

## Manage labels for a role

Select the **[!UICONTROL Labels]** tab to open the roles labels page, then select **[!UICONTROL Add labels]** to assign labels to the role.

![flac-labels](../../images/flac-ui/flac-labels.png)

Labels are listed on this page. The list displays the label name, friendly name, category, and its description.

Select the labels from the list you would like to add to the role, then select **[!UICONTROL Save]**

![flac-add-labels](../../images/flac-ui/flac-add-labels.png)

Added labels appear under **[!UICONTROL Labels]** tab.

To remove a label, select the **X** icon next to the labels's name, to remove the label from the role.

![flac-add-sandboxes](../../images/flac-ui/flac-add-sandboxes.png)

![flac-users](../../images/flac-ui/flac-users.png)

Select the users from the list you would like to add to the role. Alternatively, use the search bar to search for the user by entering their name or email address, then select **[!UICONTROL Save]**

![flac-add-users](../../images/flac-ui/flac-add-users.png)

Added users appear under **[!UICONTROL Users]** tab.
