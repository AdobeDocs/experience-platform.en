# Field level access control overview

Field level access control allows you to configure user access to specific field elements of Adobe Experience Platform including Experience Data Model (XDM) schemas, Profile attributes, and segments. This allows you to better manage access to sensitive personal data (SPD) and personally identifiable information (PII) and also restrict access to this type of data.

Through field level access control, administrators of your organization can control users' access to both SPD and PII across all Platform workflows and resources. Administrators can define specific user roles that have access only to specific fields, as well as only to specific data that correspond to those fields.

## Understanding field level access control

Field level access control involves the following components:

| Terminology | Definition |

| Labels |
| Permissions |
| Policies |
| Roles |
| User groups | User groups are multiple users that have been grouped together and have the access to execute the same functions. |
