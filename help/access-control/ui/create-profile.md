# Create a new product profile in Adobe Admin Console

To start creating a new profile, navigate to the **[!UICONTROL Product Profiles]** tab and select **[!UICONTROL New Profile]**.

![new-profile](../images/new-profile.png)

The **[!UICONTROL Create a new product profile]** dialog appears, prompting you to enter a profile, an optional display name, and an optional description. Under **[!UICONTROL User Notifications]**, you can toggle whether users will be notified by email when they are added or removed from the profile.

When finished, select **[!UICONTROL Next]**.

The next screen prompts you to choose which Platform services to include in the profile. Select the toggle button next to a service to disable it. If a service is disabled, all functions associated with that service will not be available to users assigned to this product profile. When finished, select **[!UICONTROL Save]**.

Users with access to B2B UI can be provisioned for the service through the [!UICONTROL Enable services menu]. Select the toggle beside [!UICONTROL B2B UI] to enable the service for a particular product profile, and then select **[!UICONTROL Save]**.

The new product profile is successfully created, and you are redirected to the profile's [edit permissions page](#edit-permissions). See the sections on [managing permissions](#manage-permissions-for-a-product-profile) and [managing users](#manage-users-for-a-product-profile) for more details on how to manage product profiles once they are created.

## Next steps

With a new product profile created, you can proceed to the next step to [manage permissions for a product profile](permissions.md)
