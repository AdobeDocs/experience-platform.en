# Select a product profile to manage its access control permissions

In order to configure access control for [!DNL Experience Platform] through the Adobe Admin Console, you must be an administrator for an IMS Organization that has a subscription to [!DNL Experience Platform]. While Adobe supports flexible administrator hierarchies for IMS Orgs, you must have system administrator, product administrator, or product profile administrator privileges to configure access control. See the Adobe Help Center article on [administrative roles](https://helpx.adobe.com/enterprise/using/admin-roles.html) for more information.

If you do not have admin privileges, contact your system administrator to gain access.

Once you have admin privileges, go to [Adobe Admin Console](https://adminconsole.adobe.com) and sign in using your Adobe credentials. Once logged in, the **[!UICONTROL Overview]** page appears for the IMS Org you have admin privileges for. This page shows the products that your IMS Org is subscribed to, along with other controls to add users and admins to the IMS Org as a whole. Select **[!UICONTROL Adobe Experience Platform]** to open the access control workspace for your Platform integration.
