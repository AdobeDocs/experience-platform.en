# Manage details and additional services for a product profile

You can configure a profile's details and access to additional services from within the **[!UICONTROL Profile Settings]** menu. To access the menu, select **[!UICONTROL Settings]** from the **[!UICONTROL Product Profile]** page.

Select **[!UICONTROL Next]** to access the **[!UICONTROL Enable services]** page.

The **[!UICONTROL Enable services]** menu allows you to modify a profile's access to additional [!DNL Platform] services that were initially configured when the profile was created. Depending on your [!DNL Platform] subscription, these services can include:

- [!DNL Data Science Workspace]
- [!DNL Query Service]
- [!DNL Adobe Real-Time Customer Data Platform] UI (For Real-Time CDP only)
- B2B UI

Click the toggle on the right side of a particular service to enable or disable it. You can also select the **[!UICONTROL All on]** checkbox to enable or disable all listed services.

When finished, select **[!UICONTROL Save]**.

Customers entitled to the B2B or B2P Edition have access to B2B UI. B2B UI can be provisioned for users through the [!UICONTROL Enable services menu]. Select the toggle beside [!UICONTROL B2B UI] to enable the service for a particular product profile, and then select **[!UICONTROL Save]**.

The B2B UI toggle enables users to view B2B workflows around managing Accounts and Opportunities, as well as create B2B related segments. For more information, see the documentation on [[!DNL Adobe Real-Time Customer Data Platform B2B Edition]](../../rtcdp/b2b-overview.md).
