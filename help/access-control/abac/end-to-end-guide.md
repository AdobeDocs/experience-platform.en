# Attribute-based access control end-to-end guide

Attribute-based access control is a capability of Adobe Experience Platform that gives multi-brand and privacy-conscious customers greater flexibility to manage user access. Access to individual objects, such as schema fields and segments, can be granted/denied with policies based on the object's attributes and role. This feature lets you grant or revoke access to individual objects for specific Platform users in your organization.

This functionality allows you to categorize schema fields, segments, and so on with labels that define organizational or data usage scopes. You can apply these same labels to journeys, Offers, and other objects in Adobe Journey Optimizer. In parallel, administrators can define access policies surrounding Experience Data Model (XDM) schema fields and better manage which users or groups (internal, external, or third-party users) can access those fields.

>[!NOTE]
>
>This document focuses on the use case of access control policies. If you are trying to set up policies to govern the **use** of data rather than which Platform users have access to it, see the end-to-end guide on [data governance](../../data-governance/e2e.md) instead.

## Getting started

This tutorial requires a working understanding of the following Platform components:

* [[!DNL Experience Data Model (XDM)] System](../../xdm/home.md): The standardized framework by which Experience Platform organizes customer experience data.
  * [Basics of schema composition](../../xdm/schema/composition.md): Learn about the basic building blocks of XDM schemas, including key principles and best practices in schema composition.
  * [Schema Editor tutorial](../../xdm/tutorials/create-schema-ui.md): Learn how to create custom schemas using the Schema Editor UI.
* [Adobe Experience Platform Segmentation Service](../../segmentation/home.md): The segmentation engine within [!DNL Platform] used to create audience segments from your customer profiles based on customer behaviors and attributes.

### Use case overview

You will go through an example attribute-based access control workflow where you will create and assign roles, labels, and policies to configure whether your users can or cannot access specific resources in your organization. This guide uses an example of restricting access to sensitive data to demonstrate the workflow. This use case is outlined below:

You are a healthcare provider and want to configure access to resources in your organization.

* Your internal marketing team should be able to access **[!UICONTROL PHI/ Regulated Health Data]** data.
* Your external agency should not be able to access **[!UICONTROL PHI/ Regulated Health Data]** data.

In order to do this, you must configure roles, resources, and policies.

You will:

* [Label the roles for your users](#label-roles): Use the example of a healthcare provider (ACME Business Group) whose marketing group works with external agencies.
* [Label your resources (schema fields and segments)](#label-resources): Assign the **[!UICONTROL PHI/ Regulated Health Data]** label to schema resources and segments.
* * [Activate the policy that will link them together: ](#policy): Enable the default policy to prevent access to schema fields and segments by connecting the labels on your resources to the labels in your role. Users with matching labels will then be given access to the schema field and segment across all sandboxes.

## Permissions

[!UICONTROL Permissions] is the area of Experience Cloud where administrators can define user roles and policies to manage permissions for features and objects within a product application.

Through [!UICONTROL Permissions], you can create and manage roles and assign the desired resource permissions for these roles. [!UICONTROL Permissions] also allow you to manage the labels, sandboxes, and users associated with a specific role.

Contact your system administrator to gain access if you do not have admin privileges.

Once you have admin privileges, go to [Adobe Experience Cloud](https://experience.adobe.com/) and sign in using your Adobe credentials. Once logged in, the **[!UICONTROL Overview]** page appears for your organization you have admin privileges for. This page shows the products your organization is subscribed to, along with other controls to add users and admins to the organization. Select **[!UICONTROL Permissions]** to open the workspace for your Platform integration.

![Image showing the Permissions product being selected in Adobe Experience Cloud](../images/flac-ui/flac-select-product.png)

The Permissions workspace for Platform UI appears, opening on the **[!UICONTROL Roles]** page.

Roles are ways to categorize the types of users interacting with your Platform instance and are building blocks of access control policies. A role has a given set of permissions, and members of your organization can be assigned to one or more roles, depending on the scope of access they need.

To get started, select **[!UICONTROL ACME Business Group]** from the from the **[!UICONTROL Roles]** page.

![Image showing the ACME Business Role being selected in Roles](../images/abac-end-to-end-user-guide/abac-select-role.png)

Next, select **[!UICONTROL Labels]** and then select **[!UICONTROL Add Labels]**.

![Image showing Add labels being selected on the Labels tab](../images/abac-end-to-end-user-guide/abac-select-add-labels.png)

A list of all labels in your organization appears. Select **[!UICONTROL RHD]** to add the label for **[!UICONTROL PHI/Regulated Health Data]**. Allow for a few moments for a blue check mark to appear beside the label, and then select **[!UICONTROL Save]**.

![Image showing the RHD label being selected and saved](../images/abac-end-to-end-user-guide/abac-select-role-label.png)

>[!NOTE]
>
>When adding an organization group to a role, all users in that group will be added to the role. Any changes to the organization group (users removed or added) will be automatically updated within the role.

## Apply labels to schema fields {#label-resources}

Now that you have configured a user role with the [!UICONTROL RHD] label, the next step is to add that same label to the resources that you want to control for that role.

Select **[!UICONTROL Schemas]** from the left navigation and then select **[!UICONTROL ACME Healthcare]** from the list of schemas that appear.

![Image showing the ACME Healthcare schema being selected from the Schemas tab](../images/abac-end-to-end-user-guide/abac-select-schema.png)

Next, select **[!UICONTROL Labels]** to see a list that displays the fields associated with your schema. From here, you can assign labels to one or multiple fields at once. Select the **[!UICONTROL BloodGlucose]** and **[!UICONTROL InsulinLevel]** fields, and then select **[!UICONTROL Apply access and data governance labels]**.

![Image showing the BloodGlucose and InsulinLevel being selected and apply access and data governance labels being selected](../images/abac-end-to-end-user-guide/abac-select-schema-labels-tab.png)

The **[!UICONTROL Edit labels]** dialog appears, allowing you to choose the labels that you want to apply to the schema fields. For this use case, select the **[!UICONTROL PHI/ Regulated Health Data]** label, then select **[!UICONTROL Save]**.

![Image showing the RHD label being selected and saved](../images/abac-end-to-end-user-guide/abac-select-schema-labels.png)

>[!NOTE] 
>
>When a label is added to a field, that label is applied to the parent resource of that field (either a class or a field group). If the parent class or field group is employed by other schemas, those schemas will inherit the same label.

## Apply labels to segments

Once you have completed labeling your schema fields, you can now begin labeling your segments.

Select **[!UICONTROL Segments]** from the left navigation. A list of segments available in your organization is displayed. In this example, the following two segments are to be labeled as they contain sensitive health data:

* Blood Glucose >100
* Insulin <50

Select **[!UICONTROL Blood Glucose >100]** to start labeling the segment.

![Image showing the Blood Glucose >100 being selected from the Segments tab](../images/abac-end-to-end-user-guide/abac-select-segment.png)

The segment **[!UICONTROL Details]** screen appears. Select **[!UICONTROL Manage Access]**.

![Image showing the selection of Manages access](../images/abac-end-to-end-user-guide/abac-segment-fields-manage-access.png)

The **[!UICONTROL Edit labels]** dialog appears, allowing you to choose the labels that you want to apply to the segment. For this use case, select the **[!UICONTROL PHI/ Regulated Health Data]** label, then select **[!UICONTROL Save]**.

![Image showing the selection of the RHD label and save being selected](../images/abac-end-to-end-user-guide/abac-select-segment-labels.png)

Repeat the above steps with **[!UICONTROL Insulin <50]**.

## Activate the access control policy {#policy}

The default access control policy will leverage labels to define which user roles have access to specific Platform resources. In this example, access to schema fields and segments will be denied in all sandboxes for users who aren't in a role that has the corresponding labels in the schema field.

To activate the access control policy, select [!UICONTROL Permissions] from the left navigation and then select **[!UICONTROL Policies]**. 

![List of policies displayed](../images/abac-end-to-end-user-guide/abac-policies-page.png)

Next, select the ellipsis (`...`) next to the policies name, and a dropdown displays controls to edit, activate, delete, or duplicate the role. Select **[!UICONTROL Activate]** from the dropdown.

![Dropdown to activate policy](../images/abac-end-to-end-user-guide/abac-policies-activate.png)

The activate policy dialog appears which prompts you to confirm activation. Select **[!UICONTROL Confirm]**.

![Activate policy dialog](../images/abac-end-to-end-user-guide/abac-activate-policies-dialog.png)

Confirmation of policy activation is received and you are returned to the [!UICONTROL Policies] page.

Access control policies leverage labels to define which user roles have access to specific Platform resources. Policies can either be local or global and can override other policies. In this example, access to schema fields and segments will be denied in all sandboxes for users who don't have the corresponding labels in the schema field.

>[!NOTE]
>
>A "deny policy" is created to grant access to sensitive resources because the role grants permission to the subjects. The written policy in this example **denies** you access if you are missing the required labels.

To create an access control policy, select **[!UICONTROL Permissions]** from the left navigation and then select **[!UICONTROL Policies]**. Next, select **[!UICONTROL Create policy]**.

![Image showing Create policy being selected in the Permissions](../images/abac-end-to-end-user-guide/abac-create-policy.png)

The **[!UICONTROL Create new policy]** dialog appears, prompting you to enter a name and an optional description. Select **[!UICONTROL Confirm]** when finished.

![Image showing the Create new policy dialog and selecting Confirm](../images/abac-end-to-end-user-guide/abac-create-policy-details.png)

To deny access to the schema fields, use the dropdown arrow and select **[!UICONTROL Deny access to]** and then select **[!UICONTROL No resource selected]**. Next, select **[!UICONTROL Schema Field]** and then select **[!UICONTROL All]**.

![Image showing Deny access and resources selected](../images/abac-end-to-end-user-guide/abac-create-policy-deny-access-schema.png)

The table below shows the conditions available when creating a policy:

| Conditions | Description |
| --- | --- |
| The following being false| When 'Deny access to' is set, access will be restricted if the user does not meet the criteria selected. |
| The following being true| When 'Permit access to' is set, access will be permitted if the user meets the selected criteria. |
| Matches any| The user has a label that matches any label applied to a resource. |
| Matches all| The user has all labels that matches all labels applied to a resource. |
| Core label| A core label is an Adobe-defined label that is available in all Platform instances.|
| Custom label| A custom label is a label that has been created by your organization.|

Select **[!UICONTROL The following being false]** and then select **[!UICONTROL No attribute selected]**. Next, select the user **[!UICONTROL Core label]**, then select **[!UICONTROL Matches all]**. Select the resource **[!UICONTROL Core label]** and finally select **[!UICONTROL Add resource]**.

![Image showing the conditions being selected and Add resource being selected](../images/abac-end-to-end-user-guide/abac-create-policy-deny-access-schema-expression.png)

>[!TIP]

## Next steps

You have completed the application of labels to a role, schema fields, and segments. The external agency assigned to these roles are restricted from viewing these labels and their values in the schema, dataset, and profile view. These fields are also restricted from being used in the segment definition when using the Segment Builder.
