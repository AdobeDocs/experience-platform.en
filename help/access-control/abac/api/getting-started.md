# Getting started with the attribute-based access control API

This developer guide provides steps to help you use the attribute-based access control API to manage roles, products, permission categories, and permission sets in Adobe Experience Platform, and includes sample API calls for performing various operations.

## Reading sample API calls

This guide provides example API calls to demonstrate how to format your requests. These include paths, required headers, and properly formatted request payloads. Sample JSON returned in API responses is also provided. For information on the conventions used in the documentation for sample API calls, see the section on [how to read example API calls](../../../landing/troubleshooting.md#how-do-i-format-an-api-request) in the Experience Platform troubleshooting guide.

## Gather values for required headers

This guide requires you to have completed the [authentication tutorial](https://www.adobe.com/go/platform-api-authentication-en) in order to successfully make calls to Platform APIs. Completing the authentication tutorial provides the values for each of the required headers in all Experience Platform API calls, as shown below:

* `Authorization: Bearer {ACCESS_TOKEN}`
* `x-api-key: {API_KEY}`
* `x-gw-ims-org-id: {IMS_ORG}`

In addition to the authentication headers, all requests require a header that specifies the name of the sandbox the operation will take place in:

* `x-sandbox-name: {SANDBOX_NAME}`

All requests that contain a payload (POST, PUT, and PATCH) require an additional header:

* `Content-Type: application/json`

## Next steps

Now that you have gathered the required credentials, you can now continue to read the rest of the developer guide. Each section provides important information regarding their endpoints and demonstrate example API calls for performing CRUD operations. Each call includes the general API format, a sample request showing required headers and properly formatted payloads, and a sample response for a successful call.

See the following API tutorials to start making calls to the attribute-based access control API:

* [Roles endpoint](./roles.md)
* [Products endpoint](./products.md)
