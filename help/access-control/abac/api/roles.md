# Roles endpoint

>[!NOTE]
>
>If a user token is being passed, then the user of the token must have an "org admin" role for the requested org.

Roles define the access that an administrator, a specialist, or an end-user has to resources in your organization. In a role-based access control environment, user access provisioning is group through common responsibilities and needs. A role has a given set of permissions and members of your organization can be assigned to one or more roles, depending on the scope of view or write access they need. 

The `/roles` endpoint in the attribute-based access control API allows you to  programmatically manage roles in your organization.

## Getting started

Before continuing, please review the [getting started guide](./getting-started.md) for links to related documentation, a guide to reading the sample API calls in this document, and important information regarding required headers that are needed to successfully make calls to any Experience Platform API.
