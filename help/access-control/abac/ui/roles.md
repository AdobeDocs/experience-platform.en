# Manage roles

Roles define the access that an administrator, a specialist, or an end-user has to resources in your organization. In a role-based access control environment, user access provisioning is group through common responsibilities and needs. A role has a given set of permissions and members of your organization can be assigned to one or more roles, depending on the scope of view or write access they need.

## Create a new role

To create a new role, select the **[!UICONTROL Roles]** tab in the sidebar and select **[!UICONTROL Create Role]**.

When finished, select **[!UICONTROL Confirm]**.
