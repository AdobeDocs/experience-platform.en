# Permissions guide

[!UICONTROL Permissions] is the area of Adobe Experience Platform where administrators can define user roles and access policies to manage access permissions for features and objects within a product application. 

With [!UICONTROL Permissions], you can configure:

* [Access policies](./policies.md)
* [Labels](./labels.md)
* [Permissions](./permissions.md)
* [Roles](./roles.md)
* [Sandboxes](./sandboxes.md)
* [Users](./users.md)

In order to access attribute-based access control permissions for [!DNL Adobe Experience Platform], you must be an administrator for your organization that has a subscription to [!DNL Adobe Experience Platform]. While Adobe supports flexible administrator hierarchies for your organizations, you must be a product administrator for [!DNL Adobe Experience Platform] to configure permissions. See the Adobe Help Center article on [administrative roles](https://helpx.adobe.com/enterprise/using/admin-roles.html) for more information.

If you do not have admin privileges, contact your system administrator to gain access.

Once you have admin privileges, go to [Adobe Experience Platform](https://experience.adobe.com/) and sign in using your [!DNL Adobe] credentials. Once logged in, the **[!UICONTROL Overview]** page appears for your organization you have admin privileges for. This page shows the products that your organization is subscribed to, along with other controls to add users and admins to the organization as a whole. Select **[!UICONTROL Permissions]** to open the attribute-based access control workspace for your Platform integration.
