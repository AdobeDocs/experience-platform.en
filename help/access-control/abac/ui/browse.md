# Permissions guide

>[!IMPORTANT]

>Attribute-based access control is currently available in a limited release for US-based healthcare customers. This capability will be available to all Real-time Customer Data Platform customers once it is fully released.

Permissions is the area of Adobe Experience Cloud where administrators can define user roles and access policies to manage access permissions for features and objects within a product application. 

With permissions, you can configure:

* [Labels](./labels.md)
* [Permissions](./permissions.md)
* [Policies](./permissions.md)
* [Roles](./roles.md)
* [Sandboxes](./sandboxes.md)
* [Users](./users.md)

In order to access attribute-based access control permissions for [!DNL Experience Cloud], you must be an administrator for your organization that has a subscription to [!DNL Experience Cloud]. While Adobe supports flexible administrator hierarchies for your organizations, you must be a product administrator for Adobe Experience Platform to configure permissions. See the Adobe Help Center article on [administrative roles](https://helpx.adobe.com/enterprise/using/admin-roles.html) for more information.

If you do not have admin privileges, contact your system administrator to gain access.

Once you have admin privileges, go to [Adobe Experience Cloud](https://experience.adobe.com/) and sign in using your Adobe credentials. Once logged in, the **[!UICONTROL Overview]** page appears for your organization you have admin privileges for. This page shows the products that your organization is subscribed to, along with other controls to add users and admins to the organization as a whole. Select **[!UICONTROL Permissions]** to open the attribute-based access control workspace for your Platform integration.

The attribute-based access control workspace for Adobe Experience Cloud appears, opening on the **[!UICONTROL Roles]** page. This page allows you to view all roles and manage various settings as outlined in this document.

>Once your organization is enabled for attribute-based access control, you can start using Permissions on Adobe Experience Cloud, instead of Product Profiles in the Adobe Admin Console, to manage permissions for users, functionality, labels, and other resources in your organization.
