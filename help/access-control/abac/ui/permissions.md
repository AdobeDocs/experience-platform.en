# Manage permissions for a role

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>Access control uses user ID (an internal unique id assigned to a user) for granting permissions. When an organization is migrated from Adobe ID to Business ID, all permissions set for its users will be lost because the user ID changes and access control will use the newly generated user ID. If your organization is migrated to Business ID, please contact your Adobe representative to migrate your user ID from Adobe ID to Business ID.

Permissions is the area of Experience Cloud where administrators can define user roles and access policies to manage access permissions for features and objects within a product application.

Through Permissions, you can create and manage roles, as well as assign the desired resource permissions for these roles. Permissions also allow you to manage the labels, sandboxes, and users associated with a specific role.

Immediately after [creating a new role](#create-a-new-role), you are returned to the **[!UICONTROL Roles]** tab. If you are editing permissions for an existing role, select the role from the **[!UICONTROL Roles]** tab. Alternatively, use the filter option to filter the results to find a role.

## Filter roles

Select the funnel icon (![Filter icon](/help/images/icons/filter.png)) to display a list of filter controls to help narrow results.

![The Roles dashboard in the Permissions UI with the filter roles section highlighted.](../../images/flac-ui/flac-filters.png)

The following filters are available for roles in the UI:

| Filter | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [!UICONTROL Created between] | Select a start date and/or an end date to define a date range to filter results by. |
| [!UICONTROL Created by] | Filter by role creator by selecting a user from the dropdown. |
| [!UICONTROL Modified between] | Select a start date and/or an end date to define a date range to filter results by.  |
| [!UICONTROL Modified by] | Filter by role modifier by selecting a user from the dropdown. |

To remove a filter, select the "X" on the pill icon for the filter in question, or select **[!UICONTROL Clear all]** to remove all filters.
