# Manage access control policies

Access control policies are statements that bring attributes together to establish permissible and impermissible actions. Access policies can either be local or global, and can override other policies.

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>Access policies are not to be confused with data usage policies, which control how data is used in Adobe Experience Platform instead of which users in your organization have access to it. See the guide on creating [data usage policies](../../../data-governance/policies/create.md) for more information.

## Create a new policy
