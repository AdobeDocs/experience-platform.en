# Reference endpoint

You can list the names of all permissions and resource types by making a GET request to the `/acl/reference` endpoint. These names can then be used in API calls to [view effective access control policies](./effective-policies.md) for the current user.

A permission is a policy that is managed through the Adobe Admin Console, and maps to zero or more resource-type policies. A resource type is a policy that enables read, write, and/or delete capabilities for a specific type of [!DNL Platform] resource (such as datasets or schemas).

**API format**

```http
GET /acl/reference
```

**Request**

```shell
curl -X GET \
  https://platform.adobe.io/data/foundation/access-control/acl/reference \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer {ACCESS_TOKEN}' \
  -H 'x-api-key: {API_KEY}' \
  -H 'x-gw-ims-org-id: {ORG_ID}'
```

**Response**

A successful response returns a `permissions` object and a `resource-types` object, each containing a full list of names for access permissions or resource types, respectively.
