# Audience Manager Expanded Activation

Built on Adobe Experience Platform, Audience Manager Expanded Activation helps existing [Audience Manager](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/audience-manager/user-guide/aam-home) users activate their audiences to [social](../destinations/catalog/social/overview.md) and [advertising](../destinations/catalog/advertising/overview.md) destination platforms from Real-Time CDP, such as [Facebook](../destinations/catalog/social/facebook.md), [Google Ads](../destinations/catalog/advertising/google-ads-destination.md), and more.

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>[!DNL Audience Manager Expanded Activation] is only available to existing [!DNL Audience Manager] users.

## Terminology {#terminology}

Audience Manager Expanded Activation uses concepts and components from Adobe Experience Platform. To better understand the Expanded Activation workflow and the components that you will be using, make sure you have a basic understanding of the following concepts:

* [Audiences](../segmentation/ui/overview.md): Audiences are sets of people who share similar behaviors and/or characteristics. This collection of people can either be generated by Adobe Experience Platform using segment definitions or audience composition (Experience Platform-generated audience) or from external sources such as custom uploads (externally generated audience). In Expanded Activation, your Audience Manager segments (audiences) are imported as [custom uploads](../segmentation/ui/audience-portal.md#import-audience).
* [Source connectors](../sources/home.md): Source connectors (also known as sources) help Experience Platform users easily ingest data from multiple sources, allowing the structuring, labeling and enhancement of data using Experience Platform services. Data can be ingested from a variety of sources such as cloud-based storage, third party software, and CRM systems.
* [Destination connectors](../destinations/home.md): Destinations describe any endpoint, such as an Adobe application, advertising platform, cloud storage service, or marketing service, where an audience is activated and delivered. [!DNL Expanded Activation] supports the activation of audiences to [advertising](../destinations/catalog/advertising/overview.md) and [social](../destinations/catalog/social/overview.md) destination connectors.

## Prerequisites {#prerequisites}

Before you can activate audiences through Expanded Activation, make sure you meet the prerequisites described below.

### User and role requirements {#permission-requirements}

Before you can use [!DNL Expanded Activation], you must create a user account from the Admin Console and assign it to the [!DNL Expanded Activation] role. See the [administration](administration.md) page for detailed instructions on how to do this.

### Audience requirements {#audience-requirements} 

To activate audiences through [!DNL Expanded Activation], make sure that your Audience Manager audiences are based on **hashed email addresses**. There are two ways to ensure this, based on your Audience Manager usage:

* If you are using the [Audience Manager People-based Destinations](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/audience-manager/user-guide/features/destinations/people-based/people-based-destinations-overview) functionality, then you are already ingesting hashed email addresses in Audience Manager. There is no additional step that you need to take in this case. You can skip to [activating audiences through Expanded Activation](activate-audiences.md).
* If you are _not_ using the [Audience Manager People-based Destinations](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/audience-manager/user-guide/features/destinations/people-based/people-based-destinations-overview) functionality, you must create a new data source in Audience Manager, and use it to store hashed email addresses. See the documentation on [configuring a data source for hashed email workflows](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/audience-manager/user-guide/features/data-sources/create-data-source-hashed-emails) to learn how to do this. After you have ingested hashed email addresses in your Audience Manager data source, read the documentation on [activating audiences through Expanded Activation](activate-audiences.md).

## Next steps {#next-steps}

Now that you have a better understanding of the use cases and benefits of using [!DNL Expanded Activation], start [configuring your account](administration.md) and then [activate your audiences](activate-audiences.md).
