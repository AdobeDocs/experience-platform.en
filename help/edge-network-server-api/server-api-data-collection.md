# Data collection

The [!DNL Server API] offers two types of data collection endpoints:

1. [Interactive data collection endpoints](interactive-data-collection.md), used when the client expects a response to be returned by the server. These endpoints can also return content from other Experience Edge services, while performing data collection.
2. [Non-interactive event data collection](non-interactive-data-collection.md), used when no response is expected from the server. These endpoints are used only for data collection.

## The `Event` object {#event-object}

Data collected by the [!DNL Server API] is structured in the `Event` object. The structure of this object is described below.

| Attribute | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `xdm`| Object | *Required*. JSON object containing data in XDM format, corresponding to the dataset schema. |
| `data` | Object | *Optional*. JSON object containing free-form data, which can be mapped to XDM by the Edge Network. |
