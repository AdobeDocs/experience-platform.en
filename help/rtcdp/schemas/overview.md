# Schemas in Real-Time Customer Data Platform

All data that is brought into Adobe Real-Time Customer Data Platform must conform to a standard, denormalized structure in order for it be recognized and acted upon by downstream capabilities and features. Experience Data Model (XDM) is the standard framework that provides this structure in the form of schemas.

After creating schemas, you can map the structure of data to XDM so that it can be ingested into the system.

For more information on XDM and how to manage schemas in the UI, refer to the [XDM documentation](../../xdm/home.md). If you are using Real-Time Customer Platform B2B Edition, see the document on [schemas in Real-Time CDP B2B Edition](./b2b.md) for information on B2B-specific applications for XDM.
