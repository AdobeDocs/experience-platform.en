# Schemas in Real-time Customer Data Platform B2B Edition

Real-time Customer Data Platform B2B Edition provides several standard [Experience Data Model (XDM) classes](../../xdm/schema/composition.md#class) that capture details about essential B2B data entities, such as accounts, opportunities, campaigns, and more. In addition, Real-time CDP B2B Edition allows you to define many-to-one relationships between these schemas so they can participate in advanced segmentation use cases.

The following standard classes are provided in Real-time CDP B2B Edition:

<!-- #PLACEHOLDER Links to be added later -->

* XDM Business Account
* XDM Business Account Person Relation
* XDM Business Campaign
* XDM Business Campaign Members
* XDM Business Opportunity
* XDM Business Opportunity Person Relation
* XDM Business Marketing List
* XDM Business Marketing List Members

For steps on how to create a many-to-one relationship between two schemas, refer to the tutorial on [#PLACEHOLDER defining B2B schema relationships].

If you are using a B2B source connection, you can use a tool to automatically generate the required schemas and the relationships between them. See the guide on [B2B namespaces](../../sources/connectors/adobe-applications/marketo/marketo-namespaces.md) in the sources documentation for more information.
