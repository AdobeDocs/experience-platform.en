# Sources in Real-Time Customer Data Platform B2B Edition

>[!NOTE]
>
>If you are not using Adobe Real-Time Customer Data Platform B2B Edition, see the [sources overview](./sources-overview.md) instead.

Adobe Real-Time Customer Data Platform B2B Edition allows you to bring your B2B data through various sources including the [[!DNL Marketo Engage]](../../sources/connectors/adobe-applications/marketo/marketo.md) source connector, Salesforce, Amazon S3, and ADLS among others. This range of sources provides you with the ability to structure, label, and enhance incoming data using services.

To understand how sources fit into your B2B workflow, please see the [end-to-end tutorial](../b2b-tutorial.md#ingest-your-data-into-experience-platform).

See the [source connectors overview](../../sources/home.md) for more information on the types of sources available in Adobe Experience Platform.
