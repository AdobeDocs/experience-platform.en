# Sources in Real-time Customer Data Platform B2B Edition (Beta)

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>Real-time Customer Data Platform B2B Edition is currently in beta. The documentation and functionality are subject to change.

>[!NOTE]
>
>If you are not using Real-time Customer Data Platform B2B Edition, see the [sources overview](./sources-overview.md) instead.

Real-time Customer Data Platform B2B Edition allows you to bring your B2B data through the [[!DNL Marketo Engage]](../../sources/connectors/adobe-applications/marketo/marketo.md) source connector while providing you with the ability to structure, label, and enhance incoming data using services.

>[!TIP]
>
>While Real-time Customer Data Platform B2B Edition offers a broad range of external sources from which to ingest data, it does not have as many as those available for Real-time Customer Data Platform. To learn which source connectors are available to your organization, you can view the sources catalog in the Platform UI. To access the catalog, select **Sources** in the left navigation, then select **Catalog**.

See the [source connectors overview](../../sources/home.md) for more information on the types of sources available in Adobe Experience Platform.

The following documents provide more information on using [!DNL Marketo] to bring B2B data to Platform:

* For information on how to connect your [!DNL Marketo] data to Platform, see the tutorial on [creating a Marketo source connector in the UI](../../sources/tutorials/ui/create/adobe-applications/marketo.md).
* For information on the underlying setup for the B2B namespaces and schemas used with [!DNL Marketo], see the documentation for [B2B namespaces and schemas](../../sources/connectors/adobe-applications/marketo/marketo-namespaces.md).
* For information on finding your [!DNL Marketo] Munchkin ID and generating your credentials, see the [[!DNL Marketo] authentication guide](../../sources/connectors/adobe-applications/marketo/marketo-auth.md).
