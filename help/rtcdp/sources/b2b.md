# Sources in Real-time Customer Data Platform B2B Edition

Real-time Customer Data Platform B2B Edition allows you to bring your B2B data to be ingested from [sources](../../sources/home.md) while providing you with the ability to structure, label, and enhance incoming data using services. You can use the [[!DNL Marketo Engage] source](../../sources/connectors/adobe-applications/marketo/marketo.md) to bring B2B data to Platform.
