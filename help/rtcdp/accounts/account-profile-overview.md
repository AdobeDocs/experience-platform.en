Account profiles enable you to aggregate account information from multiple sources and deduplicate account data from a single source. These aggregated views of an account bring together data from across your many marketing channels and the diverse systems that your organization is currently using to store customer account data.

By stitching together account data from different sources, you can begin to see a complete picture of each of your customer accounts and its related opportunities and contacts. This unified view enables your organization to take your B2B marketing campaigns to a new level. To learn more about the power of Real-time CDP, B2B Edition, read the [Real-time CDP, B2B Edition example use case](../b2b-sample-use-case.md).

## Account profile viewer

With Real-time CDP, B2B Edition, you can use the Experience Platform user interface to view account profiles and search for specific accounts using an account id from a connected enterprise source or by entering source details ad-hoc. For more information regarding how to view account profiles within the Platform UI, please see the [account profile UI guide](account-profile-ui-guide.md).
