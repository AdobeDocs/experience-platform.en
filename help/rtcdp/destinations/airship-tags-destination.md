# Airship Tags {#your-destination}


## Overview

Overview here

>[!TIP]
>
>This documentation page was created by the *YOURDESTINATION* team. For any inquiries or update requests, please contact them directly at *Insert link or email address where you can be reached for updates*

## Prerequisites

*Add information in this section about anything that customers need to be aware of before starting to set up the destination in the Real-time CDP user interface. This can be about:*

* needing to be added to an allow list
* requirements for email hashing
* account specifics on YOURDESTINATION side

*You can link out to your relevant documentation if that would be useful to customers.*

## Use Cases

To help you better understand how and when you should use the *YOURDESTINATION* destination, here are sample use cases that Adobe Real-time Customer Data Platform customers can solve by using this destination.


### Use Case #1

*For mobile messaging platforms:*

*A home rental and sales platform wants to push mobile notifications to customers' Android and iOS devices to let them know that there are 100 updated listings in the area where they previously searched for a rental.*

### Use Case #2

*For social network platforms:*

*An athletic apparel brand wants to reach existing customers through their social media accounts. The apparel brand can ingest email addresses from their own CRM to Adobe Real-time CDP, build segments from their own offline data, and send these segments to YOURDESTINATION, to display ads in their customers' social media feeds.*

## Connect to destination {#connect-destination}

*Replace YOURDESTINATION with your destination name and TOBEFILLED with the category that your destination belongs to.*

1. In **[!UICONTROL Destinations]** > **[!UICONTROL Catalog]**, scroll to the ***TOBEFILLEDIN*** category. Select ***YOURDESTINATION***, then select **[!UICONTROL Configure]**.


    >[!NOTE]
    >
    >If a connection with this destination already exists, you can see an **[!UICONTROL Activate]** button on the destination card.

    ![Connect to YOURDESTINATION](/help/rtcdp/templates/assets/yourdestination1.png)

2. In the **Account** step, if you had previously set up a connection to your *YOURDESTINATION* destination, select **[!UICONTROL Existing Account]** and select your existing connection. Or, you can select **[!UICONTROL New Account]** to set up a new connection to *YOURDESTINATION*. Select **[!UICONTROL Connect to destination]** to log in and connect Adobe Experience Cloud to your *YOURDESTINATION* account.

    >[!NOTE]
    >
    >Adobe Real-time CDP supports credentials validation in the authentication process and displays an error message if you input incorrect credentials to your ***YOURDESTINATION*** account. This ensures that you don't complete the workflow with incorrect credentials.

3. Once your credentials are confirmed and Adobe Experience Cloud is connected to your ***YOURDESTINATION*** account, you can select **[!UICONTROL Next]** to proceed to the **[!UICONTROL Setup]** step.

4. In the **[!UICONTROL Authentication]** step, enter a **[!UICONTROL Name]** and a **[!UICONTROL Description]** for your activation flow and fill your account ID. <br> Also in this step, you can select any **[!UICONTROL Marketing use case]** that should apply to this destination. Marketing use cases indicate the intent for which data will be exported to the destination. You can select from Adobe-defined marketing use cases or you can create your own marketing use case. For more information about marketing use cases, see the [Data Governance in Real-time CDP](/help/rtcdp/privacy/data-governance-overview.md#destinations) page. For information about the individual Adobe-defined marketing use cases, see the [Data usage policies overview](/help/data-governance/policies/overview.md#core-actions). <br> Select **[!UICONTROL Create Destination]** after you filled in the fields above.

Set up a mapping between any other attributes you plan to use.

You cannot complete the segment activation workflow until you have resolved the violation. For information on how to resolve policy violations, see [Policy enforcement](/help/rtcdp/privacy/data-governance-overview.md#enforcement) in the data governance documentation section.
