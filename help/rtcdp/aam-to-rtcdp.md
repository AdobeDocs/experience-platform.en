# Evolution from Audience Manager to Real-Time CDP

As your organization evolves to use Adobe Real-Time CDP, explore these considerations to prepare your data and to become aware of critical differences between the two technologies. This article is aimed at a practitioner audience.

## 1. Consider data architecture within Audience Manager

As you consider the evolution from Audience Manager to Real-Time CDP, now is a critical time to analyze your [Audience Manager segments](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/audience-manager/user-guide/features/segments/segments-purpose.html?lang=en) and determine what the [signals](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/audience-manager/user-guide/features/data-explorer/data-explorer-understanding-signals.html?lang=en), [traits](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/audience-manager/user-guide/features/traits/trait-details-page.html?lang=en), and [rules](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/audience-manager/user-guide/features/segments/segment-builder.html?lang=en#segment-builder-section) are that make up those segments.

Furthermore, think about the data sources that you currently use in Audience Manager.

Adobe recommends that you categorize your segments as follows: 

* Segments that can be sent to Experience Platform via the [[!UICONTROL Audience Manager Source Connector]](/help/sources/connectors/adobe-applications/audience-manager.md), as they have no data dependencies, no destination or activation challenges, and their segmentation rules can be created through the Real-time CDP [segment builder](/help/segmentation/ui/segment-builder.md) later. 
* Segments that have rules that can be supported but may have contain data that won't be available in Real-Time CDP.
* Segments that cannot be created in Real-time CDP and are missing functionality.

>[!TIP]
>
>Adobe Real-Time CDP offers [three types of segment evaluation](/help/segmentation/home.md#evaluate-segments): [!UICONTROL Batch], [!UICONTROL Streaming], and [!UICONTROL Edge]. Customers who use real-time segments in Audience Manager may be restricted by the current limitation of 500 streaming segments in Real-Time CDP. Read more about [segmentation guardrails](/help/profile/guardrails.md).

## 2. Which segments are critical to send through via [!UICONTROL Audience Manager Source Connector]?

Based on their evaluation criteria, segments that have no data dependencies, no destination or activation challenges, and their segmentation rules can be created through Real-Time CDP data collection like [Adobe Experience Platform Web SDK](/help/edge/web-sdk-faq.md) at a later date should be sent through the Audience Manager Source Connector.

## 3. Will you be using the [!UICONTROL Experience Cloud Audiences] destination to bring data back to Audience Manager?

Segments that have rules that can be supported in Real-Time CDP but have activation dependencies to Audience Manager could be sent to Audience Manager via the [Experience Cloud Audiences](/help/destinations/catalog/adobe/experience-cloud-audiences.md) destination card.

## 4. Which destinations do you have in place in Audience Manager today that you can start moving to Real-Time CDP?

Adobe strongly recommends that segments activated in Audience Manager to [people-based destinations](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/audience-manager/user-guide/features/destinations/people-based/people-based-destinations-overview.html?lang=en) get pushed to Real-Time CDP via the [!UICONTROL Audience Manager Source Connector], to then activate through Real-Time CDP. 

All people-based destinations available in Audience Manager - [Facebook](/help/destinations/catalog/social/facebook.md), [[!UICONTROL Google Customer Match]](/help/destinations/catalog/advertising/google-customer-match.md), [LinkedIn](/help/destinations/catalog/social/linkedin.md) - are also available in Real-Time CDP.

Additional first-party data and media strategy partners like [Pinterest](/help/destinations/catalog/advertising/pinterest.md), [Snapchat](/help/destinations/catalog/advertising/snap-inc.md), [TikTok](/help/destinations/catalog/social/tiktok.md), [Amazon Ads](/help/destinations/catalog/advertising/amazon-ads.md), and [[!UICONTROL The Trade Desk]](/help/destinations/catalog/advertising/tradedesk.md) are available. 

Real-Time CDP currently supports more than 60 destinations natively in the [catalog](/help/destinations/catalog/overview.md), over 20 of which are advertising or social destinations that support first-party audience matching.
