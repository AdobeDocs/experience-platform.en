# Data quality in Real-time Customer Data Platform

Real-time Customer Data Platform (Real-time CDP) allows you to bring data from multiple sources and bridge them together to give a consistent and coordinated experience for your customers. As a result, ensuring your data is complete, accurate, and concise is of utmost importance. 

Real-time CDP is built on top of Adobe Experience Platform and utilizes many of the Experience Platform services and functionalities. Thus, you can be confident that your data will be checked and validated as it is ingested.

For more detailed information about data quality, please read the [data quality documentation on Adobe I/O](../../ingestion/quality/overview.md).
