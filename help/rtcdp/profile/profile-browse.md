# Browse profiles in Real-time Customer Data Platform

Real-time Customer Profile creates a holistic view of each of your individual customers, combining data from multiple channels including online, offline, CRM, and third-party data. As individual profiles are aggregated based on data being brought into the system from various sources, each profile becomes an actionable, timestamped account of every interaction your customer has with your brand.

Within the Adobe Experience Platform user interface, you can view these read-only profiles and see important information regarding each of your individual customers, including their preferences, past events, interactions, and the segments to which the individual belongs.

Real-time Customer Data Platform is built on top of Adobe Experience Platform and is thereby able to make use of the profile viewing capabilities in the Experience Platform UI. For a detailed guide to viewing customer profiles within the Platform user interface, please see the [Real-time Customer Profile user guide](../../profile/ui/user-guide.md).
