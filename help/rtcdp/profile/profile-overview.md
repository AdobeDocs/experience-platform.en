# Real-Time Customer Profile overview

Real-Time Customer Profile enables you to see a holistic view of each individual customer by combining data from multiple channels, including online, offline, CRM, and third party data. Each individual customer profile allows you to consolidate your disparate customer data into a unified view offering an actionable, timestamped account of every customer interaction.
