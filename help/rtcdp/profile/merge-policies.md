# Merge policies overview

Adobe Experience Platform enables you to bring data together from multiple sources and combine it in order to see a complete view of each of your individual customers. When bringing this data together, merge policies are the rules that [!DNL Platform] uses to determine how data will be prioritized and what data will be combined to create that unified view of the profile.

Through a RESTful API and the Experience Platform user interface, you can create new merge policies, manage existing policies, and set a default merge policy for your organization. You can also specify preferences regarding data sources and determine which data has priority should a conflict arise while merging.

To learn more about merge policies and the role they play within Experience Platform, please begin by reading the [merge policies overview](../../profile/merge-policies/overview.md).
