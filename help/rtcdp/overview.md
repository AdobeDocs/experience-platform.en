# Real-time Customer Data Platform overview

Built on Adobe Experience Platform, Real-time Customer Data Platform (Real-time CDP) helps companies bring together known and anonymous data from multiple enterprise sources in order to create  customer profiles that can be used to provide personalized customer experiences across all channels and devices in real time.

Real-time CDP includes tools for data governance, identity management, advanced segmentation, and data science so that you can build profiles and define audiences, as well as derive rich insights while being able to enforce strict data governance policies.

Real-time Customer Data Platform connects to a large ecosystem of partners, not to mention native integrations with Adobe Experience Cloud, so you can seamlessly activate these audiences and deliver great customer experiences across all channels, from on-site or in-app personalization to email, paid media, call centers, connected devices, and more.

With Real-time Customer Data Platform, you can:

* Achieve a single view of your customer by combining data from across the enterprise.
* Responsibly manage profiles with trusted governance and privacy controls for known and anonymous identifiers.
* Generate actionable insights and scale audiences with AI and machine learning powered by Adobe Sensei and built for marketers.
