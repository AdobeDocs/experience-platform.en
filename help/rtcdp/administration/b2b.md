# Access control in Adobe Real-Time Customer Data Platform B2B Edition

Access control for Real-Time CDP B2B Edition is administered through the [Adobe Admin Console](https://adminconsole.adobe.com). This functionality leverages product profiles in [!DNL Admin Console], allowing you to link users with permissions and sandboxes. Using this feature, administrators can grant or restrict access to specific Real-Time CDP capabilities, such as B2B UI, for defined sets of users.

To learn more about access control, see the [access control overview](../../access-control/home.md) in the [!DNL Experience Platform] documentation.

See the following documents for detailed instructions on how to use the [Adobe Admin Console](https://adminconsole.adobe.com) to enable B2B UI access for a product profile:

* [Enable B2B UI for a new product profile](../../access-control/ui/create-profile.md)
* [Enable B2B UI for an existing product profile](../../access-control/ui/details-and-services.md)
