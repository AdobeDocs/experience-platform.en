## How it works

CUSTOMER licenses attributes from PARTNER
CUSTOMER extends their Profile data & governance model to accommodate PARTNERÂ provided attributes
CUSTOMER exports audiences they want enriched keyed off-of PII/hashed-PII to PARTNER
PARTNER appends licensed attributes for profiles they're able to match against
Optionally a Partner ID can be included and ingested into the partner scoped ID namespace
RTCDP appends enriched attributes into profile
 
## In the product

You need to create a new identity type of type Partner ID. Link to how to create a new identity and to the Partner ID identity type

Create a new schema or extend an existing schema to include attributes that you are expecting to get back from the partner. 

## Limitations

Partner IDs are not ingested into Identity service.
