# Segmentation use cases for Real-Time Customer Data Platform B2B Edition

This document provides examples of segment definitions in Adobe Real-Time Customer Data Platform B2B Edition and how different types of attributes can be combined for common B2B use cases. To understand how destinations fit into your B2B workflow, please see the [end-to-end tutorial](../b2b-tutorial.md#create-a-segment-to-evaluate-your-data).

>[!NOTE]
>
>The attributes required for these segmentation use cases are only available to Real-Time Customer Data Platform B2B Edition customers. If you are not using Real-Time Customer Data Platform B2B Edition, see the [segmentation overview](./segmentation-overview.md) instead.

## Prerequisites {#prerequisites}

Before you can use the segmentation attributes for B2B classes, you must complete the following steps:

1. Create schemas that use the B2B classes. The B2B Edition classes include Account, Campaign, Opportunity, Marketing List, and more. For information on [how to set up schemas for use with B2B classes](../schemas/b2b.md) please see the schema documentation.
1. Create relationships between your Experience Data Model (XDM) B2B schemas. Segments based on B2B Edition attributes require relationships between the classes to fully use the extended B2B Segmentation functionality. See the documentation on [how to define a relationship between two B2B schemas](../../xdm/tutorials/relationship-b2b.md) for more information.
1. Ingest data using datasets based on your B2B schemas. See the sources documentation for [information on how to ingest data](../../sources/connectors/adobe-applications/marketo/marketo.md).
1. Read the [Segment builder user guide](../../segmentation/ui/segment-builder.md) for a more detailed guidance on how to build audiences.

Once these requirements have been met you are able to combine these attributes for common B2B use cases.

## Getting started {#getting-started}

Once the union schemas for the B2B classes have relationships established and have been used to ingest data, their attributes are made available in the left rail of the Segment Builder. 

B2B classes and their attributes are appended with a `B2B` label within the Segmentation workspace to differentiate them from those available as standard within Real-Time Customer Data Platform. 

In order to effectively create audiences for B2B use cases, it is important to have an intimate knowledge of the schema and understand what the data model looks like. It is also useful to be aware of the path that the data takes from one data object to another.

The image below illustrates the relationships between the B2B classes available within Real-Time CDP B2B Edition.

![B2B class ERD](../assets/segmentation/b2b-classes.png)

Since your data model can be complicated, you can use the Platform UI to view a more detailed visual representation of your data model in order to help find the relevant attributes for your use case. To start, go to the Platform UI and select Schemas in the left navigation.

Select the appropriate schema from the available list and select the appropriate relationship from the [!UICONTROL Composition] side rail. In the example below, selecting the "Person" relationship reveals which attribute in the current schema references the related "Person" schema (if it is the source schema in the relationship), or is referenced by the "Person" schema (if it is the reference schema in the relationship).

![source-key example using the people relationship in the schema workspace](../assets/segmentation/source-key-schema-relationship-example.png)

This relationship is reflected within the Segment Builder through the use of `Key` folders as shown in the image below.

![source-key example using the segment builder in the segmentation workspace](../assets/segmentation/source-key-segmentation-example.png)

Please refer to the [schemas in Real-Time Customer Data Platform B2B Edition documentation](../schemas/b2b.md) for more information on the available B2B classes.

The use cases below provide information on which classes are used to establish relationships between the different schemas to achieve these results. These examples can be used to help you create your own segments.

## Examples of different segmentation use cases {#use-cases}

The following use cases are available for segmentation with the B2B Edition. Each example provides a description of what the audience does and a description of the classes used to create them. The images provided highlight the file path in the [!UICONTROL Attributes] side rail which reflects the structure of the schema. The [!UICONTROL Segment properties] section on the right of the display contains a written breakdown of the audience's attributes. 

### Example 1: Find "decision-makers" for B2B opportunities {#find-decision-maker}

Find all the people who are the "Decision Maker" of any opportunity. This audience requires a link between the [!UICONTROL XDM Individual Profile] class and the [!UICONTROL XDM Business Opportunity Person Relation] class. 

![UI displaying example 1 settings](../assets/segmentation/example-1.png)

### Example 2: Find B2B profiles assigned to opportunities over a certain dollar amount {#find-opportunities-amount}

Find all the people who are directly assigned to any opportunities of which the opportunity amount is more than the given amount ($1 million). This audience requires a link between the [!UICONTROL XDM Individual Profile] class, [!UICONTROL XDM Business Opportunity Person Relation] class, and [!UICONTROL XDM Business Opportunity] class.

### Example 3: Find B2B profiles assigned to opportunities by location {#find-opportunities-location} 

Find all the people who are directly assigned to any opportunities where the account is located in a given location (Canada). This audience requires a link between the [!UICONTROL XDM Individual Profile] class, [!UICONTROL XDM Business Opportunity Person Relation] class, [!UICONTROL XDM Business Opportunity] class, and [!UICONTROL XDM Business Account] class.
