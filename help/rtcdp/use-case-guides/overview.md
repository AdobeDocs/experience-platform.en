# Suggested use cases in Real-Time CDP

Learn about suggested cross-service uses cases to make the most of your Real-Time CDP implementation. This page captures some use-cases made possible by using various Adobe Experience Platform services.

## Partner data support

With third-party cookies set to disappear within the next few years, partner data support can fill the void left by third-party cookie deprecation.

Adobe Real-Time CDP provides extensive support for partner identifiers, allowing you to create audiences of prospects, enrich known audiences with attributes from partners, and much more.

The supported use cases can be divided into customer acquisition and profile enrichment cases. Visit the documentation links below for extensive implementation information.
