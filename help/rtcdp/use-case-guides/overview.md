# Sample use cases in Real-Time CDP

View sample cross-service use cases to make the most of your Real-Time CDP implementation. This page captures some use cases made possible by using various Adobe Experience Platform services.

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>The use cases presented on this page are a subset of the enterprise use cases that you can accomplish with Real-Time CDP. We are working on adding documentation for more sample use cases. In the mean time, reach out to your Adobe representative to explore more use cases in addition to the ones currently documented on the page.

## Partner data support {#partner-data-support}

With third-party cookies set to disappear within the next few years, partner data support can fill the void left by third-party cookie deprecation.

Adobe Real-Time CDP provides extensive support for partner identifiers, allowing you to create audiences of prospects, enrich known audiences with attributes from partners, and much more.

The sample use cases can be grouped into customer acquisition and profile enrichment cases. Visit the documentation links below for extensive implementation information.
