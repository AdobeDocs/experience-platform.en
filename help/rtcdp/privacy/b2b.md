# Privacy in Real-Time CDP B2B Edition

Real-time Customer Data Platform B2B Edition (Real-time CDP B2B Edition) helps marketers bring data from multiple enterprise systems together, allowing them to better identify, understand, and engage their customers. Adobe holds consumer data privacy as a fundamental design principle and provides various controls to help marketers manage the data privacy of their customers.
The majority of Real-time CDP B2B Edition capabilities are powered by Adobe Experience Platform. This document provides information about the various privacy enhancement technologies supported by Real-time CDP B2B Edition, with links to Experience Platform documentation for more information.

## Honoring customer access and delete requests

Legal privacy regulations such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) give customers the right to request access to, or the deletion of, the personal data you collect from them. Since Real-time CDP B2B Edition leverages Experience Platform capabilities for data collection and storage, customer requests to access and delete their personal data should be managed within Platform. See the overview on [Adobe Experience Platform Privacy Service](../../privacy-service/home.md) for more information.

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
> Privacy requests submitted through Adobe Experience Platform Privacy Service for Adobe Marketo Engage apply to Real-time CDP B2B customers only.
