# [!DNL Real-Time Customer Profile] UI guide

[!DNL Real-Time Customer Profile] creates a holistic view of each of your individual customers, combining data from multiple channels including online, offline, CRM, and third-party data. This document serves as a guide for interacting with [!DNL Real-Time Customer Profile] data in the Adobe Experience Platform user interface (UI).

## Getting started

This UI guide requires an understanding of the various [!DNL Experience Platform] services involved with managing [!DNL Real-Time Customer Profiles]. Before reading this guide, or working in the UI, please review the documentation for the following services:

* [[!DNL Real-Time Customer Profile] overview](../home.md): Provides a unified, real-time consumer profile based on aggregated data from multiple sources.
* [[!DNL Identity Service]](../../identity-service/home.md): Enables [!DNL Real-Time Customer Profile] by bridging identities from disparate data sources as they are ingested into [!DNL Experience Platform].
* [[!DNL Experience Data Model (XDM)]](../../xdm/home.md): The standardized framework by which [!DNL Experience Platform] organizes customer experience data.

## [!UICONTROL Overview]

In the Experience Platform UI, select **[!UICONTROL Profiles]** in the left navigation to open the **[!UICONTROL Overview]** tab displaying the profile dashboard. 

>[!NOTE]
>
>If your organization is new to Experience Platform and does not yet have active Profile datasets or merge policies created, the [!UICONTROL Profiles] dashboard is not visible. Instead, the [!UICONTROL Overview] tab displays links and documentation to help you get started with Real-Time Customer Profile.

### Profile dashboard {#profile-dashboard}

The profile dashboard outlines key metrics related to your organization's profile data. 

To learn more, visit the [profile dashboard guide](../../dashboards/guides/profiles.md).

![The Profile dashboard is displayed.](../../dashboards/images/profiles/dashboard-overview.png)

## [!UICONTROL Browse] tab 

On the **[!UICONTROL Browse]** tab you can view your profiles either in a **card** view or a **graph** view by selecting the toggle.

![The card and graph view toggle is highlighted.](../images/user-guide/card-graph-view.png)

Additionally, you can browse your profiles using a merge policy or look up specific profiles using an identity namespace and value.

![The Profiles that belong to the organization are displayed.](../images/user-guide/profile-browse.png)

### Browse by [!UICONTROL Merge policy]

The **[!UICONTROL Browse]** tab is set to the default merge policy for your organization by default. To choose a different merge policy, select the `X` beside the merge policy name and then use the selector to open the **[!UICONTROL Select merge policy]** dialog. 

>[!NOTE]
>
>If there is no merge policy selected, use the selector button next to the **[!UICONTROL Merge policy]** field to open the selection dialog.

![The Merge policy selector is highlighted.](../images/user-guide/browse-by-merge-policy.png)

To choose a merge policy from the **[!UICONTROL Select merge policy]** dialog, select the radio button beside the policy name and then use **[!UICONTROL Select]** to return to the [!UICONTROL Browse] tab. You can then select **[!UICONTROL View]** to refresh the sample profiles and see a sampling of profiles with the new merge policy applied.

![A dialog where you can select the merge policy to filter by is displayed.](../images/user-guide/select-merge-policy.png)

The profiles that are shown represent a sample of up to 20 profiles from your organization's Profile store, after the selected merge policy has been applied. The sample profiles for the selected merge policy are refreshed when new data is added to your organization's Profile store.

To view the details of one of the sample profiles, select the **[!UICONTROL Profile ID]**. For more information, see the section later in this guide on [viewing profile details](#profile-detail).

![Sample profiles that match the merge policy are displayed.](../images/user-guide/profile-browse-table.png)

To learn more about merge policies and their role within Experience Platform, see the [merge policies overview](../merge-policies/overview.md).

### Browse by [!UICONTROL Identity] {#browse-identity}

On the **[!UICONTROL Browse]** tab, you can use an identity namespace in order to look up a specific profile by an identity value. Browsing by an identity requires you to provide a merge policy, an identity namespace, and an identity value.

![The merge policy selector is highlighted.](../images/user-guide/browse-by-merge-policy.png)

If necessary, use the **[!UICONTROL Merge policy]** selector to open the **[!UICONTROL Select merge policy]** dialog and choose the merge policy that you would like to use.

![A dialog where you can select the merge policy to filter by is displayed.](../images/user-guide/select-merge-policy.png)

Then use the **[!UICONTROL Identity namespace]** selector to open the **[!UICONTROL Select identity namespace]** dialog and choose the namespace by which you would like to search. If your organization has many namespaces, you can use the search bar in the dialog to begin typing the name of a namespace. 

You can select a namespace to view additional details or select the radio button to choose a namespace. You can then use **[!UICONTROL Select]** to continue.

![A dialog where you can select the identity namespace to filter by is displayed.](../images/user-guide/select-identity-namespace.png)

After selecting an [!UICONTROL Identity namespace] and returning to the [!UICONTROL Browse] tab, you can enter an **[!UICONTROL Identity value]** related to the namespace that you selected. 

>[!NOTE]
>
>This value is specific to an individual customer profile and must be a valid entry for the namespace provided. For example, selecting the identity namespace "Email" would require an identity value in the form of a valid email address. 

![The identity value that you want to filter by is highlighted.](../images/user-guide/browse-identity.png)

Once a value has been entered, select **[!UICONTROL View]** and a single profile matching the value is returned. Select the **[!UICONTROL Profile ID]** to view a profile.

![The profile that matches the identity value is highlighted.](../images/user-guide/filtered-identity-value.png)

## View profile {#view-profile}

>[!CONTEXTUALHELP]
>id="platform_errors_uplib_201001_404"
>title="Entity not found"
>abstract="This means that Experience Platform could not find the requested entity. To resolve this error, please try one of the following solutions:<ul><li>Ensure the correct profile ID is listed in the URL of the entity you're trying to access.</li><li>Ensure you have the correct Organization and sandbox combination for the entity you're trying to access.</li></ul>"

After selecting a **[!UICONTROL Profile ID]**, the **[!UICONTROL Detail]** tab opens. The profile information displayed on the **[!UICONTROL Detail]** tab has been merged together from multiple profile fragments to form a single view of the individual customer. This includes customer details such as basic attributes, linked identities, and channel preferences. 

Additionally, you can view other details about profiles such as its [attributes](#attributes), [events](#events), and [audience membership](#audience-membership).

### Details tab {#profile-detail}

The **[!UICONTROL Details]** tab provides more detailed information about the selected profile, and is separated into four sections:  Customer profile insights, AI insight widgets, customizable widgets, and auto-classified widgets.

![The profile details page is displayed.](../images/user-guide/profile-details.png)

Additionally, you can toggle whether the AI-generated insights are displayed, show the details for hub compared to edge, as well as view the details in graph view.

![The toggles listed above (AI-generated insights, Hub or Edge data, and Card or Graph view) are highlighted.](../images/user-guide/profile-toggles.png)

#### Customer profile insights {#customer-profile-insights}

The **[!UICONTROL Customer profile insights]** section displays a brief introduction to the profile's attributes. This includes the profile ID, email, phone number, gender, date of birth, as well as the identities and audience memberships of the profile.

![The Customer profile insights section is displayed.](../images/user-guide/customer-profile-insights.png)

#### AI insight widgets {#ai-insight-widgets}

The **[!UICONTROL AI insight widgets]** section displays widgets that are generated by AI. These widgets provide quick insights to the profile, based off of the profile data including demographics (such as age, gender, or location), user behaviors (such as purchase history, website activity, or social media engagement), as well as psychographics (such as interests, preference, or lifestyle choices). All the AI widgets use data that **already** exists in the profile.

![The AI insight widgets section is displayed.](../images/user-guide/ai-insight-widgets.png)

#### Customizable widgets {#customizable-widgets}

The **[!UICONTROL Customizable widgets]** section displays widgets that you can customize to match your business needs. You can group attributes into separate widgets, remove unwanted widgets, or adjust the widgets' layout.

The default fields shown can also be changed at an organizational-level to display preferred Profile attributes. To learn more about customizing these fields, including step-by-step instructions for adding and removing attributes and resizing dashboard panels, please read the [profile detail customization guide](profile-customization.md).

![The customizable widgets section is displayed.](../images/user-guide/customizable-widgets.png)

You can also choose to toggle between viewing the attribute names as their display names and their field path names. To switch between these two displays, select the **[!UICONTROL Show display names]** toggle. 

![The show display names toggle is highlighted.](../images/user-guide/show-display-names.png)

#### Auto-classified widgets {#auto-classified-widgets}

The **[!UICONTROL Auto-classified widgets]** section displays widgets that leverage the union schema to determine the source field groups an attribute belongs to, providing clearer context on where the data originates from. You can use these widgets to explore the structure of your profile's data to better structure your [customizable widgets](#customizable-widgets).

>[!NOTE]
>
>If there are multiple source field groups, the widgets will only use **one** of the available options.

![The auto-classified widgets section is displayed.](../images/user-guide/auto-classified-widgets.png)

### Attributes tab {#attributes}

The **[!UICONTROL Attributes]** tab provides a list view summarizing all of the attributes related to a single profile, after the specified merge policy has been applied.

These attributes can also be viewed as a JSON object by selecting to **[!UICONTROL View JSON]**. This is helpful for any users wishing to better understand how the profile attributes are ingested into Experience Platform.

![The Attributes tab is highlighted. The profile attributes are displayed.](../images/user-guide/attributes.png)

To view the attributes that are available on the Edge, select **[!UICONTROL Edge]** on the data location selector.

![The data location selector within the attributes tab is highlighted.](../images/user-guide/attributes-select.png)

For more information on edge profiles, please read the [edge profiles documentation](../edge-profiles.md).

### Events tab {#events}

The **[!UICONTROL Events]** tab contains data from the 100 most recent ExperienceEvents associated with the customer. This data could include email opens, cart activities, and page views. Selecting **[!UICONTROL View all]** for any individual event provides additional fields and values captures as part of the event.

Events can also be viewed as a JSON object by selecting to **[!UICONTROL View JSON]**. This is helpful for understanding how events are captured in Experience Platform.

![The Events tab is highlighted. The profile events are displayed.](../images/user-guide/events.png)

### Audience membership tab {#audience-membership}

The **[!UICONTROL Audience membership]** tab displays a list with the name and description of audiences to which the individual customer profile currently belongs. This list is updated automatically as the profile qualifies or expires from audiences. The total count of audiences for which the profile is currently qualified is shown on the right-hand side of the tab.

For more information about segmentation in Experience Platform, please refer to the [Adobes Experience Platform Segmentation Service documentation](../../segmentation/home.md).

![The Audience membership tab is highlighted. The profile's audience membership details are displayed.](../images/user-guide/audience-membership.png)
