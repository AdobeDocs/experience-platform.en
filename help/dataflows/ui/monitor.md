# Monitoring dashboard overview

Use the monitoring dashboard in the Adobe Experience Platform UI to view the journey of your data from ingestion to activation. With the monitoring dashboard, you can:

* Monitor the journey of your data from Sources, Identity Service, Real-Time Customer Profile, Audiences, and finally in Destinations.
* View different metrics and statuses depending on the stage that your data is in.
* Filter your data monitoring view by data type.

The monitoring dashboard supports the view of several different data types:

* **Customer & Account**: Customer data refers to the data used in [Real-Time Customer Data Platform](../../rtcdp/home.md), while account data refers to [account profiles data](../../rtcdp/accounts/account-profile-overview.md) that is accessible when subscribed to [Real-Time CDP, B2B Edition](../../rtcdp/b2b-overview.md). If your Real-Time CDP license does not include Real-Time CDP, B2B Edition, then you can only use the monitoring dashboard to monitor customer data.
* **Prospect**: [Prospect profiles](../../profile/ui/prospect-profile.md) are used to represent people who have not yet engaged with your company but you want to reach out to. With prospect profiles, you can supplement your customer profiles with attributes from trusted third-party partners. You must be licensed with Real-Time CDP (App Service), Adobe Experience Platform Activation, Real-Time CDP, Real-Time CDP Prime, Real-Time CDP Ultimate to view the prospect data type.
* **Account profile enrichment**: Account profiles enable you to unify account information from multiple sources. You must be licensed to Real-Time CDP, B2B edition in order monitor account profile enrichment data.

Read this document to learn how to use the monitoring dashboard to monitor the journey of your data across different Experience Platform services.

## Get started

This document requires a working understanding of the following components of Experience Platform:

* [Dataflows](../home.md): Dataflows are representations of data jobs that move data across Experience Platform. You can use the sources workspace to create dataflows that ingest data from a given source to Experience Platform.
* [Sources](../../sources/home.md): Use sources in Experience Platform to ingest data from an Adobe application or a third-party data source.
* [Identity Service](../../identity-service/home.md): Gain a better view of individual customers and their behavior by bridging identities across devices and systems.
* [Real-Time Customer Profile](../../profile/home.md): Provides a unified, real-time consumer profile based on aggregated data from multiple sources.
* [Segmentation](../../segmentation/home.md): Use the Segmentation Service to create segments and audiences from your Real-Time Customer Profile data. 
* [Destinations](../../destinations/home.md): Destinations are pre-built integrations with commonly used applications that allow for the seamless activation of data from Platform for cross-channel marketing campaigns, email campaigns, targeted advertising, and many other use cases.

## Monitoring dashboard guide

In the Experience Platform UI, select **[!UICONTROL Monitoring]** under [!UICONTROL Data Management] in the left navigation.

![The monitoring dashboard in the Experience Platform UI.](../assets/ui/monitor-overview/monitoring.png)

Select **[!UICONTROL Data Type]** and then use the dropdown menu to select the type of data that you want to view. Data types are defined by Experience Data Model (XDM) schema classes to ensure that their data follows a standard format when ingested into Experience Platform. For more information, visit the following documentation:

* [B2B Account data type](../../rtcdp/b2b-tutorial.md)
* [Prospect data type](../../rtcdp/partner-data/prospecting.md)

You can filter your view based on the following data types:

### Configure monitoring time frame {#configure-monitoring-time-frame}

By default, the monitoring dashboard displays metrics on data ingested within the last 24 hours. To update the time frame, select **[!UICONTROL Last 24 hours]**.
