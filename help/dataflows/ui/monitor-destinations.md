# Monitor dataflows for destinations in the UI

Destinations allow you to activate your data from Adobe Experience Platform to countless external partners. Platform makes the process of tracking the flow of data to your destinations easier by providing transparency with dataflows.

The monitoring dashboard provides you with a visual representation of the journey of a dataflow, including the destination the data is activated to. This tutorial provides instructions on how you can either monitor dataflows directly in the destinations workspace or use the monitoring dashboard to monitor dataflows for your destinations using the Experience Platform user interface.

## Getting started {#getting-started}

This guide requires a working understanding of the following components of Adobe Experience Platform:

- [Dataflows](../home.md): Dataflows are a representation of data jobs that move data across Platform. Dataflows are configured across different services, helping move data from source connectors to target datasets, to [!DNL Identity] and [!DNL Profile], and to [!DNL Destinations].
    - [Dataflow runs](../../sources/notifications.md): Dataflow runs are the recurring scheduled jobs based on the frequency configuration of selected dataflows.
- [Destinations](../../destinations/home.md): Destinations are pre-built integrations with commonly used applications that allow for the seamless activation of data from Platform for cross-channel marketing campaigns, email campaigns, targeted advertising, and many other use cases.
- [Sandboxes](../../sandboxes/home.md): [!DNL Experience Platform] provides virtual sandboxes which partition a single [!DNL Platform] instance into separate virtual environments to help develop and evolve digital experience applications.

## Monitor dataflows in the Destinations workspace {#monitor-dataflows-in-the-destinations-workspace}

In the **[!UICONTROL Destinations]** workspace within the Platform UI, navigate to the **[!UICONTROL Browse]** tab and select the name of a destination that you want to view.

![Select destination view](../assets/ui/monitor-destinations/select-destination.png)

A list of existing dataflows appears. On this page is a list of viewable dataflows, including information about their destination, username, number of dataflows, and status.

See the following table for more information on statuses:

| Status | Description |
| ------ | ----------- |
| Enabled | The `Enabled` status indicates that a dataflow is active and is exporting data according to the schedule it was provided. |
| Disabled | The `Disabled` status indicates that a dataflow is inactive and is not exporting any data. |
| Processing | The `Processing` status indicates that a dataflow is not yet active. This status is often encountered immediately after a new dataflow is created. |
| Error | The `Error` status indicates that the activation process of a dataflow has been disrupted. |

### Dataflow runs for streaming destinations {#dataflow-runs-for-streaming-destinations}

>title="Identities failed"
>abstract="The count of individual profile identities which failed for the selected destination. Please check error diagnostics for details."

For streaming destinations, the [!UICONTROL Dataflow runs] tab provides an hourly update for metric data on your dataflow runs. The most prominent statistics labelled are for identities.

Identities represent the different facets of a profile. For example, if a profile contains both a phone number and an email address, that profile will have two identities.

A list of individual runs and their particular metrics is displayed, along with the following totals for identities:

- **[!UICONTROL Identities activated]**: The total number of profile identities successfully activated to the selected destination. This metric includes identities that are created, updated, and removed from exported segments.
- **[!UICONTROL Identities excluded]**:  The total number of profile identities that are skipped for activation based on missing attributes and consent violation.
- **[!UICONTROL Identities failed]**: The total number of profile identities that are not activated to the destination due to errors.

![Dataflow runs details for streaming destinations](../assets/ui/monitor-destinations/dataflow-runs-stream.png)

Each individual dataflow run shows the following details:

- **[!UICONTROL Dataflow run start]**: The time that the dataflow run started at. For streaming dataflow runs, Experience Platform captures metrics based on the start of the dataflow run, in the form of hourly metrics. For streaming dataflow runs, if a dataflow run started for example at 10:30PM, the metric shows the start time as 10:00 PM in the UI.
- **[!UICONTROL Processing time]**: The amount of time that it took for the dataflow run to process.
  - For **[!UICONTROL completed]** runs, the processing time metric always shows one hour.
  - For dataflow runs which are still in a **[!UICONTROL processing]** state, the window to capture all the metrics stays open for more than an hour, to process all metrics that correspond to the dataflow run. For example, a dataflow run that started at 9:30 AM might stay in a processing state for one hour and thirty minutes to capture and process all the metrics. Then, once the processing window closes and the status of the dataflow run updates to **completed**, the displayed processing time is changed to one hour.
- **[!UICONTROL Profiles received]**: The total number of profiles received in the dataflow.
- **[!UICONTROL Identities activated]**: The total number of profile identities that were successfully activated to the selected destination as part of the dataflow run. This metric includes identities that are created, updated, and removed from exported segments.
- **[!UICONTROL Identities excluded]**: The total number of profile identities that are excluded from activation based on missing attributes and consent violation.
- **[!UICONTROL Identities failed]** The total number of profile identities that are not activated to the destination due to errors.
- **[!UICONTROL Activation rate]**: The percentage of received identities that have either been successfully activated or skipped. The following formula demonstrates how this value is calculated:
![Activation rate formula](../assets/ui/monitor-destinations/activation-rate-formula.png)
- **[!UICONTROL Status]**: Represents the state the dataflow is in: either [!UICONTROL Completed] or [!UICONTROL Processing]. [!UICONTROL Completed] means that all the identities for the corresponding dataflow run were exported within the one-hour period. [!UICONTROL Processing] means that the dataflow run has not yet finished.

To view the details of a particular dataflow run, select the run's start time from the list. 

The details page for a dataflow run contains additional information such as the number of profiles received, the number of identities activated, the number of identities failed, and the number of identities excluded.

![Dataflow details for streaming destinations](../assets/ui/monitor-destinations/dataflow-details-stream.png)

The details page also displays a list of identities that failed and identities that were excluded. Information for both the failed and excluded identities is displayed, including the error code, identity count, and description. By default, the list displays the failed identities. To show skipped identities, select the **[!UICONTROL Identities excluded]** toggle.

>abstract="The count of individual profile records excluded from activation for the selected destination based on missing attributes and consent violation."

For batch destinations, the [!UICONTROL Dataflow runs] tab provides metric data on your dataflow runs. A list of individual runs and their particular metrics is displayed, along with the following totals for identities:

- **[!UICONTROL Identities activated]**: The total number of profile identities successfully activated to the selected destination. This metric includes identities that are created, updated, and removed from exported segments.
- **[!UICONTROL Identities excluded]**: The count of individual profile identities excluded from activation for the selected destination, based on missing attributes and consent violation.

![Dataflow runs view for batch destinations](../assets/ui/monitor-destinations/dataflow-runs-batch.png)

Each individual dataflow run shows the following details:

- **[!UICONTROL Dataflow run start]**: The time that the dataflow run started at.
- **[!UICONTROL Segment]**: The name of the segment associated with each dataflow run.
- **[!UICONTROL Processing time]**: The amount of time it took for the dataflow run to be processed.
- **[!UICONTROL Profiles received]**: The total number of profiles received in the dataflow. This value is updated every 60 minutes.
- **[!UICONTROL Identities activated]**: The total number of profile identities that were successfully activated to the selected destination as part of the dataflow run. This metric includes identities that are created, updated, and removed from exported segments.
- **[!UICONTROL Identities excluded]**: The total number of profile identities that are excluded from activation based on missing attributes and consent violation.
- **[!UICONTROL Status]**: Represents the state the dataflow is in. This can be one of three states: [!UICONTROL Success], [!UICONTROL Failed], and [!UICONTROL Processing]. [!UICONTROL Success] means that the dataflow is active and is exporting data according to its provided schedule. [!UICONTROL Failed] means that the activation of data has been suspended due to errors. [!UICONTROL Processing] means that the dataflow is not yet active and is generally encountered when a new dataflow is created.

To view details of a specific dataflow run, select the run's start time from the list.

>[!NOTE]
>
>Dataflow runs are generated based on the destination dataflow's schedule frequency. A separate dataflow run is made for each [merge policy](../../profile/merge-policies/overview.md) applied to a segment.

The details page for a dataflow, in addition to the details shown on the dataflows list, displays more specific information about the dataflow:

- **[!UICONTROL Size of data]**: The size of the dataflow that is being exported.
- **[!UICONTROL Total files]**: The total number of files exported in the dataflow.
- **[!UICONTROL Last updated]**: The time the dataflow run was last updated.

![Dataflow run details for batch destinations](../assets/ui/monitor-destinations/dataflow-batch.png)

The details page also displays a list of identities that failed and identities that were excluded. Information for both the failed and excluded identities is displayed, including the error code and description. By default, the list displays the failed identities. To show excluded identities, select the **[!UICONTROL Identities excluded]** toggle.

![Dataflow records for batch destinations](../assets/ui/monitor-destinations/dataflow-records-batch.png)

## Monitoring Destinations dashboard {#monitoring-destinations-dashboard}

>[!NOTE]
>
>- Destinations monitoring functionality is currently supported for all destinations in Experience Platform *except* the [Adobe Target](/help/destinations/catalog/personalization/adobe-target-connection.md) and [Custom personalization](/help/destinations/catalog/personalization/custom-personalization.md) destinations.
>- For the [Amazon Kinesis](/help/destinations/catalog/cloud-storage/amazon-kinesis.md), [Azure Event Hubs](/help/destinations/catalog/cloud-storage/azure-event-hubs.md), and [HTTP API](/help/destinations/catalog/streaming/http-destination.md) destinations, the metrics related to identities excluded, failed, and activated are estimated. Higher volumes of activation data lead to higher accuracy of the metrics.

>[!CONTEXTUALHELP]
>id="platform_monitoring_activation"
>title="Activation"
>abstract="The destination activation view contains information on the segment's activation status and metrics taken from Real-Time Customer Profile to generate unique identities."

To access the [!UICONTROL Monitoring] dashboard, select **[!UICONTROL Monitoring]** (![monitoring icon](../assets/ui/monitor-destinations/monitoring-icon.png)) in the left navigation. Once on the [!UICONTROL Monitoring] page, select [!UICONTROL Destinations]. The [!UICONTROL Monitoring] dashboard contains metrics and information on the destination run jobs.

Use the [!UICONTROL Destinations] dashboard to get an overall idea of the health of your activation flows. Start by getting insights on an aggregated level for all batch and streaming destinations and then drill down into detailed views for dataflows, dataflow runs, and activated segments for an in-depth look at your activation data. The screens in the [!UICONTROL Monitoring] dashboard provide actionable insights through metrics and error descriptions to help you troubleshoot any problems that might arise in your activation scenarios.

At the center of the dashboard is the [!UICONTROL Activation] panel, which contains metrics and graphs that display data on the activation rate of the data which is exported to streaming destinations, as well as on the failed batch dataflow runs to batch destinations.

![Streaming and batch activation graphs](../assets/ui/monitor-destinations/dashboard-graph.png)


By default, the data displayed contains the activation information from the last 24 hours. Select **[!UICONTROL Last 24 hours]** to adjust the time frame of records displayed. Available options include **[!UICONTROL Last 24 hours]**, **[!UICONTROL Last 7 days]**, and **[!UICONTROL Last 30 days]**. Alternatively, you can select the dates on the calendar pop-up window that appears. Once you have selected dates, select **[!UICONTROL Apply]** to adjust the time frame of the information shown.

>[!NOTE]
>
>The following screenshot shows the activation rate and batch dataflow runs for the last 30 days instead of the last 24 hours. You can adjust the time frame by selecting **[!UICONTROL Last 30 days]**.

![Change lookback date range for activated destinations](../assets/ui/monitor-destinations/dashboard-graph-change-date-range.png)

Use the arrow icon (![arrow icon](/help/dataflows/assets/ui/monitor-destinations/chevron-up.png)) to expand or dismiss the cards at the top of the screen, which show at-a-glance information about the activation details, based on the destination type - streaming or batch:

- **[!UICONTROL Streaming activation rate]**: Represents the percentage of received identities that have either been successfully activated or skipped. The formula used to calculate this percentage is described further above on this page, in the [Dataflow runs for streaming destinations](#dataflow-runs-for-streaming-destinations) section.
- **[!UICONTROL Batch failed dataflow runs]**: Represents the number of failed dataflow runs in the selected time interval.

![Show or dismiss cards at top of page](../assets/ui/monitor-destinations/monitoring-destinations-toggle-arrow.gif)

The **[!UICONTROL Activation]** graph is displayed by default and you can disable it to expand the list of destinations below. Select the **[!UICONTROL Metrics and graphs]** toggle to disable the graphs.

The **[!UICONTROL Activation]** panel displays a list of destinations that contain at least one existing account. This list also includes information on the profiles received, identities activated, identities failed, identities excluded, activation rate, total failed dataflows, and the last updated date for these destinations. Not all metrics are available for all destination types. The table below outlines which metrics are available per destination type, streaming or batch.

| Metric | Destination type |
---------|----------|
| **[!UICONTROL Profiles received]** | Streaming and batch |
| **[!UICONTROL Identities activated]** | Streaming and batch |
| **[!UICONTROL Identities failed]** | Streaming |
| **[!UICONTROL Identities excluded]** | Streaming and batch |
| **[!UICONTROL Activation rate]** | Streaming |
| **[!UICONTROL Total failed dataflows]** | Batch |
| **[!UICONTROL Last updated]** | Streaming and batch |

![Dashboard all activated destinations](../assets/ui/monitor-destinations/dashboard-destinations.png)

You can also filter your list of destinations to only display the selected category of destinations. Select the **[!UICONTROL My destinations]** dropdown, and select the [destination category](/help/destinations/destination-types.md#categories) that you want to filter to.

![Filter destinations using dropdown selector](../assets/ui/monitor-destinations/dashboard-destinations-filter-dropdown.png)

Additionally, you can enter a destination into the search bar to isolate to a single destination. If you want to see the destination's dataflows you can select the filter ![filter](../assets/ui/monitor-destinations/filter-add.png) beside it to see a list of its active dataflows.

![Filter destinations using search bar](../assets/ui/monitor-destinations/filtered-destinations.png)

If you want to view all existing dataflows across all destinations, select **[!UICONTROL Dataflows]**.

A list of dataflows appears, sorted by the last dataflow run. You can see additional details for a specific dataflow by locating the destination you want to monitor, selecting the filter ![filter](../assets/ui/monitor-destinations/filter-add.png) beside it, and then subsequently selecting the filter ![filter](../assets/ui/monitor-destinations/filter-add.png) beside the dataflow you want more information about.

![All dataflows highlighted in the monitoring dashboard](../assets/ui/monitor-destinations/dashboard-dataflows.png)

Once you select a dataflow for further inspection, the dataflow details page contains a toggle which allows you to see the activated data in the dataflow, broken down by dataflow runs or segments.

### Dataflow runs view {#dataflow-runs-view}

When **[!UICONTROL Dataflow runs]** is selected, you can see a list of dataflow runs for the selected dataflow and further information about each run.

>[!INFO]
>
>For dataflows to streaming destinations, a dataflow run is broken down into hourly windows. Each hourly window generates a corresponding dataflow run ID.
>
>For dataflows to batch destinations, each segment has a corresponding dataflow run generated, based on the segment activation scheduled frequency. For example, if you set up a daily scheduled activation for five segments in the same destination dataflow, there will be five separate dataflow runs generated every day.

![Flow runs panel](../assets/ui/monitor-destinations/dashboard-flow-runs-view.png)

Use the **[!UICONTROL Show failures only]** toggle to display only the failed runs for a dataflow.

![Dataflow runs - show failures only toggle](../assets/ui/monitor-destinations/dataflow-runs-show-failures-only.gif)

### Segment-level view {#segment-level-view}

When **[!UICONTROL Segments]** is selected, you see a list of the segments which were activated to the selected dataflow, within the selected time range. This screen includes segment-level information about the identities activated, identities excluded, as well as the status and the time of the last dataflow run. By reviewing the metrics for identities excluded and activated, you can verify if a segment has been successfully activated or not.

For example, you are activating a segment called "Loyalty Members in California" to an Amazon S3 destination "Loyalty Members California December". Let's assume that there are 100 profiles in the selected segment but only 80 out of 100 profiles contain Loyalty ID attributes and you have defined the export mapping rules as `loyalty.id` is required. In this case, on a segment level, you will see 80 identities activated, and 20 identities excluded.

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>Note the current limitations related to segment-level metrics:
>- The segment-level view is currently only available for batch destinations.
>- Segment level metrics are currently recorded for successful dataflow runs only. They are not recorded for failed dataflow runs and excluded records.

![Segments in dataflow panel](../assets/ui/monitor-destinations/dashboard-segments-view.png)

In the segment-level view, the metrics are aggregated across multiple dataflow runs within the selected time range. If there are multiple dataflow runs, you can drill down from the segment level to see the breakdown for each dataflow run, filtered by the selected segment.
Use the filter button ![filter](../assets/ui/monitor-destinations/filter-add.png) to drill down into the dataflow runs view for each segment in the dataflow.

### Dataflow runs page {#dataflow-runs-page}

The dataflow runs page displays information on your dataflow runs, including the dataflow run start time, processing time, profiles received, identities activated, identities excluded, identities failed, activation rate, and status.

When you drill down into the dataflow runs page from the [segment-level view](#segment-level-view), you have the option of filtering the dataflow runs by the following options:

- **[!UICONTROL Dataflow runs with failed identities]**: For the selected segment, this option lists all the dataflow runs that failed for activation. To inspect why identities in a certain dataflow run failed, see the [dataflow run details page](#dataflow-run-details-page) for that dataflow run.
- **[!UICONTROL Dataflow runs with skipped identities]**: For the selected segment, this option lists all the dataflow runs where some of the identities were not fully activated and some profiles were skipped. To inspect why identities in a certain dataflow run were skipped, see the [dataflow run details page](#dataflow-run-details-page) for that dataflow run.
- **[!UICONTROL Dataflow runs with activated identities]**: For the selected segment, this option lists all the dataflow runs that have identities which were successfully activated.

![Filtering dataflow runs for segments](/help/dataflows/assets/ui/monitor-destinations/dataflow-runs-segment-filter.png)

To see more details about a specific dataflow run, select the filter ![filter](../assets/ui/monitor-destinations/filter-add.png) beside the dataflow run start time to see the dataflow run details page.

![Dataflow runs filter in monitoring dashboard](../assets/ui/monitor-destinations/dataflow-runs-filter.png)

### Dataflow run details page {#dataflow-run-details-page}

The dataflow run details page, in addition to the details shown on the dataflow runs list, displays more specific information about the dataflow:

- **[!UICONTROL Dataflow run ID]**: The ID of the dataflow.
- **[!UICONTROL IMS org ID]**: The organization the dataflow belongs to.
- **[!UICONTROL Last updated]**: The time the dataflow run was last updated.

The details page also has a toggle to switch between dataflow run errors and segments. This option is only available for dataflow runs in batch destinations.

The dataflow run errors view displays a list of identities that failed and identities that were excluded. Information for both the failed and excluded identities is displayed, including the error code, identity count, and description. By default, the list displays the failed identities. To show skipped identities, select the **[!UICONTROL Identities excluded]** toggle.

![Identities excluded toggle](../assets/ui/monitor-destinations/identities-excluded.png)

When **[!UICONTROL Segments]** is selected, you see a list of the segments which were activated in the selected dataflow run. This screen includes segment-level information about the identities activated, identities excluded, as well as the status and the time of the last dataflow run.

![Dataflow run - segments view](../assets/ui/monitor-destinations/dataflow-run-segments-view.png)

## Next steps {#next-steps}

By following this guide, you now know how to monitor dataflows for both batch and streaming destinations, including all the relevant information such as processing time, activation rate, and status. To learn more about dataflows in Platform, please read the [dataflows overview](../home.md). To learn more about destinations, please read the [destinations overview](../../destinations/home.md).
