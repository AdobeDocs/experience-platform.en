# Monitor streaming audiences

intro blurb

## Get started

This guide requires a working understanding of the following components of Experience Platform:

* [Dataflows](../home.md): Dataflows represent data jobs that transfer information across Experience Platform. They are configured across various services to facilitate the movement of data from source connectors to target datasets, as well as to Identity Service, Real-Time Customer Profile, and Destinations.
* [Segmentation Service](../../segmentation/home.md): 
* [Capacities](../../landing/license-usage-and-guardrails/capacity.md): In Experience Platform, capacities let you know if your organization has exceeded any of your guardrails and gives you information on how to fix these issues.

## Monitoring metrics for streaming audiences {#streaming-audience-metrics}
