# Monitor dataflows for segments in the UI

Segmentation Service allows you to create segments and audiences from your Real-time Customer Profile data in Adobe Experience Platform. Platform provides dataflows to transparently track this flow of data from sources to destinations.

The monitoring dashboard provides you with a visual representation of the journey of a dataflow, including the status of your data's segmentation. This tutorial provides instructions on how you can use the monitoring dashboard to monitor your data's segmentation using the Experience Platform user interface.

## Getting started {#getting-started}

This guide requires a working understanding of the following components of Adobe Experience Platform:

- [Dataflows](../home.md): Dataflows are a representation of data jobs that move data across Platform. Dataflows are configured across different services, helping move data from source connectors to target datasets, to [!DNL Identity] and [!DNL Profile], and to [!DNL Destinations].
  - [Dataflow runs](../../sources/notifications.md): Dataflow runs are the recurring scheduled jobs based on the frequency configuration of selected dataflows.
- [Segmentation](../../segmentation/home.md): Segmentation allows you to create segments and audiences from your Real-time Customer Profile data. 
- [Sandboxes](../../sandboxes/home.md): [!DNL Experience Platform] provides virtual sandboxes which partition a single [!DNL Platform] instance into separate virtual environments to help develop and evolve digital experience applications.
