# Dataflows overview

In Adobe Experience Platform, data is ingested from a wide variety of sources, analyzed within Experience Platform, and activated to a wide variety of destinations. Platform makes the process of tracking this potentially non-linear flow of data easier by providing transparency with dataflows. 

Dataflows are a representation of data jobs that move this data across Platform, and are configured across different services, from source connectors to target datasets, to Identity and Profile Service, and to destinations. 

## Monitoring dataflows

Monitoring dataflows can be done by using either the Platform APIs or Platform UI. To learn how to monitor dataflows using the API, please read the [monitoring dataflows API tutorial](./api/monitor.md). To learn how to monitor dataflows within the Platform UI, please read either the [monitoring dataflows for sources tutorial](./ui/monitor-sources.md) or the [monitoring dataflows for destinations tutorial](./ui/monitor-destinations.md).
