**Append save strategy**: The "append" save strategy is an option used when specifying third-party data to ingest via a connection and appending any new data or rows at the end of the dataset. The previously ingested rows remain untouched and only rows created since the last scheduled run are ingested to Experience Platform. Any rows that were changed in the source system remain unchanged on Experience Platform.

**Array**: Arrays are used for ordered elements with the same data type.

**Artificial intelligence**: Artificial intelligence is a theory and development of computer systems that are able to perform tasks that normally require human intelligence, such as visual perception, speech recognition, decision-making, and translation between languages.

**Attributes**: Attributes are specified characteristics that represent a profile.

**Attribute merge**: When defining a merge policy using the Real-Time Customer Profile API, the `attributeMerge` object indicates the manner by which the merge policy will prioritize profile attributes in the case of data conflicts. It is equivalent to selecting a [!UICONTROL Merge method] when defining a merge policy in the Platform UI.

Interest-based targeting, or personalization, occurs if the following three conditions are met: The data collected on-site is used to make inferences about a user's interest; is used in another context such as on another site or app; and is used to select which content or ads are served based on those inferences.

**C6 contract label**: A `C6` contract data usage label specifies that data cannot be used for on-site ad targeting. On-site ad targeting includes the selection and delivery of advertisements on your organization's websites, or apps or to measure the delivery and effectiveness of such advertisements. This includes using previously collected on-site data about the users' interest to select ads, process data about what advertisements were shown, when and where they were shown, and whether the users took any action related to the advertisement, such as selecting an ad or making a purchase.

**C7 contract label**: A `C7` contract data usage label specifies that data cannot be used for on-site targeting of content. On-site content targeting includes the selection and delivery of content on your organization's websites, or apps or to measure the delivery and effectiveness of such content. This includes previously collected information about users' interest to select content, processing data about what content was shown, how often or how long it was shown, when and where it was shown, and whether the uses took any actions related to the content, including for example selecting content.

**C8 contract label**: A `C8` contract data usage label specifies that data cannot be used for measurement of your organization's websites or apps. This does not include interest-based targeting, which is the collection of information about your use of this service to subsequently personalize content and/or advertising in other contexts.

**C9 contract label**: A `C9` contract data usage label specifies that data cannot be used in data-science workflows. Some contracts include explicit prohibitions on data used for data science. Sometimes these are phrased in terms that prohibit the use of data for artificial intelligence (AI), machine-learning (ML), or modeling.

**C10 contract label**: A `C10` contract data usage label specifies that data cannot be used for stitched identity activation. Some data usage policies restrict the use of stitched identity data for personalization. The `C10` label is automatically applied to segments if their merge policies use the "private graph" option.

**Created Date column**: Selecting a Created Date column is an option when specifying third-party data via a source connection. When the append save strategy is selected and the dataset schema contains a multiple date fields, you must choose from the available schema to specify a Created Date key column. The Created Date option is not available when the overwrite save strategy is selected.

**Create Table as Select**: Create Table as Select (CTAS) is a SQL command which, when executed as a part of a complete and valid SQL query, will instruct [!DNL Query Service] to persist the results of the query in a dataset. You can create a new result set, overwrite previous results, or append to previous results.
