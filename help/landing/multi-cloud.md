# Adobe Experience Platform multi-cloud overview

Adobe Experience Platform is available in two versions, running on different cloud platforms: [[!DNL Microsoft Azure]](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us) and [[!DNL Amazon Web Services (AWS)]](https://aws.amazon.com/). This flexibility allows you to choose the best fit for your business and technical requirements.

This page provides a high-level overview of the two versions and includes guidance on how to choose the right version for your business.

## Differences between Microsoft Azure and AWS versions

The table below highlights the major differences between the Microsoft Azure and AWS versions of Experience Platform.

| Feature / Functionality | Microsoft Azure | Amazon Web Services |

## Which cloud is right for me?

Choosing between Experience Platform on Azure or AWS depends on several factors specific to your business:

* **Business and technical needs**: Assess your organization's requirements and long-term cloud strategy.
* **Existing infrastructure**: Consider your current cloud infrastructure and integration needs.
* **Cloud technology reliance**: If your business relies heavily on Microsoft technologies, Azure might be the better fit. If you rely more on Amazon services, AWS could be the better option.
