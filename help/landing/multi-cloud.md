## Which cloud is right for me?

How do we help a customer decide what to choose?

The choice between running Experience Cloud on Azure or AWS depends on multiple factors specific to your business: your organization's business and technical needs, your long-term cloud integration strategy, and your existing infrastructure.

If your business relies heavily on Microsoft cloud technology, then choosing Experience Platform on Microsoft Azure might be the better fit.

Similarly, if you rely more on Amazon services, then AWS might be the better option.



## Feature parity {#feature-parity}

Adobe is constantly working to offer feature parity for all applications running on Experience Platform, such as [Real-Time Customer Data Platform](../rtcdp/home.md), [Adobe Journey Optimizer](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/journey-optimizer/using/ajo-home), and [Customer Journey Analytics](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/analytics-platform/using/cja-landing).

Experience Platform functionalities which are not supported on both Microsoft Azure and AWS versions are clearly called out in the product documentation.
