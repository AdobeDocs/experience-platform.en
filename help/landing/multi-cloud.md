## Feature parity {#feature-parity}

Adobe is constantly working to offer feature parity for all applications running on Experience Platform, such as [Real-Time Customer Data Platform](../rtcdp/home.md), [Adobe Journey Optimizer](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/journey-optimizer/using/ajo-home), and [Customer Journey Analytics](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/analytics-platform/using/cja-landing).

Experience Platform functionalities which are not supported on both Microsoft Azure and AWS versions are clearly called out in the product documentation.
