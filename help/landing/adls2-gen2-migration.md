# Adobe Experience Platform Data Lake migration to Gen2

Adobe Experience Platform is migrating to Gen2 Data Lake. This is a new generation of data lake which provides Platform users benefits such as geo-region replication, finer role-based access controls (RBAC), and better scaling.

## User impact

While Adobe is migrating the Data Lake from Gen1 to Gen 2, users will be able to **read** from the Data Lake, but all capabilities that **write** into the Data Lake will be impacted. Below is a list of impacted capabilities:

- **Sources**: Data coming in from the sources and various data ingestion workflows will be delayed. Users will see their data once the migration is complete.
- **Query Service**: Users can perform queries but will not be able to write the output of the query into a dataset.
- **Real-Time Customer Profile**: Data ingested to the Profile store through **batch** ingestion will not be available during the migration. However, data ingested through **streaming** ingestion will be available during the migration. Additionally, Profile exports won't be available during the migration.
- **Data Science Workspace**: Writes from Data Science Workspace will fail.
- **Segmentation Service**: Audiences derived from **batch** segmentation cannot be activated during the migration. Audiences derived from **streaming** segmentation will not be affected.
- **Customer Journey Analytics**: Customer Journey Analytics reports data may be out of date and will not refresh during the migration, as batches are not being ingested into Data Lake.

## Communication to Platform users

Adobe will be contacting System Administrators to discuss the impact of the migration in detail and to confirm the migration dates and times for specific organizations.
