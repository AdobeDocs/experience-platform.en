# Use the self-identification survey to build your Experience Platform personal profile

>[!NOTE]
>
>The self-identification survey is in beta. Its features and documentation are subject to change.

The self-identification survey is a short questionnaire presented in the Adobe Experience Platform UI home page. You can fill out the survey to provide information on your job functions and general objectives. This information is then used to better align in-product guides and eventually deliver content that is more relevant to your objectives.

This document provides information on how you can use the self-identification survey in the Platform UI to receive relevant content based on your goals and tasks, as well as how to reconfigure your personal profile attributes using the UI.

To learn more about Adobe Experience Platform, please read the [Experience Platform overview](home.md).
