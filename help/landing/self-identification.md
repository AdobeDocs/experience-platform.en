# Use the self-identification survey to build your Experience Cloud personal profile

The self-identification survey is a short questionnaire presented in the Adobe Experience Platform UI home page. Use the survey to provide information on your job functions and general objectives. This information is then used to better align in-product guides and eventually deliver content that is more relevant to your objectives.

This document provides information on how you can use the self-identification survey in Platform UI to receive relevant content based on your goals and tasks. This document also provides information on how to reconfigure your personal profile attributes using the UI.
