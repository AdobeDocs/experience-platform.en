Currently, Capacity supports the following services:

- Streaming segmentation
- Streaming ingestion

Within these services, the following guardrails are tracked:

- The maximum number of streaming audiences is 500
  - Of these 500 streaming audiences, the maximum number of edge audiences is 150
- The initial combined throughput for streaming ingestion is 1500 records per second (rps)
  - This combined streaming throughput measures the combined peak inbound events per second for streaming ingestion into Profile Service across your production and development sandboxes.
  - You can purchase additional streaming segmentation support of up to 13,500 records per second. More information about purchasing additional entitlements can be found in the [Real-Time CDP product description](https://helpx.adobe.com/legal/product-descriptions/real-time-customer-data-platform-b2c-edition-prime-and-ultimate-packages.html).

The audience capacity is at a **sandbox** level. This means that, for every sandbox you have in your organization, you can have 500 streaming audiences, of which 150 of those can be edge audiences.

The streaming throughput capacity is at an **organization** level and can be distributed to your individual sandboxes. For example, with the 1500 rps for streaming ingestion throughput, you can set your production sandbox to be at 1300 rps and your development sandbox to be at 200 rps.

Experience Platform calculates the sandbox's throughput in 15 minute rolling intervals. This throughput is measured in real-time, with the data refreshing every 60 seconds.

If your usage reaches 80% and 90% of your licensed capacity, Experience Platform will issue an alert, notifying that you are reaching the maximum of your specified capacity. You can modify the settings to customize the capacity percentage to receive the alert or remove the alert entirely.

If your usage goes to above 100% of your licensed capacity, you will be considered in breach of your capacity. At this point, you will experience performance latency, and your service level targets (SLTs) will **not** be guaranteed.

## Streaming throughput best practices {#suggestions}

You can resolve your streaming throughput violations by adopting one of the following recommendations:

1. Increase the allocated capacity for the sandbox.
2. Identify high throughput dataflows in the [monitoring dashboard](/help/dataflows/ui/monitor-streaming-profile.md) and apply throttling or filtering against these dataflows if needed.
3. Optimize your ingestion by using batch ingestion for lower latency use cases.

Additionally, you can look at your dataflows and see if you can optimize your data strategy.

| Contributing factor | What it is | Impact to use cases | Best practices |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Batch to streaming conversion | Batch workloads converted to streaming can significantly increase throughput, affecting performance and resource allocation. For example, performing a bulk profile update after an event without rate limits. | Streaming strategies are unnecessary for batch use cases when low-latency processing isn't required. | Evaluate use case requirements. For batch outbound marketing, consider using [batch ingestion](/help/ingestion/batch-ingestion/overview.md) instead of streaming to manage data ingestion more efficiently.  |
| Unnecessary data ingestion | Ingesting data not required for personalization increases throughput without adding value, wasting resources. For example, ingesting all analytics traffic into profiles regardless of relevance.| Excess non-relevant data creates noise, making it harder to identify impactful data points. It can also cause friction when defining and managing audiences and profiles. | Ingest only data that is required for your use cases. Ensure that you filter out unnecessary data.<ul><li>**Adobe Analytics**: Use [row-level filtering](/help/sources/tutorials/ui/create/adobe-applications/analytics.md#filtering-for-real-time-customer-profile) to optimize your data intake.</li><li>**Sources**: Use the [[!DNL Flow Service] API to filter row-level data](/help/sources/tutorials/api/filter.md) for supported sources like [!DNL Snowflake] and [!DNL Google BigQuery].</li></li>**Edge datastream**: Configure [dynamic datastreams](/help/datastreams/configure-dynamic-datastream.md) to perform row-level filtering of traffic coming in from WebSDK.</li></ul> |

## Frequently asked questions {#faq}

The following section outlines frequently asked questions about the capabilities of Capacity.

### Can I have a maximum combined throughput limit that sums up to less than my target maximum?

+++ Answer

No. The maximum combined throughput limit **must** sum up to your organization's guardrail. 

+++

### What happens if I exceed my maximum capacities?

+++ Answer

This depends on which capacity is exceeded. 

Currently, if you exceed the maximum number of allowed audiences, your excessive audiences will not be affected. However, the ability to create new audiences may be restricted in the future.

If you exceed your streaming throughput, you will experience performance latency in your ingestion and segmentation. 

+++

### Why should I adhere to my maximum capacities?

+++ Answer

Working within your maximum capacities ensures your data remains consistent and keeps your data integrity intact.

You ensure consistent performance during peak events, avoiding technical issues that could adversely affect system performance and impact your downstream customer experiences, ultimately improving your data hygiene and overall system performance.

+++

### What are best practices to manage streaming ingestion throughput?

+++ Answer

To best manage your streaming ingestion throughput, you should evaluate your datasets to ensure they are prioritizing data necessary for personalization. 


If real-time processing is not required, you should use batch ingestion instead of streaming ingestion.
