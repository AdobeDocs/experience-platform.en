# Data usage labels in the Dataset Service API

Separate from the Catalog Service API, the [!DNL Dataset Service] API provides endpoints to manage data usage labels for datasets. For steps on how to make calls to these endpoints, please refer to the guide on [managing data usage labels using the API](../../data-governance/labels/dataset-api.md) in the Adobe Experience Platform Data Governance documentation.
