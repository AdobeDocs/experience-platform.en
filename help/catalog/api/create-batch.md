# Create a batch

In order for a dataset to ingest data, it must have a batch associated with it. Using the `id` value of an existing dataset, you can create a batch by making a POST request to the `/batches` endpoint in the [!DNL Catalog] API.

**API format**

```HTTP
POST /batches
```

**Request**

```SHELL
curl -X POST 'https://platform.adobe.io/data/foundation/import/batches' \
  -H 'accept: application/json' \
  -H 'x-gw-ims-org-id: {ORG_ID}' \
  -H 'x-sandbox-name: {SANDBOX_NAME}' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer {ACCESS_TOKEN}' \
  -H 'x-api-key: {API_KEY}' \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  -d '{
        "datasetId":"5c8c3c555033b814b69f947f"
      }'
```

| Property | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `datasetId` | The `id` of the dataset the batch will be associated with. |

**Response**

A successful response returns HTTP Status 201 (Created) and a response object containing details of the newly created batch, including its `id`, a read-only, system generated string.
