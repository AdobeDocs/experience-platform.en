# [!DNL Catalog Service] API guide

[!DNL Catalog Service] is the system of record for data location and lineage within Adobe Experience Platform. [!DNL Catalog] acts as a metadata store or "catalog" where you can find information about your data within [!DNL Experience Platform], without needing to access the data itself. See the [[!DNL Catalog] overview](../home.md) for more information.

This developer guide provides steps to help you start using the [!DNL Catalog] API. The guide then provides sample API calls for performing key operations using [!DNL Catalog].

## Prerequisites

[!DNL Catalog] tracks metadata for several kinds of resources and operations within [!DNL Experience Platform]. This developer guide requires a working understanding of the various [!DNL Experience Platform] services involved with creating and managing these resources:

* [[!DNL Experience Data Model (XDM)]](../../xdm/home.md): The standardized framework by which [!DNL Platform] organizes customer experience data.
* [Batch ingestion](../../ingestion/batch-ingestion/overview.md): How [!DNL Experience Platform] ingests and stores data from data files, such as CSV and Parquet.
* [Streaming ingestion](../../ingestion/streaming-ingestion/overview.md): How [!DNL Experience Platform] ingests and stores data from client- and server-side devices in real time.

The following sections provide additional information that you will need to know or have on-hand in order to successfully make calls to the [!DNL Catalog Service] API.

## Reading sample API calls

This guide provides example API calls to demonstrate how to format your requests. These include paths, required headers, and properly formatted request payloads. Sample JSON returned in API responses is also provided. For information on the conventions used in documentation for sample API calls, see the section on [how to read example API calls](../../landing/troubleshooting.md#how-do-i-format-an-api-request) in the [!DNL Experience Platform] troubleshooting guide.

## Gather values for required headers

In order to make calls to [!DNL Platform] APIs, you must first complete the [authentication tutorial](https://www.adobe.com/go/platform-api-authentication-en). Completing the authentication tutorial provides the values for each of the required headers in all [!DNL Experience Platform] API calls, as shown below:

* Authorization: Bearer `{ACCESS_TOKEN}`
* x-api-key: `{API_KEY}`
* x-gw-ims-org-id: `{ORG_ID}`

All resources in [!DNL Experience Platform] are isolated to specific virtual sandboxes. All requests to [!DNL Platform] APIs require a header that specifies the name of the sandbox the operation will take place in:

* x-sandbox-name: `{SANDBOX_NAME}`

>[!NOTE]
>
>For more information on sandboxes in [!DNL Platform], see the [sandbox overview documentation](../../sandboxes/home.md). 

All requests that contain a payload (POST, PUT, PATCH) require an additional header:

* Content-Type: application/json

## Best practices for [!DNL Catalog] API calls

When performing GET requests to the [!DNL Catalog] API, best practice is to include query parameters in your requests in order to return only the objects and properties that you need. Unfiltered requests can cause response payloads to reach past 3GB in size, which can slow overall performance.

You can view specific objects by including their ID in the request path or use query parameters such as `properties` and `limit` to filter responses. Filters can be passed as headers and as query parameters, with those passed as query parameters taking precedence. See the document on [filtering Catalog data](filter-data.md) for more information.

Since some queries can put a heavy load on the API, global limits have been implemented on [!DNL Catalog] queries to further support best practices.

## Next steps

This document covered the prerequisite knowledge required to make calls to the [!DNL Catalog] API. You can now proceed to the sample calls provided in this developer guide and follow along with their instructions.

Most of the examples in this guide use the `/dataSets` endpoint, but the principles can be applied to other endpoints within [!DNL Catalog] (such as `/batches`). See the [Catalog Service API reference](https://www.adobe.io/experience-platform-apis/references/catalog/) for a complete list of all calls and operations available for each endpoint.

For a step-by-step workflow that demonstrates how the [!DNL Catalog] API is involved with data ingestion, see the tutorial on [creating a dataset](../datasets/create.md).
