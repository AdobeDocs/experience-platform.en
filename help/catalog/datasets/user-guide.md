# Datasets UI guide

This user guide provides instructions on performing common actions when working with datasets within Adobe Experience Platform user interface.

## Getting started

This user guide requires a working understanding of the following components of Adobe Experience Platform:

* [Datasets](overview.md): The storage and management construct for data persistence in [!DNL Experience Platform].
* [[!DNL Experience Data Model (XDM) System]](../../xdm/home.md): The standardized framework by which [!DNL Experience Platform] organizes customer experience data.
    * [Basics of schema composition](../../xdm/schema/composition.md): Learn about the basic building blocks of XDM schemas, including key principles and best practices in schema composition.
    * [Schema Editor](../../xdm/tutorials/create-schema-ui.md): Learn how to build your own custom XDM schemas using the [!DNL Schema Editor] within the [!DNL Experience Platform] user interface.
* [[!DNL Real-Time Customer Profile]](../../profile/home.md): Provides a unified, real-time consumer profile based on aggregated data from multiple sources.
* [[!DNL Adobe Experience Platform Data Governance]](../../data-governance/home.md): Ensure compliancy with regulations, restrictions, and policies regarding the usage of customer data.

In the [!DNL Experience Platform] UI, select **[!UICONTROL Datasets]** in the left-navigation to open the **[!UICONTROL Datasets]** dashboard. The dashboard lists all available datasets for your organization. Details are displayed for each listed dataset, including its name, the schema the dataset adheres to, and the status of the most recent ingestion run.

![The Experience Platform UI with the Datasets item highlighted in the left navigation bar.](../images/datasets/user-guide/browse-datasets.png)

Select the name of a dataset from the [!UICONTROL Browse] tab to access its **[!UICONTROL Dataset activity]** screen and see details of the dataset you selected. The activity tab includes a graph visualizing the rate of messages being consumed as well as a list of successful and failed batches.

![Metrics and visualizations of your selected dataset are highlighted.](../images/datasets/user-guide/dataset-activity-1.png)
![The sample batches that relate to your selected dataset are highlighted.](../images/datasets/user-guide/dataset-activity-2.png)

## More actions {#more-actions}

You can [!UICONTROL Delete] or [!UICONTROL Enable a dataset for Profile] from the [!UICONTROL Dataset] details view. To see the available actions, select **[!UICONTROL ... More]** in the top right of the UI. The drop-down menu appears. 

![The Datasets workspace with the [!UICONTROL ... More] dropdown menu highlighted.](../images/datasets/user-guide/more-actions.png)

If you select **[!UICONTROL Enable a dataset for Profile]**, a confirmation dialog appears. Select **[!UICONTROL Enable]** to confirm your choice.

>[!NOTE]
>
>To enable a dataset for Profile, the schema that the dataset adheres to must be compatible for use in Real-Time Customer Profile. See the [Enable a dataset for profile](#enable-profile) section for more information.

![The Enable dataset confirmation dialog.](../images/datasets/user-guide/profile-enable-confirmation-dialog.png)

If you select **[!UICONTROL Delete]**, the [!UICONTROL Delete dataset] confirmation dialog appears. Select **[!UICONTROL Delete]** to confirm your choice.

>[!NOTE]
>
>You cannot delete system datasets.

You can also delete a dataset or add a dataset for use with Real-Time Customer Profile from the inline actions found on the [!UICONTROL Browse] tab. See the [inline actions section](#inline-actions) for more information.

![The Delete dataset confirmation dialog.](../images/datasets/user-guide/delete-confirmation-dialog.png)

## Inline dataset actions {#inline-actions}

The datasets UI now offers a collections of inline actions for each available dataset. Select the ellipsis (...) of a dataset that you want to manage to see the available options in a pop-up menu. The available actions include; 

* [[!UICONTROL Preview dataset]](#preview)
* [[!UICONTROL Manage data and access labels]](#manage-and-enforce-data-governance)
* [[!UICONTROL Enable unified profile]](#enable-profile)
* [[!UICONTROL Manage tags]](#manage-tags)
* [[!UICONTROL Set data retention policy]](#data-retention-policy)
* [[!UICONTROL Move to folders]](#move-to-folders)
* [[!UICONTROL Delete]](#delete). 

More information on these available actions can be found in their respective sections. To learn how to manage large numbers of datasets simultaneously, refer to the [bulk actions](#bulk-actions) section.

### Preview a dataset {#preview}

You can preview dataset sample data from both the inline options of the [!UICONTROL Browse] tab and also the [!UICONTROL Dataset activity] view. From the [!UICONTROL Browse] tab, select the ellipses (...) next to the dataset name you wish to preview. A menu list of options appears. Next, select **[!UICONTROL Preview dataset]** from the list of available options. If the dataset is empty, the preview link is deactivated and instead indicates that the preview is not available.

![The Browse tab of the Datasets workspace with the ellipsis and Preview dataset option highlighted for the chosen dataset.](../images/datasets/user-guide/preview-dataset-option.png)

This opens the preview window, where the hierarchical view of the schema for the dataset is shown on the right.

>[!NOTE]
>
>The schema diagram on the left side of the view only displays fields that contain data. Fields without data are automatically hidden to streamline the UI and focus on relevant information.

![The dataset preview dialog with information about the structure, as well as sample values, for the dataset are shown.](../images/datasets/user-guide/preview-dataset.png)

Alternatively, from the **[!UICONTROL Dataset activity]** screen, select **[!UICONTROL Preview dataset]** near the top-right corner of your screen to preview up to 100 rows of data. 

![The Preview dataset button is highlighted.](../images/datasets/user-guide/select-preview.png)

For more robust methods to access your data, [!DNL Experience Platform] provides downstream services such as [!DNL Query Service] and [!DNL JupyterLab] to explore and analyze data. See the following documents for more information:

* [Query Service overview](../../query-service/home.md)
* [JupyterLab user guide](../../data-science-workspace/jupyterlab/overview.md)

### Manage and enforce data governance on a dataset {#manage-and-enforce-data-governance}

You can manage the data governance labels for a dataset by selecting the inline options of the [!UICONTROL Browse] tab. Select the ellipses (...) next to the dataset name that you wish to manage, followed by **[!UICONTROL Manage data and access labels]** from the dropdown menu.

Data usage labels, applied at the schema level, allow you to categorize datasets and fields according to usage policies that apply to that data. See the [Data Governance overview](../../data-governance/home.md) to learn more about labels, or refer to the [data usage labels user guide](../../data-governance/labels/overview.md) for instructions on how to apply labels to schemas for propagation to datasets.

## Enable a dataset for Real-Time Customer Profile {#enable-profile}

Every dataset has the ability to enrich customer profiles with its ingested data. To do so, the schema that the dataset adheres to must be compatible for use in [!DNL Real-Time Customer Profile]. A compatible schema satisfies the following requirements:

* The schema has at least one attribute specified as an identity property.
* The schema has an identity property defined as the primary identity.

For more information on enabling a schema for [!DNL Profile], see the [Schema Editor user guide](../../xdm/tutorials/create-schema-ui.md).

You can enable a dataset for Profile from both the inline options of the [!UICONTROL Browse] tab and also the [!UICONTROL Dataset activity] view. From the [!UICONTROL Browse] tab of the [!UICONTROL Datasets] workspace, select the ellipsis of a dataset that you want to enable for Profile. A menu list of options appears. Next, select **[!UICONTROL Enable unified profile]** from the list of available options.

![The Browse tab of the Datasets workspace with the ellipses and Enable unified profile highlighted.](../images/datasets/user-guide/enable-for-profile.png)

Alternatively, from the dataset's **[!UICONTROL Dataset activity]** screen, select the **[!UICONTROL Profile]** toggle within the **[!UICONTROL Properties]** column. Once enabled, data that is ingested into the dataset will also be used to populate customer profiles.

>[!NOTE]
>
>If a dataset already contains data and is then enabled for [!DNL Profile], the existing data is not automatically consumed by [!DNL Profile]. After a dataset is enabled for [!DNL Profile], it is recommended that you re-ingest any existing data to have it contribute to customer profiles.

![The Profile toggle is highlighted within the dataset details page.](../images/datasets/user-guide/enable-dataset-profiles.png)

Datasets that have been enabled for Profile can also be filtered on this criteria. See the section on how to [filter Profile enabled datasets](#filter-profile-enabled-datasets) for more information.

### Manage dataset tags {#manage-tags}

Add custom created tags to organize datasets and improve search, filtering, and sorting capabilities. From the [!UICONTROL Browse] tab of the [!UICONTROL Datasets] workspace, select the ellipsis of a dataset that you want to manage followed by **[!UICONTROL Manage tags]** from the dropdown menu.

![The Browse tab of the Datasets workspace with the ellipsis and Manage tags option highlighted for the chosen dataset.](../images/datasets/user-guide/manage-tags.png)

The [!UICONTROL Manage tags] dialog appears. Enter a short description to create a custom tag, or choose from a pre-existing tag to label your dataset. Select **[!UICONTROL Save]** to confirm your settings.

![The Manage tags dialog with custom tags highlighted.](../images/datasets/user-guide/manage-tags-dialog.png)

The [!UICONTROL Manage tags] dialog can also remove existing tags from a dataset. Simply select the 'x' next to the tag that you wish to remove and select **[!UICONTROL Save]**. 

Once a tag has been added to a dataset, the datasets can be filtered based on the corresponding tag. See the section on how to [filter datasets by tags](#enable-profile) for more information.

For more information on how to classify business objects for easier discovery and categorization, see the guide on [managing metadata taxonomies](../../administrative-tags/ui/managing-tags.md). This guide explains how users with the right permissions can create pre-defined tags, assign them to categories, and manage all related CRUD operations in the Experience Platform UI.

### Set data retention policy {#data-retention-policy}

Manage dataset expiration and retention settings using the inline action menu from the [!UICONTROL Browse] tab of the [!UICONTROL Datasets] workspace. You can use this feature to configure how long data is retained in the data lake and Profile store. The expiration date is based on when data was ingested into Experience Platform and your configured retention period.

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>To apply or update retention rules for an ExperienceEvent dataset, your user role must include the **Manage datasets** permission. This role-based access control ensures that only authorized users can modify dataset retention settings.
>
>See the [Access control overview](../../access-control/home.md#platform-permissions) for more information on assigning permissions in Adobe Experience Platform.

>[!TIP]
>
>The data lake stores raw, unprocessed data, such as event logs, clickstream data, and bulk-ingested records, for analytics and processing. The Profile store contains customer-identifiable data, including identity-stitched events and attribute information, to support real-time personalization and activation.

To configure your retention period, select the ellipsis next to the dataset followed by **[!UICONTROL Set data retention policy]** from the dropdown menu.

![The Browse tab of the Datasets workspace with the ellipsis and Set data retention policy option highlighted.](../images/datasets/user-guide/set-data-retention-policy-dropdown.png)

The [!UICONTROL Set dataset retention] dialog appears. The dialog displays sandbox-level license usage metrics, dataset-level details, and current data retention settings. These metrics show your usage compared to your entitlements and help you assess dataset-specific storage and retention configurations. The metrics include dataset name, type, Profile enablement status, and data lake and Profile store usage.

>[!NOTE]
>
>Sandbox-level licensed data lake storage metrics are still in development and may not appear. A full breakdown of your license usage metrics can be found on the License Usage dashboard. See the documentation for descriptions of these metrics.
<!-- replace this screenshot with a dataset that enabled unified profile so user can see the Profile TTL settings -->
![The Set dataset retention dialog.](../images/datasets/user-guide/set-data-retention-dialog.png)

Configure your preferred retention period in the data retention settings dialog. Enter a number and select a time unit (days, months, or years) from the dropdown menu. You can configure separate retention settings for the data lake and Profile Service.

>[!NOTE] 
> 
>The minimum retention period for the data lake is 30 days. The minimum retention period for Profile Service is one day.

To support transparency and monitoring, timestamps are provided for the **last** and **next** data retention job executions. The timestamps help you understand when the last data cleanup occurred and when the next one is scheduled.

#### Storage impact insights {#storage-impact-insights}

To open a visual forecast of the storage impact of different retention policies, select **[!UICONTROL View Experience Event Data distribution]**.

The chart displays the distribution of experience events across various retention periods for the currently selected dataset. Hover over each bar to see the precise number of records that will be removed if the selected retention period is applied.

You can use the visual forecast to evaluate the impact of different retention periods and make informed business decisions. For example, if you select a 30-day retention period and the chart shows that 60% of your data will be deleted, you may choose to extend retention to preserve more data for analysis.

>[!NOTE]
>
>The Experience Event distribution chart is specific to the selected dataset and reflects only its data. It applies exclusively to data stored in the data lake.

![The Set data retention dialog with the Experience Event distribution chart displayed.](../images/datasets/user-guide/visual-forecast.png)

When you are satisfied with your configuration, select **[!UICONTROL Save]** to confirm your settings.

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>Once data retention rules are applied, any data older than the number of days defined by the expiration value is permanently deleted and cannot be recovered.

After configuring your retention settings, use the Monitoring UI to confirm that your changes were executed by the system. The Monitoring UI provides a centralized view of data retention activity across all datasets. From there, you can track job execution, review how much data was deleted, and ensure that your retention policies are functioning as expected. 

To explore how retention policies apply across different services, see the dedicated guides on [Experience Event Dataset Retention in Profile](../../profile/event-expirations.md) and [Experience Event Dataset Retention in the Data Lake](./experience-event-dataset-retention-ttl-guide.md). This visibility supports governance, compliance, and efficient data lifecycle management.

To learn how to use the monitoring dashboard to track source dataflows in the Experience Platform UI, see the [Monitor dataflows for sources in the UI](../../dataflows/ui/monitor-sources.md) documentation.

<!-- Improve the link above. I cannot link to a 100% appropriate document yet. -->

For more information on the rules that define dataset expirations date ranges and best practices for configuring your data retention policy, see the [frequently asked questions page](../catalog-faq.md).

#### Enhanced visibility of retention periods and storage metrics {#retention-and-storage-metrics}

Four new columns provide greater visibility into your data management: **[!UICONTROL Data Lake Storage]**, **[!UICONTROL Data Lake Retention]**, **[!UICONTROL Profile Storage]**, and **[!UICONTROL Profile Retention]**. These metrics show how much storage your data consumes and its retention period in both data lake and Profile Service.

This increased visibility empowers you to make informed decisions and manage storage costs more effectively. Sort datasets by storage size to identify the largest ones in your current sandbox. These insights support data management best practices and help ensure compliance with your licensed entitlements.

![The Browse tab of the Datasets workspace with the four new storage and retention columns highlighted.](../images/datasets/user-guide/storage-and-retention-columns.png)

The following table provides an overview of the new retention and storage metrics. It details each column's purpose and how it supports managing data retention and storage.

| Column title  | Description |
|---|---|
| [!UICONTROL Data Lake Retention] | The current retention period for each dataset in the data lake. This value is configurable and determines how long data is retained before deletion. |
| [!UICONTROL Data Lake Storage] | The current storage usage for each dataset in the data lake. Use this metric to manage storage limits and optimize usage. |
| [!UICONTROL Profile Storage] | The current storage usage for each dataset within the Profile Service. Helps monitor storage consumption and support data management decisions. |
| [!UICONTROL Profile Retention] | The current retention period for Profile datasets. You can update this value to control how long Profile data is retained. |

{style="table-layout:auto"}

To act on the insights from storage and retention metrics, refer to the [data management license entitlement best practices guide](../../landing/license-usage-and-guardrails/data-management-best-practices.md). Use it to manage what data you ingest and retain, apply filters and expiration rules, and control data growth to stay within your licensed usage limits.

### Move to folders {#move-to-folders}

You can place datasets within folders for better dataset management. To move a dataset into a folder, select the ellipses (...) next to the dataset name you wish to manage, followed by **[!UICONTROL Move to folder]** from the dropdown menu.

![The [!UICONTROL Datasets] dashboard with the ellipses and [!UICONTROL Move to folder] highlighted.](../images/datasets/user-guide/move-to-folder.png)

The [!UICONTROL Move] dataset to folder dialog appears. Select the folder you want to move the audience to, then select **[!UICONTROL Move]**. A popup notification informs you that the dataset move has been successful.

![The [!UICONTROL Move] dataset dialog with [!UICONTROL Move] highlighted.](../images/datasets/user-guide/move-dialog.png)

>[!TIP]
>
>You can also create folders directly from the Move dataset dialog. To create a folder, select the create folder icon (![The create folder icon.](/help/images/icons/folder-add.png)) in the top right of the dialog.
>
>![The [!UICONTROL Move] dataset dialog with the create folder icon highlighted.](/help/catalog/images/datasets/user-guide/create-folder.png)

Once the dataset is in a folder, you can choose to only display datasets that belong to a specific folder. To open your folder structure, select the show folders icon (![The show folders icon](/help/images/icons/rail-left.png)). Next, select your chosen folder to see all associated datasets.

![The [!UICONTROL Datasets] dashboards with the datasets folder structure displayed, the show folders icon, and a selected folder highlighted.](../images/datasets/user-guide/folder-structure.png)

### Delete a dataset {#delete}

You can delete a dataset from either the dataset inline actions in the [!UICONTROL Browse] tab or the top right of the [!UICONTROL Dataset activity] view. From the [!UICONTROL Browse] view, select the ellipses (...) next to the dataset name you wish to delete. A menu list of options appears. Next, select **[!UICONTROL Delete]** from the dropdown menu.

![The Browse tab of the Datasets workspace with the ellipsis and the Delete option highlighted for the chosen dataset.](../images/datasets/user-guide/inline-delete-dataset.png)

A confirmation dialog appears. Select **[!UICONTROL Delete]** to confirm.

Alternatively, select **[!UICONTROL Delete dataset]** from the **[!UICONTROL Dataset activity]** screen. 

>[!NOTE]
>
>Datasets created and utilized by Adobe applications and services (such as Adobe Analytics, Adobe Audience Manager, or [!DNL Offer Decisioning]) cannot be deleted.

![The Delete dataset button is highlighted within the dataset details page.](../images/datasets/user-guide/delete-dataset.png)

A confirmation box appears. Select **[!UICONTROL Delete]** to confirm the deletion of the dataset.

![The confirmation modal for deletion is displayed, with the Delete button highlighted.](../images/datasets/user-guide/confirm-delete.png)

### Delete a Profile-enabled dataset

If a dataset is enabled for Profile, deleting that dataset through the UI will delete it from the data lake, Identity Service, and also any profile data associated with that dataset in the Profile store.

You can delete profile data associated with a dataset from the [!DNL Profile] store (leaving the data in the data lake) using the Real-Time Customer Profile API. For more information, see the [profile system jobs API endpoint guide](../../profile/api/profile-system-jobs.md).

## Search and filter datasets {#search-and-filter}

To search or filter the list of available datasets, select the filter icon (![The filter icon.](/help/images/icons/filter.png)) at the top left of the workspace. A set of filter options in the left rail appears. There are several methods to filter your available datasets. These include: [[!UICONTROL Show System Datasets]](#show-system-datasets), [[!UICONTROL Included in profile]](#filter-profile-enabled-datasets), [[!UICONTROL Tags]](#filter-by-tag), [[!UICONTROL Creation date]](#filter-by-creation-date), [[!UICONTROL Modified date], [!UICONTROL Created by]](#filter-by-creation-date), and [[!UICONTROL Schema]](#filter-by-schema).

The list of applied filters is displayed above the filtered results.

![The Browse tab of the Datasets workspace with the list of applied filters highlighted.](../images/datasets/user-guide/applied-filters.png)

### Show system datasets {#show-system-datasets}

By default, only datasets that you have ingested data into are shown. If you want to see the system-generated datasets, select the **[!UICONTROL Yes]** checkbox in the [!UICONTROL Show system datasets] section. System-generated datasets are only used to process other components. For example, the system-generated profile export dataset is used to process the profile dashboard.

![The filter options of the Datasets workspace with the [!UICONTROL Show system datasets] section highlighted.](../images/datasets/user-guide/show-system-datasets.png)

### Filter Profile enabled datasets {#filter-profile-enabled-datasets}

The datasets that have been enabled for Profile data are used to populate customer profiles after data has been ingested. See the section on [enabling datasets for Profile](#enable-profile) to learn more. 

To filter your dataset based on whether they have been enabled for Profile, select the [!UICONTROL Yes] check box from the filter options.

![The filter options of the Datasets workspace with the [!UICONTROL Included in Profile] section highlighted.](../images/datasets/user-guide/included-in-profile.png)

### Filter datasets by tag {#filter-by-tag}

![The filter options of the Datasets workspace with the [!UICONTROL Tags] input and filter icon highlighted.](../images/datasets/user-guide/filter-tags.png) 

### Filter datasets by creation date {#filter-by-creation-date}

Datasets can be filtered by creation date over a custom time period. This can be used to exclude historic data or to generate specific chronological data insights and reporting. Choose a [!UICONTROL Start date] and an [!UICONTROL End date] by selecting the calendar icon for each field. After which, only datasets that conform to that criteria will appear in the Browse tab.

### Filter datasets by modified date {#filter-by-modified-date}

Similar to the filter for creation date, you can filter your datasets based on the date they were last modified. In the [!UICONTROL Modified date] section, Choose a [!UICONTROL Start date] and an [!UICONTROL End date] by selecting the calendar icon for each field. After which, only datasets that were modified during that period will appear in the Browse tab.

### Filter by schema {#filter-by-schema}

You can filter datasets based on the schema that defines their structure. Either select the dropdown icon or input the schema name into the text field. A list of potential matches appears. Select the appropriate schema from the list.

## Bulk actions {#bulk-actions}

Use bulk actions to enhance your operational efficiency and perform multiple actions on numerous datasets simultaneously. You can save time and maintain an organized data structure with bulk actions such as [Move to folder](#move-to-folders), [Edit tags](#manage-tags), and [Delete](#delete) datasets. 

To act on more than one dataset at a time, select individual datasets with the checkbox on each row, or select an entire page with the column header checkbox. Once selected, the bulk action bar appears. 

![The Datasets Browse tab with numerous datasets selected and the bulk action bar highlighted.](../images/datasets/user-guide/bulk-actions.png)

When you apply bulk actions to datasets, the following conditions apply:

* You can select datasets from different pages of the UI.
* If you select a filter, the selected datasets will reset.

## Sort datasets by created date {#sort}

Datasets in the [!UICONTROL Browse] tab can be sorted by either ascending or descending dates. Select the [!UICONTROL Created] or [!UICONTROL Last updated] column headings to alternate between ascending and descending. Once selected, the column indicates this with either an up or down arrow to the side of the column header.

![The Browse tab of the Datasets workspace with the Created and Last updated column highlighted.](../images/datasets/user-guide/ascending-descending-columns.png)

## Create a dataset {#create}

To create a new dataset, start by selecting **[!UICONTROL Create dataset]** in the **[!UICONTROL Datasets]** dashboard.

![The Create dataset button is highlighted.](../images/datasets/user-guide/select-create.png)

In the next screen, you are presented with the following two options for creating a new dataset:

![The Add data screen is displayed. The location where you can upload the CSV file for the dataset is highlighted.](../images/datasets/user-guide/add-csv-data.png)

## Monitor data ingestion

In the [!DNL Experience Platform] UI, select **[!UICONTROL Monitoring]** in the left-navigation. The **[!UICONTROL Monitoring]** dashboard lets you view the statuses of inbound data from either batch or streaming ingestion. To view the statuses of individual batches, select either **[!UICONTROL Batch end-to-end]** or **[!UICONTROL Streaming end-to-end]**. The dashboards list all batch or streaming ingestion runs, including those that are successful, failed, or still in progress. Each listing provides details of the batch, including the batch ID, the name of the target dataset, and the number of records ingested. If the target dataset is enabled for [!DNL Profile], the number of ingested identity and profile records is also displayed.

![The monitoring batch end-to-end screen is shown. Both monitoring and batch-to-batch are highlighted.](../images/datasets/user-guide/batch-listing.png)

You can select on an individual **[!UICONTROL Batch ID]** to access the **[!UICONTROL Batch overview]** dashboard and see details for the batch, including error logs should the batch fail to ingest.

![Details of the selected batch are displayed. This includes the number of records ingested, the number of records failed, the batch status, the file size, the ingestion start and end times, the dataset and batch IDs, the organization ID, the dataset name, and the access information.](../images/datasets/user-guide/batch-overview.png)

If you wish to delete the batch, select **[!UICONTROL Delete batch]** near the top right of the dashboard. Deleting a batch also removes its records from the dataset that the batch was originally ingested to.

>[!NOTE]
>
>If the ingested data has been enabled for Profile and processed, then deleting a batch does not delete that data from the Profile store.

![The Delete batch button is highlighted on the dataset details page.](../images/datasets/user-guide/delete-batch.png)
