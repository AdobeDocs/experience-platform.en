# Datasets UI guide

This user guide provides instructions on performing common actions when working with datasets within Adobe Experience Platform user interface.

## Getting started

This user guide requires a working understanding of the following components of Adobe Experience Platform:

*   [Datasets](overview.md): The storage and management construct for data persistence in [!DNL Experience Platform].
*   [[!DNL Experience Data Model (XDM) System]](../../xdm/home.md): The standardized framework by which [!DNL Experience Platform] organizes customer experience data.
    *   [Basics of schema composition](../../xdm/schema/composition.md): Learn about the basic building blocks of XDM schemas, including key principles and best practices in schema composition.
    *   [Schema Editor](../../xdm/tutorials/create-schema-ui.md): Learn how to build your own custom XDM schemas using the [!DNL Schema Editor] within the [!DNL Platform] user interface.
*   [[!DNL Real-Time Customer Profile]](../../profile/home.md): Provides a unified, real-time consumer profile based on aggregated data from multiple sources.
*   [[!DNL Adobe Experience Platform Data Governance]](../../data-governance/home.md): Ensure compliancy with regulations, restrictions, and policies regarding the usage of customer data.

## View datasets {#view-datasets}

>id="platform_datasets_negative_numbers"
>title="Negative numbers in dataset activity"
>abstract="Negative numbers in ingested records means that a user has deleted certain batches in a selected time range."
>text="Learn more in documentation"

In the [!DNL Experience Platform] UI, select **[!UICONTROL Datasets]** in the left-navigation to open the **[!UICONTROL Datasets]** dashboard. The dashboard lists all available datasets for your organization. Details are displayed for each listed dataset, including its name, the schema the dataset adheres to, and status of the most recent ingestion run.

![An image that highlights the Datasets item within the left navigation bar.](../images/datasets/user-guide/browse-datasets.png)

By default, only the datasets that you have ingested into are shown. If you want to see the system-generated datasets, enable the **[!UICONTROL Show system datasets]** toggle. System-generated datasets are only used to process other components. For example, the system-generated profile export dataset is used to process the profile dashboard.

![The toggle that lets you choose whether or not system datasets should be displayed is highlighted.](../images/datasets/user-guide/system-datasets.png)

Select the name of a dataset to access its **[!UICONTROL Dataset activity]** screen and see details of the dataset you selected. The activity tab includes a graph visualizing the rate of messages being consumed as well as a list of successful and failed batches.

![Details of your selected dataset are highlighted.](../images/datasets/user-guide/dataset-activity-1.png)
![Sample batches that belong to your selected dataset are highlighted.](../images/datasets/user-guide/dataset-activity-2.png)

## Preview a dataset

From the **[!UICONTROL Dataset activity]** screen, select **[!UICONTROL Preview dataset]** near the top-right corner of your screen to preview up to 100 rows of data. If the dataset is empty, the preview link will be deactivated and will instead say that the preview is not available.

![The Preview dataset button is highlighted.](../images/datasets/user-guide/select-preview.png)

In the preview window, the hierarchical view of the schema for the dataset is shown on the right.

![A preview of the dataset is displayed. Information about the structure, as well as sample values, are shown.](../images/datasets/user-guide/preview-dataset.png)

For more robust methods to access your data, [!DNL Experience Platform] provides downstream services such as [!DNL Query Service] and [!DNL JupyterLab] to explore and analyze data. See the following documents for more information:

*   [Query Service overview](../../query-service/home.md)
*   [JupyterLab user guide](../../data-science-workspace/jupyterlab/overview.md)

## Create a dataset {#create}

To create a new dataset, start by selecting **[!UICONTROL Create dataset]** in the **[!UICONTROL Datasets]** dashboard.

![The Create dataset button is highlighted.](../images/datasets/user-guide/select-create.png)

In the next screen, you are presented with the following two options for creating a new dataset:

*   [Create dataset from schema](#schema)
*   [Create dataset from CSV file](#csv)

### Create a dataset with an existing schema {#schema}

In the **[!UICONTROL Create dataset]** screen, select **[!UICONTROL Create dataset from schema]** to create a new empty dataset.

![The Create dataset from schema button is highlighted.](../images/datasets/user-guide/create-dataset-schema.png)

The **[!UICONTROL Select schema]** step appears. Browse the schema listing and select the schema that the dataset will adhere to before selecting **[!UICONTROL Next]**.

![A list of schemas is shown. The schema that will be used to create the dataset is highlighted.](../images/datasets/user-guide/select-schema.png)

The **[!UICONTROL Configure dataset]** step appears. Provide the dataset with a name and optional description, then select **[!UICONTROL Finish]** to create the dataset.

![Configuration details of the dataset are inserted. This includes details such as the dataset name and description.](../images/datasets/user-guide/configure-dataset-schema.png)

### Create a dataset with a CSV file {#csv}

When a dataset is created using a CSV file, an ad hoc schema is created to provide the dataset with a structure that matches the provided CSV file. In the **[!UICONTROL Create dataset]** screen, select **[!UICONTROL Create dataset from CSV file]**.

![The Create dataset from CSV file button is highlighted.](../images/datasets/user-guide/create-dataset-csv.png)

The **[!UICONTROL Configure]** step appears. Provide the dataset with a name and optional description, then select **[!UICONTROL Next]**.

![Configuration details of the dataset are inserted. This includes details such as the dataset name and description.](../images/datasets/user-guide/configure-dataset-csv.png)

The **[!UICONTROL Add data]** step appears. Upload the CSV file by either dragging and dropping it onto the center of your screen, or select **[!UICONTROL Browse]** to explore your file directory. The file can be up to ten gigabytes in size. Once the CSV file is uploaded, select **[!UICONTROL Save]** to create the dataset.

>[!NOTE]
>
>CSV column names must start with alphanumeric characters, and can contain only letters, numbers, and underscores.

![The Add data screen is displayed. The location where you can upload the CSV file for the dataset is highlighted.](../images/datasets/user-guide/add-csv-data.png)

## Enable a dataset for Real-Time Customer Profile {#enable-profile}

Every dataset has the ability to enrich customer profiles with its ingested data. To do so, the schema that the dataset adheres to must be compatible for use in [!DNL Real-Time Customer Profile]. A compatible schema satisfies the following requirements:

*   The schema has at least one attribute specified as an identity property.
*   The schema has an identity property defined as the primary identity.

For more information on enabling a schema for [!DNL Profile], see the [Schema Editor user guide](../../xdm/tutorials/create-schema-ui.md).

To enable a dataset for Profile, access its **[!UICONTROL Dataset activity]** screen and select the **[!UICONTROL Profile]** toggle within the **[!UICONTROL Properties]** column. Once enabled, data that is ingested into the dataset will also be used to populate customer profiles.

>[!NOTE]
>
>If a dataset already contains data and is then enabled for [!DNL Profile], the existing data is not automatically consumed by [!DNL Profile]. After a dataset is enabled for [!DNL Profile], it is recommended that you re-ingest any existing data to have it contribute to customer profiles.

![The Profile toggle is highlighted within the dataset details page.](../images/datasets/user-guide/enable-dataset-profiles.png)

## Manage and enforce data governance on a dataset {#manage-and-enforce-data-governance}

Data usage labels, applied at the schema level, allow you to categorize datasets and fields according to usage policies that apply to that data. See the [Data Governance overview](../../data-governance/home.md) to learn more about labels, or refer to the [data usage labels user guide](../../data-governance/labels/overview.md) for instructions on how to apply labels to schemas for propagation to datasets.

## Delete a dataset {#delete}

You can delete a dataset by first accessing its **[!UICONTROL Dataset activity]** screen. Then, select **[!UICONTROL Delete dataset]** to delete it. 

>[!NOTE]
>
>Datasets created and utilized by Adobe applications and services (such as Adobe Analytics, Adobe Audience Manager, or [!DNL Offer Decisioning]) cannot be deleted.

![The Delete dataset button is highlighted within the dataset details page.](../images/datasets/user-guide/delete-dataset.png)

A confirmation box appears. Select **[!UICONTROL Delete]** to confirm the deletion of the dataset.

![The confirmation modal for deletion is displayed, with the Delete button highlighted.](../images/datasets/user-guide/confirm-delete.png)

## Delete a Profile-enabled dataset

If a dataset is enabled for Profile, deleting that dataset through the UI will delete it from data lake, Identity Service, and the Profile store within Platform.

You can delete a dataset from the [!DNL Profile] store only (leaving the data in the Data Lake) using the Real-Time Customer Profile API. For more information, see the [profile system jobs API endpoint guide](../../profile/api/profile-system-jobs.md).

## Monitor data ingestion

In the [!DNL Experience Platform] UI, select **[!UICONTROL Monitoring]** in the left-navigation. The **[!UICONTROL Monitoring]** dashboard lets you view the statuses of inbound data from either batch or streaming ingestion. To view the statuses of individual batches, select either **[!UICONTROL Batch end-to-end]** or **[!UICONTROL Streaming end-to-end]**. The dashboards list all batch or streaming ingestion runs, including those that are successful, failed, or still in progress. Each listing provides details of the batch, including the batch ID, the name of the target dataset, and the number of records ingested. If the target dataset is enabled for [!DNL Profile], the number of ingested identity and profile records is also displayed.

![The monitoring batch end-to-end screen is shown. Both monitoring and batch-to-batch are highlighted.](../images/datasets/user-guide/batch-listing.png)

You can select on an individual **[!UICONTROL Batch ID]** to access the **[!UICONTROL Batch overview]** dashboard and see details for the batch, including error logs should the batch fail to ingest.

![Details of the selected batch are displayed. This includes the number of records ingested, the number of records failed, the batch status, the file size, the ingestion start and end times, the dataset and batch IDs, the organization ID, the dataset name, and the access information.](../images/datasets/user-guide/batch-overview.png)

If you wish to delete the batch, you can do so by selecting **[!UICONTROL Delete batch]** found near the top right of the dashboard. Doing so will also remove its records from the dataset the batch was originally ingested to.

![The Delete batch button is highlighted on the dataset details page.](../images/datasets/user-guide/delete-batch.png)
