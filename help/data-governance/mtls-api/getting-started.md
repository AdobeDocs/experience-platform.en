# Getting started with the MTLS Service API {#getting-started}

The MTLS Service API lets you securely retrieve and verify the public certificates issued by Adobe.

The following sections provide additional information that you will need to know in order to successfully work with the MTLS Service API.

## Reading sample API calls

The MTLS Service API documentation provides an example API call to demonstrate how to format your requests. This includes the path, required headers, and properly formatted request payload. Sample JSON returned in API responses is also provided. For information on the conventions used in documentation for sample API calls, see the section on [how to read example API calls](../../landing/troubleshooting.md#how-do-i-format-an-api-request) in the Experience Platform troubleshooting guide.

## Required headers

The API documentation also requires you to have completed the [authentication tutorial](https://www.adobe.com/go/platform-api-authentication-en) in order to successfully make calls to Experience Platform endpoints. Completing the authentication tutorial provides the values for each of the required headers in Experience Platform API calls, as shown below:

- Authorization: `Bearer {ACCESS_TOKEN}`
- x-api-key: `{API_KEY}`
- x-gw-ims-org-id: `{ORG_ID}`

## Next steps

To being making calls using the MTLS Service API, select the endpoint guides either using the left navigation or within the [developer guide overview](./overview.md)
