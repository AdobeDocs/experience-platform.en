# Manage data usage labels for datasets using APIs

The [[!DNL Dataset Service API]](https://www.adobe.io/experience-platform-apis/references/dataset-service/) allows you to apply and edit usage labels for datasets. It is part of Adobe Experience Platform's data catalog capabilities, but is separate from the [!DNL Catalog Service] API which manages dataset metadata.

This document covers how to manage labels for datasets and fields using the [!DNL Dataset Service API]. For steps on how to manage data usage labels themselves using API calls, see the [labels endpoint guide](../api/labels.md) for the [!DNL Policy Service API].

## Getting started

Before you read this guide, follow the steps outlined in the [getting started section](../../catalog/api/getting-started.md) in the Catalog developer guide to gather the required credentials to make calls to [!DNL Platform] APIs.

In order to make calls to the endpoints outlined in this document, you must have the unique `id` value for a specific dataset. If you do not have this value, see the guide on [listing Catalog objects](../../catalog/api/list-objects.md) to find the IDs of your existing datasets.

## Look up labels for a dataset {#look-up}

You can look up the data usage labels that have been applied to an existing dataset by making a GET request to the [!DNL Dataset Service] API.

**API format**

```http
GET /datasets/{DATASET_ID}/labels
```

| Parameter | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `{DATASET_ID}` | The unique `id` value of the dataset whose labels you want to look up. |

**Request**

```shell
curl -X GET \
  'https://platform.adobe.io/data/foundation/dataset/datasets/5abd49645591445e1ba04f87/labels' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer {ACCESS_TOKEN}' \
  -H 'x-api-key: {API_KEY}' \
  -H 'x-gw-ims-org-id: {IMS_ORG}' \
  -H 'x-sandbox-name: {SANDBOX_NAME}'
```

**Response**

A successful response returns the data usage labels that have been applied to the dataset.

```json
{
  "AEP:dataset:5abd49645591445e1ba04f87": {
    "imsOrg": "{IMS_ORG}",
    "labels": [ "C1", "C2", "C3", "I1", "I2" ],
    "optionalLabels": [
      {
        "option": {
          "id": "https://ns.adobe.com/{TENANT_ID}/schemas/c6b1b09bc3f2ad2627c1ecc719826836",
          "contentType": "application/vnd.adobe.xed-full+json;version=1",
          "schemaPath": "/properties/repositoryCreatedBy"
        },
        "labels": [ "S1", "S2" ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

| Property | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `labels` | A list of data usage labels that have been applied to the dataset. |
| `optionalLabels` | A list of individual fields within the dataset that have data usage labels applied to them. |

## Apply labels to a dataset {#apply}

You can create a set of labels for a dataset by providing them in the payload of a POST or PUT request to the [!DNL Dataset Service] API. Using either of these methods overwrites any existing labels and replaces them with those provided in the payload.

**API format**

```http
POST /datasets/{DATASET_ID}/labels
PUT /datasets/{DATASET_ID}/labels
```

| Parameter | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `{DATASET_ID}` | The unique `id` value of the dataset that you are creating labels for. |

**Request**

The following PUT request updates the existing labels for a dataset, as well as a specific field within that dataset. The fields provided in the payload are the same as would be required for a POST request.

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>A valid `If-Match` header must be provided when making PUT requests to the `/datasets/{DATASET_ID}/labels` endpoint. See the [appendix section](#if-match) for more information on using the required header.

```shell
curl -X PUT \
  'https://platform.adobe.io/data/foundation/dataset/datasets/5abd49645591445e1ba04f87/labels' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer {ACCESS_TOKEN}' \
  -H 'x-api-key: {API_KEY}' \
  -H 'x-gw-ims-org-id: {IMS_ORG}' \
  -H 'x-sandbox-name: {SANDBOX_NAME}' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H 'If-Match: 8f00d38e-0000-0200-0000-5ef4fc6d0000' \
  -d '{
        "labels": [ "C1", "C2", "C3", "I1", "I2" ],
        "optionalLabels": [
          {
            "option": {
              "id": "https://ns.adobe.com/{TENANT_ID}/schemas/c6b1b09bc3f2ad2627c1ecc719826836",
              "contentType": "application/vnd.adobe.xed-full+json;version=1",
              "schemaPath": "/properties/repositoryCreatedBy"
            },
            "labels": [ "S1", "S2" ]
          }
        ]
      }'
```

| Property | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `labels` | A list of data usage labels that you want to add to the dataset. |
| `optionalLabels` | A list of any individual fields within the dataset that you want to add labels to. Each item in this array must have the following properties: <br/><br/>`option`: An object that contains the [!DNL Experience Data Model] (XDM) attributes of the field. The following three properties are required:<ul><li><code>id</code>: The URI <code>$id</code> value of the schema associated with the field.</li><li><code>contentType</code>: The content type and version number of the schema. This should take the form of one of the valid <a href="../../xdm/api/getting-started.md#accept">Accept headers</a> for an XDM lookup request.</li><li><code>schemaPath</code>: The path to the field within the dataset's schema.</li></ul>`labels`: A list of data usage labels that you want to add to the field. |

**Response**

A successful response returns the labels that have been added to the dataset.

```json
{
  "labels": [ "C1", "C2", "C3", "I1", "I2" ],
  "optionalLabels": [
    {
      "option": {
        "id": "https://ns.adobe.com/{TENANT_ID}/schemas/c6b1b09bc3f2ad2627c1ecc719826836",
        "contentType": "application/vnd.adobe.xed-full+json;version=1",
        "schemaPath": "/properties/repositoryCreatedBy"
      },
      "labels": [ "S1", "S2" ]
    }
  ]
}
```

## Remove labels from a dataset {#remove}

You can remove the labels applied to a dataset by making a DELETE request to the [!DNL Dataset Service] API.

**API format**

```http
DELETE /datasets/{DATASET_ID}/labels
```

| Parameter | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `{DATASET_ID}` | The unique `id` value of the dataset whose labels you want to remove. |

**Request**

The following request removes the labels for the dataset specified in the path.

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>A valid `If-Match` header must be provided when making DELETE requests to the `/datasets/{DATASET_ID}/labels` endpoint. See the [appendix section](#if-match) for more information on using the required header.

```shell
curl -X DELETE \
  'https://platform.adobe.io/data/foundation/dataset/datasets/5abd49645591445e1ba04f87/labels' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer {ACCESS_TOKEN}' \
  -H 'x-api-key: {API_KEY}' \
  -H 'x-gw-ims-org-id: {IMS_ORG}' \
  -H 'x-sandbox-name: {SANDBOX_NAME}' \
  -H 'If-Match: 8f00d38e-0000-0200-0000-5ef4fc6d0000'
```

**Response**

A successful response HTTP status 200 (OK), indicating that the labels have been removed. You can [look up the existing labels](#look-up) for the dataset in a separate call to confirm this.

## Next steps

By reading this document, you have learned how to manage data usage labels for datasets and fields using the [!DNL Dataset Service] API.

Once you have added data usage labels at the dataset- and field-level, you can begin to ingest data into [!DNL Experience Platform]. To learn more, start by reading the [data ingestion documentation](../../ingestion/home.md).

You can also now define data usage policies based on the labels you have applied. For more information, see the [data usage policies overview](../policies/overview.md).

For more information on managing datasets in [!DNL Experience Platform], see the [datasets overview](../../catalog/datasets/overview.md).

## Appendix {#appendix}

The following section contains additional information about working with labels using the Dataset Service API.

### [!DNL If-Match] header {#if-match}

When making API calls that update the existing labels of a dataset (PUT and DELETE), an `If-Match` header that indicates the current version of the dataset-label entity in Dataset Service must be included. In order to prevent data collisions, the service will only update the dataset entity if the included `If-Match` string matches the latest version tag generated by the system for that dataset.

>[!NOTE]
>
>If no labels currently exist for the dataset in question, new labels can only be added through a POST request, which does not require an `If-Match` header. Once labels have been added to a dataset, an `etag` value is assigned which can be used to update or remove the labels at a later time.

To retrieve the most recent version of the dataset-label entity, make a [GET request](#look-up) to the `/datasets/{DATASET_ID}/labels` endpoint. The current value is returned in the response under an `etag` header. When updating existing dataset labels, best practice is to first perform a lookup request for the dataset in order to fetch its latest `etag` value before using that value in the `If-Match` header of your subsequent PUT or DELETE request.
