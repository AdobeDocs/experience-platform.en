# [!DNL Privacy Service] overview

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>Permissions for Adobe Experience Platform Privacy Service have been improved to increase their level of granularity. These changes enable organization admins to grant more users access with the desired role and permission level. Technical account users must update their Privacy Service permissions as this impending update constitutes a breaking change for them. The enforcement of this permissions change will take place on **April 13th, 2023**. See the documentation on [migrating legacy API credentials](./permissions.md#migrate-tech-accounts) for guidance on resolving this issue.
>
>Technical accounts are available to enterprise customers and created through the Adobe Developers Console. The Adobe ID of a technical account holder ends in `@techacct.adobe.com`. If you are unsure whether you are a technical account holder, please contact your organization administrator.

In order to deliver better customer experiences, you need to collect and store your customers' personal data. When using this data, it is important to understand and respect your customers' privacy. New legal and organizational regulations are giving users the right to access or delete their personal data from your data stores upon request.

Adobe Experience Platform [!DNL Privacy Service] was developed in response to a fundamental shift in how businesses are required to manage the personal data of their customers. The central purpose of [!DNL Privacy Service] is to automate compliance with data privacy regulations which, when violated, can result in major fines and disrupt data operations for your business.

[!DNL Privacy Service] provides a RESTful API and user interface to help you manage customer data requests. With [!DNL Privacy Service], you can submit requests to access and delete personal customer data from Adobe Experience Cloud applications, facilitating automated compliance with legal and organizational privacy regulations.

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>Privacy Service is only meant for data subject and consumer rights requests. Any other usage of Privacy Service for data cleanup or maintenance is not supported or allowed. Adobe has a legal obligation to fulfill them in a timely manner. As such, load-testing on Privacy Service is not allowed as it is a production only environment and creates an unnecessary backlog of valid privacy requests.
>
>A hard daily upload limit is now in place to help prevent abuse of the service. Users found to abuse the system will have their access to the service disabled. A subsequent meeting will then be held with them to address their actions and discuss the acceptable use for Privacy Service.

## Getting started with [!DNL Privacy Service] {#getting-started}

In order to make use of [!DNL Privacy Service], several key decisions need to be made in terms of your organization's privacy requirements, the kinds of identity data you collect from your customers, and the best way to interface your CRM system with the service.

These decisions can be summarized through the following questions:

1. **What information am I gathering from my customers?** 
    * To make the best use of [!DNL Privacy Service], you must have a detailed understanding of the types of data you collect from your customers, and which of it is subject to privacy regulations. See the section on [determining privacy requirements](#requirements) for more information.
1. **Have I correctly labeled my data?**
    * Data must be properly labeled in order for the service to determine which fields to access or delete during privacy jobs. See the section on [labelling data](#label) for more information.
1. **Do I know which IDs to send to [!DNL Privacy Service]?** 
    * When sending privacy requests, individual customer IDs specific to particular Adobe applications must be provided. See the sections on [providing identity data](#identity)  and [making privacy requests](#requests) for more information.
1. **How am I tracking my privacy jobs?** 
    * Once you have made privacy requests, there are several options for tracking their status and results. See the section on [monitoring privacy jobs](#monitor) for more information.

The sections below provide general guidance on these important prerequisite steps, and also provide links to further [!DNL Privacy Service] documentation for more details.

### Determine your organization's privacy requirements {#requirements}

Depending on the nature of your business and the jurisdictions it operates under, your data operations may be subject to legal privacy regulations. These regulations often give your customers the right to request access to the data you collect from them, and the right to request the deletion of that stored data. These customer requests for their personal data are referred to as "privacy requests" throughout the documentation.

For details on the different legal privacy regulations that [!DNL Privacy Service] manages requests for, including key terms and answers to frequently asked questions, refer to the [privacy regulations documentation](./regulations/overview.md).

If your data operations fall under the purview of any of the supported regulations, review their documentation for important information such as the specific privacy rights they afford your customers, and compliance windows for honoring privacy requests. This information should be taken into account when determining how to integrate [!DNL Privacy Service] into your CRM system, and how customers should interact with your website in order to make privacy requests.

In addition to legal regulations, any organizational or industry standards applicable to your organization should also be considered when making these decisions.

### Label data for privacy requests {#label}

Depending on the [!DNL Experience Cloud] applications that you are using, you must label the specific data fields that should be accessed or deleted in response to privacy requests. The process for labelling data varies between applications. To learn how to label data for each supported Adobe application, see the document on [Experience Cloud applications](./experience-cloud-apps.md).

### Determine the types of identity data to send to [!DNL Privacy Service] {#identity}

In order for [!DNL Privacy Service] to process a privacy request from a customer, at least one unique identity value for that customer must be provided in the request itself. A unique identity value is any piece of information that can be used to identify an individual person and their stored personal data within your [!DNL Experience Cloud] data stores. [!DNL Privacy Service] uses this identity information to locate and process the customer's personal data according to the nature of the request (access, delete, or opt-out).

Depending on the [!DNL Experience Cloud] applications your CRM system utilizes, the type and number of identity values you must provide for each customer will vary. Some applications utilize their own internal customer ID values (such as Adobe Target IDs), while other solutions rely on global identifiers from Adobe [!DNL Experience Cloud Identity Service] (ECID) which track customer activity across all [!DNL Experience Cloud] applications. In addition, generic personal information like an email address or phone number can also serve as valid identity data.

The document on [identity data for privacy requests](./identity-data.md) provides more detailed information on the types of identity information that are accepted for [!DNL Privacy Service]. The document also provides guidance on how to leverage Adobe technologies to effectively retrieve the appropriate identity information from your customers as they interact with your website, and send that data to [!DNL Privacy Service] in API requests.

### Start making privacy requests {#requests}

Once you have determined your business' privacy needs, and decided which identity values to send to [!DNL Privacy Service], you can start making privacy requests. [!DNL Privacy Service] allows you to send privacy requests through either the API or the UI.

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>The sections below provide links to documentation that cover how to make generic privacy requests in the API or UI. However, depending on the [!DNL Experience Cloud] applications you are using, the fields you must send in the request payload may be different from the examples shown in these guides. 
>
>As you follow along with the API or UI guides, please refer to the document on [Privacy Service and Experience Cloud applications](./experience-cloud-apps.md) for further documentation on how to format privacy requests for your particular [!DNL Experience Cloud] application(s).
>
>It is also important to note that privacy requests are processed asynchronously across Experience Cloud applications. Once a request is received by Privacy Service, each application can take anywhere from minutes to weeks to complete the request. The amount of time it takes to complete each request is specific to the application you are working with, and the amount of data that needs to be processed.

#### Using the API

The [[!DNL Privacy Service API]](https://www.adobe.io/experience-platform-apis/references/privacy-service/) provides several endpoints for creating and managing privacy jobs using RESTful API calls, allowing you to programmatically approach privacy regulation compliance for your [!DNL Experience Cloud] applications. For detailed steps on how to use the API, see the [Privacy Service API guide](api/overview.md).

#### Using the UI

>[!NOTE]
>
>The [!DNL Privacy Service] UI currently only supports access and delete requests. All opt-out requests must be made through the API instead.

The [!DNL Privacy Service] UI allows you to create and monitor privacy jobs using a graphical interface. The UI includes a **[!UICONTROL Status Report]** widget that provides a visual representation of the status of all active requests, and allows you to create new requests by using the built-in **[!UICONTROL Request Builder]** or by uploading JSON files. For more information on using the UI, see the [Privacy Service user guide](ui/overview.md).

### Monitor privacy jobs {#monitor}

Once you have made privacy jobs, you have several options for monitoring their status and results:

| Monitoring method | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [!DNL Privacy Service] UI | The [!DNL Privacy Service] UI provides a monitoring dashboard that allows you to view a visual representation of the status of all active requests. See the [Privacy Service user guide](ui/overview.md) for more information. |
| [!DNL Privacy Service] API | You can programmatically monitor the status of Privacy jobs by using the lookup endpoints provided by the [!DNL Privacy Service] API. See the [Privacy Service API guide](./api/overview.md) for detailed steps on how to use the API. |
| [!DNL Privacy Events] | [!DNL Privacy Events] leverage Adobe I/O Events sent to a configured webhook in order to facilitate efficient job request automation. They reduce or eliminate the need to poll the [!DNL Privacy Service] API in order to check if a job is complete or if a certain milestone within a workflow has been reached. See the tutorial on [subscribing to Privacy Events](./privacy-events.md) for more information. |
