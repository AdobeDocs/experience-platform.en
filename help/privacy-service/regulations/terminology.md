**CPA**: The [!DNL Colorado Privacy Act] (CPA) provides Colorado consumers additional insight into what personal data controllers collect, share and sell, and how that data is used. The CPA protects the personal data of Colorado residents when they act in an individual or household context.

**CTDPA**: The [!DNL Connecticut Data Privacy Act] (CTDPA) grants Connecticut residents certain rights over their personal data and establishes responsibilities and privacy protection standards for data controllers that process their personal data. The CTDPA grants them the following rights: to access, correct, delete, obtain a copy, or opt-out of the sale; processing; or profiling of their personal data. The CTDPA protects a Connecticut resident acting as an individual or in a household context.

**Consent**: Freely given, specific, informed and explicit consent by statement or action signifying agreement to the processing of their personal data.

**Data controller**: The entity that determines the purposes, conditions and means of the processing of personal data.

**Data erasure**: Also known as the Right to be Forgotten, it entitles the data subject to have the data controller erase his/her personal data, cease further dissemination of the data, and potentially have third parties cease processing of the data.

**Data portability**: The requirement for controllers to provide the data subject with a copy of his or her data in a format that allows for easy use with another controller.

**Data processor**: The entity that processes data on behalf of the Data Controller.

**Data protection authority**: National authorities tasked with the protection of data and privacy as well as monitoring and enforcement of the data protection regulations within the Union.

**Enterprise**: Any entity engaged in economic activity, regardless of legal form, including persons, partnerships, associations, etc.

**Explicit consent**: A standard of consent which involves a specific, informed, and unambiguous indication of the data subject's wishes in oral or written form.

In addition, it must be as easy to withdraw consent as it is to give it.

## F

**Filing system**: Any specific set of personal data that is accessible according to specific criteria, or able to be queried.

Users can log in directly with Renga (the Adobe identity services provider), or log in through a trusted third party authentication domain (such as [!DNL Google], [!DNL Facebook], or a corporate/organization LDAP).

**Implicit consent**: Also known as unambiguous consent, this refers to consent that was not explicitly given by the data subject, but is nonetheless unambiguous in nature. For example, during the sign-up process for a company website, a notice is given that by providing an email address, the data subject consents to receiving emails on special offers. If the data subject reads the notice, the affirmative action of entering their email is enough to be considered implicit consent.

**IMS Org ID**: Refers to an Adobe authorization token for service-to-service authentication, which does not require user login. It is issued to an IMS client, and has no associated user. An IMS client needs a service token to authorize back-channel requests between services. (The term "system token" is occasionally used to mean service token.)
