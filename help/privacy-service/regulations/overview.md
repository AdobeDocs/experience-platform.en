|-----------|-------------------|-------------|
| APA (Australia) | `apa_aus` | The [[!DNL Australia Privacy Act (Privacy Act)]](https://www.oaic.gov.au/privacy/the-privacy-act) promotes and protects individuals' privacy and regulates how Australian Government agencies and organizations handle personal information. The Privacy Act includes principles that apply to private-sector organizations. For example, individuals are afforded the right to understand why the personal information is being collected and how it will be used, the ability to access, erase their data, and correct personal information. |
| CCPA (California) | `ccpa` | The [[!DNL California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA)]](https://oag.ca.gov/privacy/ccpa) enhances privacy rights and consumer protection for residents of California, United States. The CCPA provides new data privacy rights to California residents. They include the right to access and delete their personal data, to know whether their personal data is sold or disclosed (and to whom), and the right to opt out of having their data sold to third parties. |
| CPA (Colorado) | `cpa_co_usa` | The [[!DNL Colorado Privacy Act]](https://coag.gov/resources/colorado-privacy-act/) (CPA) provides Colorado consumers additional insight into what personal data controllers collect, share, and sell, and how that data is used. The CPA protects the personal data of Colorado residents when they act in an individual or household context. These rules detail the technical specifications for one or more universal opt-out mechanisms. These mechanisms clearly communicate a consumer's affirmative, freely given, and unambiguous choice to opt out of the processing of personal data for purposes of targeted advertising or the sale of personal data. |
| CPRA (California) | `cpra_ca_usa` | The [[!DNL California Consumer Privacy Rights Act (CPRA)]](https://cppa.ca.gov/regulations/consumer_privacy_act.html) expands and amends portions of the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA).
