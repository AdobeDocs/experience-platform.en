# Subscribe to [!DNL Privacy Service Events]

[!DNL Privacy Service Events] are messages provided by Adobe Experience Platform [!DNL Privacy Service], which leverage Adobe I/O Events sent to a configured webhook to facilitate efficient job request automation. They reduce or eliminate the need to poll the [!DNL Privacy Service] API in order to check if a job is complete or if a certain milestone within a workflow has been reached.

There are currently four types of notifications related to the privacy job request lifecycle:

| Type | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Job Complete | All [!DNL Experience Cloud] applications have reported back and the overall or global status of the job has been marked as complete. |
| Job Error | One or more applications have reported an error while processing the request. |
| Product Complete | One of the applications associated with this job has completed its work. |
| Product Error | One of the applications reported an error while processing the request. |

This document provides steps for setting up an event registration for [!DNL Privacy Service] notifications, and how to interpret notification payloads.

## Getting started

Please review the following Privacy Service documentation before starting this tutorial:

* [Privacy Service overview](./home.md)

## Register a webhook to [!DNL Privacy Service Events]

In order to receive [!DNL Privacy Service Events], you must use Adobe Developer Console to register a webhook to your [!DNL Privacy Service] integration.

Follow the tutorial on [subscribing to [!DNL I/O Event] notifications](../observability/alerts/subscribe.md) for detailed steps on how to accomplish this. Ensure that you choose **[!UICONTROL Privacy Service Events]** as your event provider in order to access the events listed above.

## Receive [!DNL Privacy Service Event] notifications

Once you have successfully registered your webhook and privacy jobs have been run, you can start receiving event notifications.

The following JSON is an example of a [!DNL Privacy Service Event] notification payload that would be sent to your webhook when one of the applications associated with a privacy job has completed its work:
