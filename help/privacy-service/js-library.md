# Adobe Privacy JavaScript Library overview

As a data processor, Adobe processes personal data in accordance with your company's permission and instructions. As the data controller, you determine the personal data that Adobe processes and stores on your behalf. Depending on the information you choose to send through Adobe Experience Cloud solutions, Adobe can store private information applicable to privacy regulations such as the [!DNL General Data Protection Regulation] (GDPR) and [!DNL California Consumer Privacy Act] (CCPA). See the document on [privacy in Adobe Experience Cloud](https://www.adobe.com/privacy/marketing-cloud.html) for more information on how Experience Cloud solutions collect private data.

The **Adobe Privacy JavaScript Library** allows data controllers to automate the retrieval of all data subject identities generated by [!DNL Experience Cloud] solutions for a specific domain. Using the API provided by [Adobe Experience Platform Privacy Service](home.md), these identities can then be used to create access and delete requests for private data belonging to those data subjects.

>[!NOTE]
>
>The [!DNL Privacy JS Library] typically only needs to be installed on privacy-related pages, and is not required to be installed on all pages of a website or domain.

## Functions

The [!DNL Privacy JS Library] provides several functions for managing identities in [!DNL Privacy Service]. These functions can only be used to manage the identities that are stored in the browser for a specific visitor. They cannot be used to submit information to the [!DNL Experience Cloud Central Service] directly. 

The following table outlines the different functions provided by the library:

| Function | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `retrieveIdentities` | Returns an array of matching identities (`validIds`) that were retrieved from [!DNL Privacy Service], as well as an array of identities that were not found (`failedIds`). |
| `removeIdentities` | Removes each matching (valid) identity from the browser. Returns an array of matching identities (`validIds`), with each identity containing a `isDeletedClientSide` boolean which indicates whether this ID has been deleted. |
| `retrieveThenRemoveIdentities` | Retrieves an array of matching identities (`validIds`), and then removes those identities from the browser. While this function is similar to `removeIdentities`, it is best used when the Adobe solution you are using requires an access request before deletion is possible (such as when a unique identifier must be retrieved before providing it in a delete request). |

>[!NOTE]
>
>`removeIdentities` and `retrieveThenRemoveIdentities` only remove identities from the browser for specific Adobe solutions that support them. For example, Adobe Audience Manager does not delete the demdex IDs that are stored in third-party cookies, while Adobe Target deletes all cookies storing their IDs.

Since all three functions represent asynchronous processes, any retrieved identities must be handled using callbacks or promises.


## Installation

To start using the [!DNL Privacy JS Library], you must install it onto your machine using one of the following methods:

* Install using npm by running the following command: `npm install @adobe/adobe-privacy`
* Download from the [Experience Cloud GitHub repository](https://github.com/Adobe-Marketing-Cloud/adobe-privacy)

You can also install the library through a tag extension. See the overview on the [Adobe Privacy tag extension](../tags/extensions/web/privacy/overview.md) for more information.

## Instantiate the [!DNL Privacy JS Library]

All apps that utilize the [!DNL Privacy JS Library] must instantiate a new `AdobePrivacy` object, which must be configured to a specific Adobe solution. For example, an instantiation for Adobe Analytics would look similar to the following:

```js
var adobePrivacy = new AdobePrivacy({
    imsOrgID: "{ORG_ID}",
    reportSuite: "{REPORT_SUITE_ID}",
    trackingServer: "{SERVER_URL}",
    clientCode: "{TARGET_CLIENT_CODE}"
});
```

For a full list of supported parameters for different Adobe solutions, see the appendix section on supported [Adobe solution configuration parameters](#adobe-solution-configuration-parameters).

## Code samples {#samples}

The following code samples demonstrate how to use the [!DNL Privacy JS Library] for several common scenarios, provided that you are not using tags.

### Retrieve identities

This example demonstrates how to retrieve a list of identities from [!DNL Experience Cloud].

#### JavaScript

The following code defines a function, `handleRetrievedIDs`, to be used as a callback or promise to handle the identities retrieved by `retrieveIdentities`.

```javascript
function handleRetrievedIDs(ids) {
    const validIDs = ids.validIDs;
    const failedIDs = ids.failedIDs;
}

// If using callbacks:
adobePrivacy.retrieveIdentities(handleRetrievedIDs);

// If using promises:
adobePrivacy.retrieveIdentities().then(handleRetrievedIDs);
```

| Variable | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `validIds` |  A JSON object containing all the IDs that were retrieved successfully.  |
| `failedIDs` | A JSON object containing all the IDs that were not retrieved from [!DNL Privacy Service], or otherwise could not be found.  |

#### Result

If the code executes successfully, `validIDs` is populated with a list of retrieved identities.

```json
{
    "company": "adobe",
    "namespace": "ECID",
    "namespaceId": 4,
    "type": "standard",
    "name": "Experience Cloud ID",
    "description": "This is the ID generated by the ID Service.",
    "value": "79352169365966186342525781172209986543"
},
{
    "company": "adobe",
    "namespace": "gsurfer_id",
    "namespaceId": 411,
    "type": "standard",
    "value": "WqmIJQAAB669Ciao"
}
```

### Remove identities

This example demonstrates how to remove a list of identities from the browser.

#### JavaScript

The following code defines a function, `handleRemovedIDs`, to be used as a callback or promise to handle the identities retrieved by `removeIdentities` after they have been removed from the browser.

```javascript
function handleRemovedIDs(ids) {
    const validIDs = ids.validIDs;
    const failedIDs = ids.failedIDs;
}

// If using callbacks:
adobePrivacy.removeIdentities(handleRemovedIDs);

// If using promises:
adobePrivacy.removeIdentities().then(handleRemovedIDs)…
```

| Variable | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `validIds` |  A JSON object containing all the IDs that were retrieved successfully.  |
| `failedIDs` | A JSON object containing all the IDs that were not retrieved from [!DNL Privacy Service], or otherwise could not be found.  |

#### Result

If the code executes successfully, `validIDs` is populated with a list of retrieved identities.

```json
{
    "company": "adobe",
    "namespace": "ECID",
    "namespaceId": 4,
    "type": "standard",
    "name": "Experience Cloud ID",
    "description": "This is the ID generated by the ID Service.",
    "value": "79352169365966186342525781172209986543",
    "isDeletedClientSide": false
},
{
    "company": "adobe",
    "namespace": "AMO",
    "namespaceId": 411,
    "type": "standard",
    "value": "WqmIJQAAB669Ciao",
    "isDeletedClientSide": true
}
```

## Next steps

By reading this document, you have been introduced to the core functionalities of the [!DNL Privacy JS Library]. After using the library to retrieve a list of identities, you can use those identities to create data access and delete requests to the [!DNL Privacy Service] API. See the [Privacy Service API guide](api/overview.md) for more information.
