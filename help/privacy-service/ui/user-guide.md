# Manage privacy jobs in the Privacy Service UI {#user-guide}

>title="Honor data subject privacy requests"
>abstract="<h2>Description</h2><p>Adobe Experience Platform Privacy Service allows you to create and manage privacy requests on behalf of customers that want to access or delete their personal data in accordance with legal privacy regulations.</p>"

This document provides steps for creating and managing privacy requests using the [!DNL Privacy Service] user interface.

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>Privacy Service is only meant for data subject and consumer rights requests. Any other usage of Privacy Service for data cleanup or maintenance is not supported or allowed. Adobe has a legal obligation to fulfill them in a timely manner. As such, load-testing on Privacy Service is not allowed as it is a production only environment and creates an unnecessary backlog of valid privacy requests.
>
>A hard daily upload limit is now in place to help prevent abuse of the service. Users found to abuse the system will have their access to the service disabled. A subsequent meeting will then be held with them to address their actions and discuss the acceptable use for Privacy Service.

## Browse the [!DNL Privacy Service] UI dashboard

The dashboard for the [!DNL Privacy Service] UI provides two widgets that allow you to view the status of your privacy jobs: "[!UICONTROL Status Report]" and "[!UICONTROL Job Requests]". The dashboard also displays the current selected regulation for the displayed jobs.

>[!NOTE]

>See the overview on [supported privacy regulations](../regulations/overview.md) for more information on the legal context of each regulation.

Jobs for each regulation type are tracked separately. To switch between regulation types, select the **[!UICONTROL Regulation Type]** dropdown menu and select the desired regulation from the list.

![Regulation Type dropdown](../images/user-guide/regulation.png)

Upon changing the regulation type, the dashboard updates to show all operations, filters, widgets, and job-creation dialogs that apply to the selected regulation.

![Updated dashboard](../images/user-guide/dashboard-update.png)

### Status Report

The graph on the left-hand side of the Status Report widget tracks submitted jobs against any jobs that may have reported back with errors. The graph on the right-hand side tracks jobs nearing the end of the 30-day compliance window.

Select one of the two toggle buttons above the graph to show or hide their respective metrics.

![](../images/user-guide/hide-errors.png)

You can view the exact number of jobs associated with any data point on the graphs by hovering your mouse over the data point in question.

![Mouse-over data points](../images/user-guide/mouse-over.png)

To view further details about a given data point, select the data point in question to display the associated jobs in the Job Requests widget. Take note of the filter that is applied just above the job list.

![Applied filter from widget](../images/user-guide/apply-filter.png)

>[!NOTE]
>
>When a filter has been applied to the Job Requests widget, you can remove the filter by selecting the **X** on the filter pill. Job Requests then return to the default tracking list.

### Job Requests

The Job Requests widget lists all available job requests in your organization, including details such as the request type, current status, due date, and requestor email.

>[!NOTE]
>
>The data for previously created jobs is only accessible for 30 days after the completion date.

You can filter the list by typing keywords into the search bar below the Job Requests title. The list automatically filters as you type, showing requests that contain values that match your search terms. You can also use the **[!UICONTROL Requested on]** dropdown menu to select a time range for the listed jobs.

![Job Request search options](../images/user-guide/job-search.png)

To view the details of a particular job request, select the request's job ID from the list to open the **[!UICONTROL Job Details]** page.

![GDPR UI Job Details](../images/user-guide/job-details.png)

This dialog contains status information about each [!DNL Experience Cloud] solution and its current state in relation to the overall job. As every privacy job is asynchronous, the page displays the latest communication date and time (GMT) from each solution, as some require more time than others to process the request.

If a solution has provided any additional data, it is viewable in this dialog. You can view this data by selecting individual product rows.

To download the complete job data as a CSV file, select **[!UICONTROL Export to CSV]** at the top-right of the dialog.

>In order to create a privacy job request, you must provide identity information for the specific customers whose data is to be accessed or deleted. Please review the document on [identity data for privacy requests](../identity-data.md) before continuing with this section.

The [!DNL Privacy Service] UI provides two methods to create new job requests:

* [Use the Request Builder](#request-builder)
* [Upload a JSON file](#json)

Steps for using each of these methods are provided in the following sections.

### Use the Request Builder {#request-builder}

Using the Request Builder, you can manually create a new privacy job request in the user interface. The Request Builder is best used for simpler and smaller sets of requests, because the Request Builder limits requests to have only ID type per user. For more complicated requests, it may better to [upload a JSON file](#json) instead.

To start using the Request builder, select **[!UICONTROL Create Request]** below the Status Report widget on the right-hand side of the screen.

![Select Create Request](../images/user-guide/create-request.png)

The **[!UICONTROL Create Request]** dialog opens, displaying the available options for submitting a privacy job request for the currently selected regulation type.

<img src="../images/user-guide/request-builder.png" width=500 /><br/>

Select the **[!UICONTROL Job Type]** of the request ("Delete" or "Access") and one or more available products from the list.

<img src="../images/user-guide/type-and-products.png" width=500 /><br/>

Under **[!UICONTROL Namespace type]**, select the appropriate namespace type for the customer IDs being sent to [!DNL Privacy Service].

<img src="../images/user-guide/namespace-type.png" width=500 /><br/>

When using the standard namespace type, select a namespace from the drop-down menu (email, ECID, or AAID), then type the ID values in the textbox to the right, pressing **\<enter>** for each ID to add it to the list.

<img src="../images/user-guide/standard-namespace.png" width=500 /><br/>

When using the custom namespace type, you must manually type in the namespace before providing the ID values below.

<img src="../images/user-guide/custom-namespace.png" width=500 /><br/>

When finished, select **[!UICONTROL Create]**.

<img src="../images/user-guide/request-builder-create.png" width=500 /><br/>

The dialog disappears, and the new job (or jobs) are listed in the Job Requests widget along with their current processing status.

### Upload a JSON file {#json}

When creating more complicated requests, such as those that use multiple ID types for each data subject being processed, you can create a request by uploading a JSON file.

Select the arrow next to **[!UICONTROL Create Request]**, below the Status Report widget on the right-hand side of the screen. From the list of options that appears, select **[!UICONTROL Upload JSON]**.

![Request creation options](../images/user-guide/create-options.png)

The **[!UICONTROL Upload JSON]** dialog appears, providing a window for you to drag and drop your JSON file into.

<img src="../images/user-guide/upload-json.png" width=500 /><br/>

If you do not have a JSON file to upload, select **[!UICONTROL Download Adobe-GDPR-Request.json]** to download a template that you can populate according to the values you have collected from your data subjects.


<img src="../images/user-guide/privacy-template.png" width=500 /><br/>


Locate the JSON file on your computer, and drag it into the dialog window. If the upload is successful, the file name appears in the dialog. You can continue to add more JSON files as necessary by dragging and dropping them into the dialog.

When finished, select **[!UICONTROL Create]**. The dialog disappears, and the new job (or jobs) are listed in the Job Requests widget along with their current processing status.

### Next steps

By reading this document, you have learned how to use the [!DNL Privacy Service] UI to create a privacy job, view a job's details and monitor its processing status, and download the results once it has completed.

For steps on how to perform these operations programmatically using the [!DNL Privacy Service] API, please refer to the [API guide](../api/overview.md).
