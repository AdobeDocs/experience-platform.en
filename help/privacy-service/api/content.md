# Content endpoint

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>The `/content` endpoint is currently in beta and your organization may not yet have access to it yet. The functionality and documentation are subject to change.

Use the `/content` endpoint to securely retrieve *access information* (the information that a privacy subject can rightfully request to access) for your customers. The download URL provided in the response to a `/jobs/{JOB_ID}` GET request points to an Adobe service endpoint. You can then make a GET request to `/jobs/:JOB_ID/content` to return your customer data in JSON format. This access method implements multiple layers of authentication and access control to enhance security.

Before using this guide, please refer to the [getting started guide](./getting-started.md) for information on the required authentication headers presented in the example API call below.

>[!TIP]
>
>If you do not currently know the job ID for the access information you require, make a call to the `/jobs` endpoint and use additional query parameters to filter the results. A complete list of the available query parameters can be found in the [privacy jobs endpoint guide](./privacy-jobs.md).

## Retrieve privacy job information

To retrieve information about a specific job, such as its current processing status, include that job's `jobId` in the path of a GET request to the `/jobs` endpoint.

**API format**

```http
GET /jobs/{JOB_ID}
```

**Request**

The following request retrieves the details of the job whose `jobId` is provided in the request path.

```shell
curl -X GET \
  https://platform.adobe.io/data/core/privacy/jobs/dbe3a6a6-f8e6-11ee-a365-8d1d6df81cc5 \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer {ACCESS_TOKEN}' \
  -H 'x-api-key: {API_KEY}' \
  -H 'x-gw-ims-org-id: {ORG_ID}'
```

**Response**

A successful response returns the details of the specified job.

>[!NOTE]
>
>Privacy jobs must have the `complete` status to contain the `downloadUrl`.

## Retrieve customer access information {#retrieve-access-data}

To get the 'access information' produced in response to your data subject's query, make a GET request to the `/jobs/{JOB_ID}/content` endpoint. The response is a zip file (*.zip) that contains a folder with sub-folders for each product that holds data on the data subject.

>[!TIP]
>
>You need a specific job ID to make this request. If you need to retrieve the specific job ID, first make a GET request to the `/jobs` endpoint and use additional query parameters to filter the results. Detailed information including the allowed query parameters can be found in the [privacy jobs endpoint guide](./privacy-jobs.md).

**API format**

```http
GET /jobs/{JOB_ID}/content
```

**Request**

The following request returns 'access information' for the job ID provided in the request.

```shell
curl -X GET \
  https://platform.adobe.io/data/core/privacy/jobs/32d429b1-f7f4-11ee-a365-574bcf5a525d/content \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer {ACCESS_TOKEN}' \
  -H 'x-api-key: {API_KEY}' \
  -H 'x-gw-ims-org-id: {ORG_ID}' \ 
  -H 'Accept: application/json`
```

**Response**

The response is a zip file (*.zip). The information is typically returned in JSON format, although that cannot be guaranteed. Extracted data can be returned in any format.
