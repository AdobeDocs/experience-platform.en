# Source connectors

Adobe Experience Platform allows data to be ingested from external sources while providing you with the ability to structure, label, and enhance incoming data using [!DNL Platform] services. You can ingest data from a variety of sources such as Adobe applications, cloud-based storage, third party software, and your CRM.

[!DNL Experience Platform] provides a RESTful API and an interactive UI that lets you set-up source connections to various data providers with ease. These source connections enable you to authenticate your storage systems and CRM services, set times for ingestion runs, and manage data ingestion throughput.

More information about these source connectors can be found in the [source connectors documentation](../sources/home.md).
