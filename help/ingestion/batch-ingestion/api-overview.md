# Batch ingestion developer guide

This document provides a comprehensive guide to using [batch ingestion API endpoints](https://developer.adobe.com/experience-platform-apis/references/batch-ingestion/) in Adobe Experience Platform. For an overview of batch ingestion APIs, including prerequisites and best practices, please begin by reading the [batch ingestion API overview](overview.md).

The appendix to this document provides information for [formatting data to be used for ingestion](#data-transformation-for-batch-ingestion), including sample CSV and JSON data files.

## Getting started

The API endpoints used in this guide is part of the [Batch Ingestion API](https://developer.adobe.com/experience-platform-apis/references/batch-ingestion/). Batch ingestion is provided through a RESTful API where you can perform basic CRUD operations against the supported object types.

Before continuing, please review the [batch ingestion API overview](overview.md) and the [getting started guide](getting-started.md). 

## Ingest JSON files

>[!NOTE]
>
>The following steps are applicable for small files (256 MB or less). If you hit a gateway timeout or request body size errors, you need to switch to large file upload.

### Create batch

Firstly, you will need to create a batch, with JSON as the input format. When creating the batch, you will need to provide a dataset ID. You will also need to ensure that all the files uploaded as part of the batch conform to the XDM schema linked to the provided dataset.

>[!NOTE]
>
>The examples below are for single-line JSON. To ingest multi-line JSON, the `isMultiLineJson` flag will need to be set. For more information, please read the [batch ingestion troubleshooting guide](./troubleshooting.md).

**API format**

```http
POST /batches
```

**Request**

```shell
curl -X POST https://platform.adobe.io/data/foundation/import/batches \

## Delete a batch {#delete-a-batch}

A batch can be deleted by performing the following POST request with the `action=REVERT` query parameter to the ID of the batch you wish to delete. The batch is the marked as "inactive", making it eligible for garbage collection. The batch will be asynchronously collected, at which time it will be marked as "deleted".

**API format**

```http
POST /batches/{BATCH_ID}?action=REVERT
```

| Parameter | Description |
| --------- | ----------- |
| `{BATCH_ID}` | The ID of the batch you want to delete. |

  -H 'x-gw-ims-org-id: {ORG_ID}' \
  -H 'x-api-key: {API_KEY}' \
  -H 'x-sandbox-name: {SANDBOX_NAME}' 
```

**Response**

```http
200 OK
```

## Patch a batch

Occasionally it may be necessary to update data in your organization's Profile Store. For example, you may need to correct records or change an attribute value. Adobe Experience Platform supports the update or patch of Profile Store data through an upsert action or "patching a batch".

>[!NOTE]
>
>These updates are allowed only on profile records, not experience events.

The following is required in order to patch a batch:

- **A dataset enabled for Profile and attribute updates.** This is done through dataset tags and requires a specific `isUpsert:true` tag be added to the `unifiedProfile` array. For details steps showing how to create a dataset or configure an existing dataset for upsert, follow the tutorial for [enabling a dataset for Profile updates](../../catalog/datasets/enable-upsert.md).
- **A Parquet file containing the fields to be patched and identity fields for the Profile.** The data format for patching a batch is similar to the regular batch ingestion process. The input required is a Parquet file, and in addition to the fields to be updated, the uploaded data must contain the identity fields in order to match the data in the Profile Store.

Once you have a dataset enabled for Profile and upsert, and a Parquet file containing the fields you wish to patch as well the necessary identity fields, you can follow the steps for [ingesting Parquet files](#ingest-parquet-files) in order to complete the patch via batch ingestion.

## Replay a batch

If you want to replace an already ingested batch, you can do so with "batch replay" - this action is equivalent to deleting the old batch and ingesting a new one instead.

### Create batch

Firstly, you will need to create a batch, with JSON as the input format. When creating the batch, you will need to provide a dataset ID. You will also need to ensure that all the files uploaded as part of the batch conform to the XDM schema linked to the provided dataset. Additionally, you will need to provide the old batch(es) as reference in the replay section. In the example below, you are replaying batches with IDs `batchIdA` and `batchIdB`.

**API format**

```http
POST /batches
```

**Request**

```shell
curl -X POST https://platform.adobe.io/data/foundation/import/batches \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer {ACCESS_TOKEN}' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H 'x-gw-ims-org-id: {ORG_ID}' \

                "reason": "replace"
             }
      }'
```

| Parameter | Description |
| --------- | ----------- | 
| `{DATASET_ID}` | The ID of the reference dataset. |

**Response**

    },
    "version": "1.0.0",
    "tags": {},
    "createdUser": "{USER_ID}",
    "updatedUser": "{USER_ID}"
}
```

| Parameter | Description |
| --------- | ----------- |
| `{BATCH_ID}` | The ID of the newly created batch. |
| `{DATASET_ID}` | The ID of the referenced dataset. |
| `{USER_ID}` | The ID of the user who created the batch. |


### Upload files

Now that you have created a batch, you can use the `batchId` from before to upload files to the batch. You can upload multiple files to the batch.

**API format**

```http
PUT /batches/{BATCH_ID}/datasets/{DATASET_ID}/files/{FILE_NAME}
```

| Parameter | Description |
| --------- | ----------- |
| `{BATCH_ID}` | The ID of the batch you want to upload to. |
| `{DATASET_ID}` | The ID of the batch's reference dataset. |
| `{FILE_NAME}` | The name of the file you want to upload. Ensure that you use a unique file name so that it does not clash with another file for the batch of files being submitted. |

**Request**

>[!CAUTION]
>
>This API supports single-part upload. Ensure that the content-type is application/octet-stream. Do not use the curl -F option, as it defaults to multi-part request that is incompatible with the API.

```shell
curl -X PUT https://platform.adobe.io/data/foundation/import/batches/{BATCH_ID}/datasets/{DATASET_ID}/files/{FILE_NAME}.json \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer {ACCESS_TOKEN}' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/octet-stream' \
  -H 'x-gw-ims-org-id: {ORG_ID}' \
  -H 'x-api-key: {API_KEY}' \
  -H 'x-sandbox-name: {SANDBOX_NAME}' \
  --data-binary "@{FILE_PATH_AND_NAME}.json"
```

| Parameter | Description |
| --------- | ----------- |
| `{FILE_PATH_AND_NAME}` | The full path and name of the file you are trying to upload. This file path is the local file path, such as `acme/customers/campaigns/summer.json`. |

**Response**

```http
200 OK
```

### Complete batch

Once you have finished uploading all the different parts of the file, you will need to signal that the data has been fully uploaded, and that the batch is ready for promotion.

**API format**

```http
POST /batches/{BATCH_ID}?action=COMPLETE
```

| Parameter | Description |
| --------- | ----------- |
| `{BATCH_ID}` | The ID of the batch you want to complete. |

**Request**

```shell
curl -X POST https://platform.adobe.io/data/foundation/import/batches/{BATCH_ID}?action=COMPLETE \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer {ACCESS_TOKEN}' \
  -H 'x-gw-ims-org-id: {ORG_ID}' \
  -H 'x-api-key: {API_KEY}' \
  -H 'x-sandbox-name: {SANDBOX_NAME}'
```

**Response**

```http
200 OK
```

## Appendix

The following section contains additional information for ingesting data in Experience Platform using batch ingestion.

### Data transformation for batch ingestion

In order to ingest a data file into [!DNL Experience Platform], the hierarchical structure of the file must comply with the [Experience Data Model (XDM)](../../xdm/home.md) schema associated with the dataset being uploaded to.

Information on how to map a CSV file to comply with an XDM schema can be found in the [sample transformations](../../etl/transformations.md) document, along with an example of a properly formatted JSON data file. Sample files provided in the document can be found here:

- [CRM_profiles.csv](https://github.com/adobe/experience-platform-etl-reference/blob/master/example_files/CRM_profiles.csv)
- [CRM_profiles.json](https://github.com/adobe/experience-platform-etl-reference/blob/master/example_files/CRM_profiles.json)
