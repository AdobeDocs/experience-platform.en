# [!DNL Kafka] connector for Adobe Experience Platform

The stream connector for Adobe Experience Platform is based on [!DNL Apache Kafka Connect]. This library can be used to stream JSON events from [!DNL Kafka] topics in your data center directly to [!DNL Experience Platform] in real time.

The stream connector is a sink (one-way) connector, delivering data from [!DNL Kafka] topics to a registered endpoint on [!DNL Experience Platform]. To use this connector, you must download the library, add it to your existing [!DNL Kafka] deployment, and configure the [!DNL Kafka] topic(s) to the Adobe Streaming HTTP URL. Additional code is **not** required. The connector supports the following features:

- Authenticated collection of data
- Batching messages to reduce network calls and increase throughput

For more information on the [!DNL Kafka] connector, including instructions on how to set up the connector, please read the [getting started guide](https://github.com/adobe/experience-platform-streaming-connect). For a more detailed workflow, please read the [developer guide](https://www.adobe.com/go/kafka-connector-developer-guide).
