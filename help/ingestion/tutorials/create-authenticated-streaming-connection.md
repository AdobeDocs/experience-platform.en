# Create an authenticated streaming connection

Authenticated Data Collection allows Adobe Experience Platform services, such as [!DNL Real-Time Customer Profile] and [!DNL Identity], to differentiate between records coming from trusted sources and untrusted sources. Clients that want to send Personally Identifiable Information (PII) can do so by sending access tokens as part of the POST request.

To learn how to create an authenticated streaming connection, please read the [HTTP API source API guide](../../sources/tutorials/api/create/streaming/http.md).
