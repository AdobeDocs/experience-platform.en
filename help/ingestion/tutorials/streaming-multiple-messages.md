# Send multiple messages in a single HTTP request

When streaming data to Adobe Experience Platform, making numerous HTTP calls can be expensive. For instance, instead of creating 200 HTTP requests with 1KB payloads, it is much more efficient to create 1 HTTP request with 200 messages of 1KB each, with a single payload of 200KB. When used correctly, grouping multiple messages within a single request is an excellent way to optimize data being sent to [!DNL Experience Platform].

This document provides a tutorial for sending multiple messages to [!DNL Experience Platform] within a single HTTP request using streaming ingestion. 
   
## Getting started

This tutorial requires a working understanding of Adobe Experience Platform [!DNL Data Ingestion]. Before beginning this tutorial, please review the following documentation:

- [Data Ingestion overview](../home.md): Covers the core concepts of [!DNL Experience Platform Data Ingestion], including ingestion methods and data connectors.
- [Streaming ingestion overview](../streaming-ingestion/overview.md): The workflow and building blocks of streaming ingestion, such as streaming connections, datasets, [!DNL XDM Individual Profile], and [!DNL XDM ExperienceEvent].

This tutorial also requires you to have completed the [Authentication to Adobe Experience Platform](https://www.adobe.com/go/platform-api-authentication-en) tutorial in order to successfully make calls to [!DNL Platform] APIs. Completing the authentication tutorial provides the value for the Authorization header required by all API calls in this tutorial. The header is shown in sample calls as follows:

- Authorization: Bearer `{ACCESS_TOKEN}`

All POST requests require an additional header:

- Content-Type: application/json

## Create a streaming connection

You must first create a streaming connection before you can start streaming data to [!DNL Experience Platform]. Read the [create a streaming connection](./create-streaming-connection.md) guide to learn how to create a streaming connection.

After registering a streaming connection, you, as the data producer, will have a unique URL which can be used to stream data to Platform.

## Stream to a dataset

The following example shows how to send multiple messages to a specific dataset within a single HTTP request. Insert the dataset ID in the message header to have that message directly ingested into it.

You can get the ID for an existing dataset using the [!DNL Platform] UI or using a listing operation in the API. The dataset ID can be found on [Experience Platform](https://platform.adobe.com) by going to the **[!UICONTROL Datasets]** tab, clicking on the dataset you want the ID for, and copying the string from the dataset ID field on the **[!UICONTROL Info]** tab. See the [Catalog Service overview](../../catalog/home.md) for information on how to retrieve datasets using the API.

Instead of using an existing dataset, you can create a new dataset. Please read the [create a dataset using APIs](../../catalog/api/create-dataset.md) tutorial for more information on creating a dataset using APIs.

**Response**

A successful response returns an HTTP status 207 (Multi-status). Reviewing the response body provides more details into the success or failure of each method executed in the request. A response is returned for each element of the request messages array. Below is an example of a successful response with no message failures:

```json
{
    "inletId": "9b0cb233972f3b0092992284c7353f5eead496218e8441a79b25e9421ea127f5",
    "batchId": "1565628583792:1485:153",
    "receivedTimeMs": 1565628583854,
    "responses": [
        {
            "xactionId": "1565628583792:1485:153:0"
        },
        {
            "xactionId": "1565628583792:1485:153:1"
        }
    ]
}
```

For more information on status codes, please see the [response codes](#response-codes) table in the Appendix of this tutorial.

## Identify failed messages 

Compared to sending a request with a single message, when sending an HTTP request with multiple messages, there are additional factors to consider, such as: how to identify when data has failed to send, which specific messages failed to send and how they can be retrieved, and what happens to data that succeeds when other messages in the same request fail.

Before proceeding with this tutorial, it is recommended to first review the [retrieving failed batches](../quality/retrieve-failed-batches.md) guide.

### Send request payload with valid and invalid messages

The following example shows what happens when the batch includes valid and invalid messages.

The request payload is an array of JSON objects representing the event in XDM schema. Note that the following conditions needs to be met for successful validation of the message:
- The `imsOrgId` field in the message header has to match the inlet definition. If the request payload does not include an `imsOrgId` field, the [!DNL Data Collection Core Service] (DCCS) will add the field automatically.
- The header of the message should reference an existing XDM schema created in the [!DNL Platform] UI.
- The `datasetId` field needs to reference an existing dataset in [!DNL Platform], and its schema needs to match the schema provided in the `header` object within each message included in the request body.

**API format**

```http

| -------- | ----------- |
| `{CONNECTION_ID}` | The ID of the created Data inlet. |

**Response** 

The response payload includes a status for each message along with a GUID in the `xactionId` that can be used for tracing.

The example response above shows error messages for the previous request. By comparing this response to the previous valid response, you can observe that the request resulted in a partial success, with one message being ingested successfully and three messages resulting in failure. Note that both responses return a '207' status code. For more information on status codes, please see the [response codes](#response-codes) table in the Appendix of this tutorial.

The first message was successfully sent to [!DNL Platform] and is not affected by the results of the other messages. As a result, when attempting to resend the failed messages, you do not need to re-include this message.

The second message failed because it lacked a message body. The collection request expects message elements to have valid header and body sections. Adding the following code after the header in the second message will fix the request, allowing the second message to pass validation:

```JSON
      "body": {
        "xdmMeta": {
          "schemaRef": {
            "id": "https://ns.adobe.com/{TENANT_ID}/schemas/{SCHEMA_ID}",
            "contentType": "application/vnd.adobe.xed-full+json;{SCHEMA_VERSION}"
          }
        },
        "xdmEntity": {
          "_id": "9af5adcc-db9c-4692-b826-65d3abe68c22",
          "timestamp": "2019-02-23T22:07:01Z",
        }
    },
```

The third message failed due to an invalid organization ID being used in the header. The organization must match with the {CONNECTION_ID} that you are trying to post to. To determine which organization ID matches the streaming connection you are using, you can perform a `GET inlet` request using the [[!DNL Streaming Ingestion API]](https://developer.adobe.com/experience-platform-apis/references/streaming-ingestion/). See [retrieving a streaming connection](./create-streaming-connection.md#get-data-collection-url) for an example of how to retrieve previously created streaming connections. 

The fourth message failed because it did not follow the expected XDM schema. The `xdmSchema` included in the header and body of the request do not match the XDM schema of the `{DATASET_ID}`. Correcting the schema in the message header and body allows it to pass DCCS validation and be successfully sent to [!DNL Platform]. The message body must also be updated to match the XDM schema of the `{DATASET_ID}` for it to pass streaming validation on [!DNL Platform]. For more information on what happens to messages that successfully stream to Platform, see the [confirm messages ingested](#confirm-messages-ingested) section of this tutorial.

### Retrieve failed messages from [!DNL Platform]

Failed messages are identified by an error status code in the response array. 
The invalid messages are collected and stored in an "error" batch within the dataset specified by `{DATASET_ID}`.

Read the [retrieving failed batches](../quality/retrieve-failed-batches.md) guide for more information on recovering failed batch messages.

## Confirm messages ingested

Messages that pass DCCS validation are streamed to [!DNL Platform]. On [!DNL Platform], the batch messages are tested by streaming validation before being ingested into the [!DNL Data Lake]. The status of batches, whether successful or not, appear within the dataset specified by `{DATASET_ID}`.

You can view the status of batch messages that successfully stream to [!DNL Platform] using the [Experience Platform UI](https://platform.adobe.com) by going to the **[!UICONTROL Datasets]** tab, clicking on the dataset you are streaming to, and checking the **[!UICONTROL Dataset Activity]** tab.

Batch messages that pass streaming validation on [!DNL Platform] are ingested into the [!DNL Data Lake]. The messages are then available for analysis or export.

## Next steps

Now that you know how to send multiple messages in a single request and verify when messages are successfully ingested into the target dataset, you can start streaming your own data to [!DNL Platform]. For an overview of how to query and retrieve ingested data from [!DNL Platform], see the [[!DNL Data Access]](../../data-access/tutorials/dataset-data.md) guide.

### Response codes

The following table shows status codes returned by successful and failed response messages.

| Status code | Description |
| :---: | --- |
| 207  | Although '207' is used as the overall response status code, the recipient needs to consult the contents of the multi-status response body for further information about the success or failure of the method execution. The response code is used in success, partial success, and also in failure situations. |
| 400 | There was a problem with the request. See the response body for a more specific error message (For example, Message payload was missing required fields, or Message was unknown xdm format). |
| 401  | Unauthorized: request missing valid authorization header. This is only returned for inlets that have authentication enabled. |
| 403  | Unauthorized:  Provided authorization token is invalid or expired. This is only returned for inlets that have authentication enabled. |
| 413  | Payload too large - thrown when the total payload request is greater than 1MB. |
| 429  | Too many requests within specified time duration. |
| 500  | Error in processing payload. See the response body for a more specific error message (For example, Message payload schema not specified, or did not match the XDM definition in [!DNL Platform]). |
| 503  | Service is not currently available. Clients should retry at least 3 times using an exponential back-off strategy. |
