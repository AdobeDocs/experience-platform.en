# Map a CSV file to an XDM schema using AI-generated recommendations

>[!NOTE]
>
>For information on generally available CSV mapping capabilities in Platform, see the document on [mapping a CSV file to an existing schema](./existing-schema.md).

In order to ingest CSV data into [!DNL Adobe Experience Platform], the data must be mapped to an [!DNL Experience Data Model] (XDM) schema. You can choose to map to [an existing schema](./existing-schema.md), but if you do not know exactly which schema to use or how it should be structured, you can instead use dynamic recommendations based on machine-learning (ML) models within the Platform UI.

## Getting started

This tutorial requires a working understanding of the following components of [!DNL Platform]:

* [[!DNL Experience Data Model (XDM System)]](../../../xdm/home.md): The standardized framework by which [!DNL Platform] organizes customer experience data.
    * At a minimum, you must understand the concept of [behaviors in XDM](../../../xdm/home.md#data-behaviors), so you can decide whether to map your data to a [!UICONTROL Profile] class (record behavior) or [!UICONTROL ExperienceEvent] class (time-series behavior).
* [Batch ingestion](../../batch-ingestion/overview.md): The method by which [!DNL Platform] ingests data from user-supplied datafiles.
* [Adobe Experience Platform Data Prep](../../batch-ingestion/overview.md): A suite of capabilities that allow you to map and transform ingested data to conform to XDM schemas. The documentation on [Data Prep functions](../../../data-prep/functions.md) is specifically relevant for schema mapping.

## Provide dataflow details

In the Experience Platform UI, select **[!UICONTROL Sources]** in the left navigation. On the **[!UICONTROL Catalog]** view, navigate to the **[!UICONTROL Local system]** category. Under **[!UICONTROL Local file upload]**, select **[!UICONTROL Add data]**.

![The [!UICONTROL Sources] catalog in the Platform UI, with [!UICONTROL Add data] under [!UICONTROL Local file upload] being selected.](../../images/tutorials/map-csv-recommendations/local-file-upload.png)

The **[!UICONTROL Map CSV XDM schema]** workflow appears, starting on the **[!UICONTROL Dataflow detail]** step.

Select **[!UICONTROL Create a new schema using ML recommendations]**, causing new controls to appear. Choose the appropriate class for the CSV data you want to map ([!UICONTROL Profile] or [!UICONTROL ExperienceEvent]). You can optionally use the dropdown menu to select the relevant industry for your business, or leave it blank if the provided categories do not apply to you. If your organization operates under a [business-to-business (B2B)](../../../xdm/tutorials/relationship-b2b.md) model, select the **[!UICONTROL B2B data]** checkbox.

![The [!UICONTROL Dataflow detail] step with the ML recommendation option selected. [!UICONTROL Profile] is selected for the class and [!UICONTROL Telecommunications] selected for the industry](../../images/tutorials/map-csv-recommendations/select-class-and-industry.png)

From here, provide a name for the schema that will be created from the CSV data, and a name for the output dataset that will contain the data ingested under that schema.

You can optionally configure the following additional features for the dataflow before proceeding:

| Input name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [!UICONTROL Description] | A description for the dataflow. |
| [!UICONTROL Error diagnostics] | When enabled, error messages are generated for newly ingested batches, which can be viewed when fetching the corresponding batch in the [API](../../batch-ingestion/api-overview.md). |
| [!UICONTROL Partial ingestion] | When enabled, valid records for new batch data will be ingested within a specified error threshold. This threshold allows you to configure the percentage of acceptable errors before the entire batch fails. |
| [!UICONTROL Dataflow details] | Provide a name and optional description for the dataflow that will bring the CSV data into Platform. The dataflow is automatically assigned a default name when starting this workflow. Changing the name is optional. |
| [!UICONTROL Alerts] | Select from a list of [in-product alerts](../../../observability/alerts/overview.md) that you want to receive regarding the status of the dataflow once it has been initiated. |

When you are finished configuring the dataflow, select **[!UICONTROL Next]**.

![The [!UICONTROL Dataflow detail] section is completed.](../../images/tutorials/map-csv-recommendations/dataflow-detail-complete.png)

## Select data

On the **[!UICONTROL Select data]** step, use the left column to upload your CSV file. You can select **[!UICONTROL Choose files]** to open a file explorer dialog to select the file from, or you can drag and drop the file onto the column directly.

![The [!UICONTROL Choose files] button and drag-and-drop area highlighted within the [!UICONTROL Select data] step.](../../images/tutorials/map-csv-recommendations/upload-files.png)

After uploading the file, a sample data section appears that shows the first ten rows of the received data so you can verify it has uploaded correctly. Select **[!UICONTROL Next]** to continue.

![Sample data rows are populated within the workspace](../../images/tutorials/map-csv-recommendations/data-uploaded.png)

## Configure schema mappings

The ML models are run to generate a new schema based on your dataflow configuration and your uploaded CSV file. When the process is complete, the [!UICONTROL Mapping] step populates to show the mappings for each individual field alongside fully navigable view of the generated schema structure.

>[!NOTE]

>You can filter all fields in your schema based on a variety of criteria during the source-to-target field mapping workflow. The default behavior is to display all mapped fields. To change the displayed fields, select the filter icon next to the search input field and choose from the dropdown options.<br> ![The mapping stage fo the CSV to XDM schema creation workflow with teh filter icon and dropdown menu highlighted.](../../images/tutorials/map-csv-recommendations/source-field-to-target-mapping-filter.png "The mapping stage fo the CSV to XDM schema creation workflow with teh filter icon and dropdown menu highlighted."){width="100" zoomable="yes"}

From here, you can optionally [edit the field mappings](#edit-mappings) or [alter the field groups they are associated with](#edit-schema) according to your needs. When satisfied, select **[!UICONTROL Finish]** to complete the mapping and initiate the dataflow you configured earlier. The CSV data is ingested into the system and populates a dataset based on the generated schema structure, ready to be consumed by downstream Platform services.

![The [!UICONTROL Finish] button being selected, completing the CSV mapping process.](../../images/tutorials/map-csv-recommendations/finish-mapping.png)

### Edit field mappings {#edit-mappings}

Use the field mapping preview to edit existing mappings or remove them entirely. For more information on how to manage a mapping set in the UI, refer to the [UI guide for Data Prep mapping](../../../data-prep/ui/mapping.md#mapping-interface).

### Edit field groups {#edit-field-groups}

The CSV fields are automatically mapped to existing XDM field groups using ML models. If you want to change the field group for any particular CSV field, select **[!UICONTROL Edit]** next to the schema tree.

![The [!UICONTROL Edit] button being selected next to the schema tree.](../../images/tutorials/map-csv-recommendations/edit-schema-structure.png)

A dialog appears, allowing you to edit the display name, data type, and field group for any field in the mapping. Select the edit icon (![Edit icon](../../images/tutorials/map-csv-recommendations/edit-icon.png)) next to a source field to edit its details in the right column before selecting **[!UICONTROL Apply]**.

When you are finished adjusting the schema recommendations for your source fields, select **[!UICONTROL Save]** to apply the changes.

## Next steps

This guide covered how to map a CSV file to an XDM schema using AI-generated recommendations, allowing you to bring that data into Platform through batch ingestion.
