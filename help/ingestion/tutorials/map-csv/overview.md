# Map a CSV file to an XDM schema

In order to ingest CSV data into [!DNL Adobe Experience Platform], the data must be mapped to an [!DNL Experience Data Model] (XDM) schema. The following tutorials cover how to map CSV files to XDM schemas using the [!DNL Platform] user interface:

* [Map a CSV file to an existing XDM schema](./existing-schema.md)
* [Map a CSV file to a new XDM schema using AI-generated recommendations](./recommendations.md)

>[!TIP]
>
>You can also use Machine Learning (ML) algorithms to **generate a schema from sample CSV data**. This workflow automatically creates a new schema based on the structure and content of your CSV file. This newly created schema matches your data's format to save you time and increase accuracy when defining the structure, fields, and data types for large complex datasets. See the [ML-Assisted schema creation guide](../../../xdm/ui/ml-assisted-schema-creation.md) for more information on this workflow.
