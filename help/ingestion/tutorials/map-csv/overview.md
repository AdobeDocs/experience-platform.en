# Map a CSV file to an XDM schema

In order to ingest CSV data into [!DNL Adobe Experience Platform], the data must be mapped to an [!DNL Experience Data Model] (XDM) schema. The following tutorials cover how to map CSV files to XDM schemas using the [!DNL Platform] user interface:

* [Map a CSV file to an existing XDM schema](./existing-schema.md)
* [Map a CSV file to a new XDM schema using AI-generated recommendations](./recommendations.md) (currently in beta)
