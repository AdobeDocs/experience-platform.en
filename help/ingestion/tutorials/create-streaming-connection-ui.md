# Create a streaming connection using the UI

In order to start streaming data to [!DNL Experience Platform], you must first create a streaming HTTP connection. When creating a streaming connection, you need to provide key details such as the source of streaming data, and whether or not you intend to send data from a trusted (authenticated) or an untrusted (unauthenticated) source.

After registering a streaming connection you will have a unique URL which can be used to stream data to [!DNL Experience Platform].

To learn how to create a streaming connection, please read the [HTTP API source UI guide](../../sources/tutorials/ui/create/streaming/http.md).
