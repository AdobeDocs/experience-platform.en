# Creating a streaming connection using the API

Streaming connection registration is required in order to start streaming data to Adobe Experience Platform. When registering a streaming connection, you need to provide some key details like the source of streaming data.

After registering a streaming connection, you, as the data producer, will have a unique URL which can be used to stream data to Platform.

To learn how to create an authenticated streaming connection, please read the [HTTP API source API guide](../../sources/tutorials/api/create/streaming/http.md).
