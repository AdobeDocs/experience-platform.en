# Weather data field mappings

Adobe has partnered with [!DNL [The Weather Company]](https://www.ibm.com/weather) to bring the additional context of United States weather to the data collected via datastreams. You can use this data for analytics, targeting and segment creation in Experience Platform.

This page lists all the available fields that you can use to enrich your audience data.

The fields are broken up into three different groups that align to the field groups. 

* [**[!UICONTROL Current Weather]**](#current-weather): The current weather conditions of the user, based on their location. This include current temperature, percipitation, cloud coverage, and more.
* [**[!UICONTROL Forecasted Weather]**](#forecast): The forecast includes the 1,2,3,5,7 and 10 day forecast for the user location.
* [**[!UICONTROL Triggers]**](#triggers): Triggers are specific combinations that map to different semantic weather conditions. There are three different types of weather triggers:

    * **[!UICONTROL Relative Triggers]**: Semantically meaningful conditions, such as cold or rainy weather. These can differ in their definitions between various climates.
    * **[!UICONTROL Product Triggers]**: Conditions that would lead to the purchase of different types of products. For example: cold weather forecasts could mean that purchases of rain coats are more likely. 
    * **[!UICONTROL Severe Weather Triggers]**: Severe weather warnings, like winter storm or hurricane warnings.

| [!UICONTROL Day 14 Forecast Wind Speed Kilometers per Hour] | Weather forecast for fourteen days. The forecast of the maximum sustained wind speed over the 12 hour forecast period.<br>The wind is treated as a vector; hence, winds must have direction and magnitude (speed). The wind information reported in the forecast corresponds to a 10-minute average called the sustained wind speed. Sudden or brief variations in the wind speed are known as "wind gusts" and are reported in a separate data field. Wind directions are always expressed as "from whence the wind blows" meaning that a North wind blows from North to South. If you face North in a North wind the wind is at your face. Face southward and the North wind is at your back. Wind speed in kilometers per hour  | `weather.forecast.day14Forecast.windSpeed.kilometersPerHour` |

## Triggers {#triggers}

Triggers define semantic weather condition based on various inputs. 

| Field | Description | XDM path |  
| --- | ---- | --- |
| [!UICONTROL Product Triggers] | Indicates when conditions are suitable for driving sales for certain categories of products.  They are mapped to integer itendities. A full list can be obtained from IBM.  | `weather.productTriggers` |
| [!UICONTROL Relative Triggers] | Relative conditions based on human perception. Things like Hot or Cold. They are mapped to integer itendities. A full list can be obtained from IBM.  | `weather.relativeTriggers` |
| [!UICONTROL Severe Weather Triggers] | Indicates various severe weather conditions like Hurricanes or excessive rain. | `weather.severeTriggers` |
