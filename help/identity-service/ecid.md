# ECID overview

Experience Cloud ID (ECID) is a shared identity namespace used across Adobe Experience Platform and Adobe Experience Cloud applications.

ECID provides the foundation for customer identity. With the context of [[!DNL Identity Service]](./home.md), ECID is used as the primary ID for devices and as a base node for identity graphs.

With ECID, you can:

* Add a people-centric context to identities, allowing you to market to real people as opposed to devices.
* Provide synchronization with partners.
* Feed pairwise links to connect with offline or other IDs to the graph.

Identifying your online users requires instrumentizing your site or mobile app with ECID, which provides a universal and persistent ID that identifies your visitors across all applications in Adobe Experience Cloud.

## Next steps and additional resources

The following documentation provides further resources on understanding ECID across different Platform and Experience Cloud applications:

* To use ECID with website implementation, see the documentation for [Experience Cloud Identity Service](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/id-service/using/home.html).
* To see how ECID is used with apps and mobile web content, see the documentation for [visitor tracking between an app and mobile web](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/mobile-services/ios/sdk-reference-ios/hybrid-app.html#sdk-reference-ios).
* Deploying these tools can be simple and easy to manage if you use [tags](../tags/home.md).
* See the [Privacy Service documentation](../privacy-service/identity-data.md) for information on using ECID to facilitate compliance with privacy regulations like GDPR.
* For more information on ECID with the context of Platform, see the [Identity Service overview](./home.md) and the [identity namespaces overview](./namespaces.md).
