# ECID overview

The [!DNL Experience Cloud Identity Service] (ECID) is the client side module providing access to identity management, serving three primary functions:

- Identify each visitor
- Provide synchronization with Partners
- Feed pairwise links to connect with offline or other IDs to the graph

Identifying your online users requires instrumentizing your site or mobile app with the ECID, which provides a universal and persistent ID that identifies your visitors across all solutions in Adobe Experience Platform.
 
If you are working with a website implementation, explore the resources [here](https://docs.adobe.com/content/help/en/id-service/using/home.html).

If you are working with a mobile app, see how ECID is used to [track visitors between an app and mobile web](https://docs.adobe.com/content/help/en/mobile-services/ios/sdk-reference-ios/hybrid-app.html).

Deploying these tools can be simple and easy to manage if you use [Adobe Launch](https://docs.adobe.com/content/help/en/launch/using/overview.html).

Also, see the [Privacy Service documentation](../privacy-service/identity-data.md) for information on using ECID for GDPR compliance.
