# Guardrails for [!DNL Identity Service] data

This document provides information on use and rate limits for [!DNL Identity Service] data to help you optimize your use of the identity graph. When reviewing the following guardrails, it is assumed that you have modeled the data correctly. If you have questions on how to model your data, please contact your customer service representative.

## Getting started

The following Experience Platform services are involved with modeling Identity data: 

* [Identities](home.md): Bridge identities from disparate data sources as they are ingested into Platform.
* [[!DNL Real-time Customer Profile]](../profile/home.md): Create unified consumer profiles using data from multiple sources.

## Data model limits

| Guardrail | Limit | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Number of identities in a graph | 150 | The identity graph will not be updated once the limit is reached. |
| Number of identities in an XDM record | 20 | The minimum number of XDM records required is two. |
| Number of custom namespaces | None | There are no limits to the number of custom namespaces you can create. |
| Number of graphs | None | There are no limits to the number of identity graphs you can create. |

## Next steps

See the following documentation for more information on [!DNL Identity Service]:

* [[!DNL Identity Service] overview](home.md)
