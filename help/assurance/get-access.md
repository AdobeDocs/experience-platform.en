User access is changing

As we transition from beta (Project Griffon) to being generally available (as Assurance) to all Adobe Experience Cloud customers - access to Project Griffon / Assurance is changing. Access to Assurance will be managed through the [Admin Console](https://helpx.adobe.com/enterprise/using/admin-console.html)

## Access setup

Your company's Adobe Experience Cloud administrator will be able to help and perform the following changes.

To receive or to maintain uninterrupted access to Assurance, ensure that the following steps are completed in the Admin Console:

### Create a product profile

Log into the [Admin Console](https://adminconsole.adobe.com/)
1. Create a new Adobe Experience Platform product profile
2. Select the **Products** tab, then select the Adobe Experience Platform product card. Note: You may use an existing profile and skip this step.

### Add users to the product profile

Provide a name and select **Save**.
The product profile you intend to use for Assurance access does not require any additional permissions; the default with settings with no extra selections are sufficient.
