# User access

>[!WARNING]
>
>Please note that user access to Assurance is changing. As Assurance leaves beta (Project Griffon) to being generally available (as Assurance) to all Adobe Experience Cloud customers - access to Assurance will be managed through the [Admin Console](https://helpx.adobe.com/enterprise/using/admin-console.html).
>
>If you need assistance, please contact your company's Adobe Experience Cloud administrator.

To receive or to maintain uninterrupted access to Assurance, ensure that the following steps are completed in the Admin Console:

## Create a product profile

>[!NOTE]
>
>If you are using an existing profile, you can skip to the next section.

Log into the [Admin Console](https://adminconsole.adobe.com/) and create a new Adobe Experience Platform product profile. 

Select the **Products** tab, followed by the Adobe Experience Platform product card.
