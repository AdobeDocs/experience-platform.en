# Places Service view in Assurance

The **[!UICONTROL Places]** view allow you to inspect location entry and exit events on the Adobe Experience Platform Assurance web UI and provides an innovative on-device view. Depending on your business workflows, these handy views provide a convenient interface to display location-specific data points for inspection on the web/client for in-context debugging.

We know that using location context with your app experiences can make them more engaging. However, debugging and validating location triggers can be painful. Using these views and reviewing the data that you collect on the device helps alleviate that pain.

To get started, complete the following steps:

1. [Set up Assurance](../tutorials/implement-assurance.md).
2. To view your events, from the left side menu select the **Events view** under the **Places Service** section.
