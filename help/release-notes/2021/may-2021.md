|Widget creation & management| All standard and custom widgets are accessible to marketers in a centralized repository for democratizing insights creation and sharing:<br/><ul><li>The standard tab contains Adobe-provided widgets accessible within the dashboard context. </li><li>The custom tab contains custom widgets created by the organization including an option to hide widgets from view.</li><li>Widget creation workflow within Profiles and Audience insights enables editing, selection, preview, and publishing of custom widgets.</li></ul>|
|Custom insights| Access permissions enable data engineers and marketing specialists to customize profile attributes that are available for widget creation.|

For more information on dashboards, including how to grant access permissions and create custom widgets, begin by reading the [dashboards overview](../../dashboards/home.md).

## [!DNL Data Prep] {#data-prep}

[!DNL Data Prep] allows data engineers to map, transform, and validate data to and from Experience Data Model (XDM).

| Feature | Description |
| ------- | ----------- |
| Lenient error warnings | Data Prep Mapper error messages will now be more lenient, by providing warnings instead of errors along with partially transformed rows. |
| New functions | Added functions to get keys, append elements to an existing array, append elements of multiple arrays to an existing array, use objects to build arrays, and use the name of the JSON object as a string literal. | 

For more information, please see the [[!DNL Data Prep] overview](../../data-prep/home.md).

## [!DNL Destinations] {#destinations}

[!DNL Destinations] are pre-built integrations with destination platforms that allow for the seamless activation of data from Adobe Experience Platform. You can use destinations to activate your known and unknown data for cross-channel marketing campaigns, email campaigns, targeted advertising, and many other use cases.

| Feature | Description |
| ------- | ----------- |
| Improved monitoring (beta) | Increased the capabilities of monitoring for destinations, including information for both batch and streaming destinations |

For more general information on destinations, refer to the [destinations overview](../../destinations/home.md).

## [!DNL Experience Data Model (XDM)] {#xdm}

Experience Data Model (XDM) is an open-source specification that is designed to improve the power of digital experiences. It provides common structures and definitions for any application to communicate with services on Adobe Experience Platform. By adhering to XDM standards, all customer experience data can be incorporated into a common representation to deliver insights in a faster, more integrated way. You can gain valuable insights from customer actions, define customer audiences through segments, and use customer attributes for personalization purposes.

| Feature | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Schema field groups | The term "mixin" has been updated to "field group". This change is reflected across the Adobe Experience Platform UI. In addition, the Schema Registry API has a new [field groups endpoint](../../xdm/api/field-groups.md), while the mixins endpoint has been deprecated as a legacy endpoint. See the [XDM documentation](../../xdm/home.md) for more information. |

## Real-Time Customer Profile {#profile}

Adobe Experience Platform enables you to drive coordinated, consistent, and relevant experiences for your customers no matter where or when they interact with your brand. With Real-Time Customer Profile, you can see a holistic view of each individual customer that combines data from multiple channels, including online, offline, CRM, and third party data. [!DNL Profile] allows you to consolidate customer data into a unified view offering an actionable, timestamped account of every customer interaction.

| Feature | Description |
| ------- | ----------- |
|Dataset overlap report| The dataset overlap report provides visibility into the composition of the Profile store by exposing the datasets that contribute most to addressable audience. In addition to providing insights into Profile data, this report helps users take actions to optimize license usage, such as setting a limit to the lifespan of certain data. To learn more, follow the tutorial on [generating the dataset overlap report](../../profile/tutorials/dataset-overlap-report.md).|

For more information on Real-Time Customer Profile, including tutorials and best practices for working with [!DNL Profile] data, please begin by reading the [Real-Time Customer Profile overview](../../profile/home.md).

## [!DNL Sandboxes] {#sandboxes}

Adobe Experience Platform is built to enrich digital experience applications on a global scale. Companies often run multiple digital experience applications in parallel and need to cater for the development, testing, and deployment of these applications while ensuring operational compliance. In order to address this need, Experience Platform provides sandboxes which partition a single Platform instance into separate virtual environments to help develop and evolve digital experience applications.

| Feature | Description |
| ------- | ----------- |
| Multiple production sandboxes | You can now create and manage multiple production sandboxes in your IMS Org and dedicate specific production sandboxes to distinct lines of business, brands, projects or regions. See the tutorials on creating a production sandbox [in the UI](../../sandboxes/ui/user-guide.md) or [using the API](../../sandboxes/api/overview.md) for more information. |

### Known limitations

- Every Experience Cloud Organization comes with a pre-created default production sandbox. This sandbox acts as a default destination for every request sent to Platform from another Adobe application or non-Adobe application that is not (yet) Sandbox-compliant. The default production sandbox cannot be reset if the identity graph hosted within it is also being used by Adobe Analytics for the [Cross Device Analytics (CDA)](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/analytics/components/cda/overview.html) feature, or if the identity graph hosted within it is also being used by Adobe Audience Manager for the [People Based Destinations (PBD)](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/audience-manager/user-guide/features/destinations/people-based/people-based-destinations-overview.html) feature.
- Production sandboxes that are used for bi-directional segment sharing with Adobe Audience Manager or Audience Core Service can neither be reset nor deleted.
- All user-created production and development sandboxes can be deleted, except the default production sandbox.

For more information on sandboxes, see the [sandboxes overview](../../sandboxes/home.md).

## [!DNL Sources] {#sources}

Adobe Experience Platform can ingest data from external sources while allowing you to structure, label, and enhance that data using Platform services. You can ingest data from a variety of sources such as Adobe applications, cloud-based storage, third-party software, and your CRM system.

Experience Platform provides a RESTful API and an interactive UI that lets you set up source connections for various data providers with ease. These source connections allow you to authenticate and connect to external storage systems and CRM services, set times for ingestion runs, and manage data ingestion throughput.

| Feature | Description |
| ------- | ----------- |
| UI support for compressed file ingestion | You can now preview and ingest compressed JSON or delimited files using cloud storage sources in the UI. For more information, see the tutorial on [configuring a dataflow for a cloud storage source connection in the UI](../../sources/tutorials/ui/dataflow/batch/cloud-storage.md). |
| Beta sources moving to GA | The following sources have been promoted from beta to GA: <ul><li>[[!DNL Azure File Storage]](../../sources/connectors/cloud-storage/azure-file-storage.md)</li><li>[[!DNL Azure Synapse Analytics]](../../sources/connectors/databases/synapse-analytics.md)</li><li>[[!DNL Greenplum]](../../sources/connectors/databases/greenplum.md)</li><li>[[!DNL HubSpot]](../../sources/connectors/marketing-automation/hubspot.md)</li><li>[[!DNL ServiceNow]](../../sources/connectors/customer-success/servicenow.md)</li></ul> |
