**Release date: November 17, 2021**

## Updates to existing features

Updates to existing features in Adobe Experience Platform:

- [Attribution AI](#attribution-ai)
- [Customer AI](#customer-ai)

### Attribution AI {#attribution-ai}

Attribution AI is used to attribute credits to touchpoints leading to conversion events. This can be used by marketers to help quantify the marketing impact of each individual marketing touchpoint across customer journeys.

| Feature | Description |
| ------- | ----------- |
| Support for multiple datasets | Attribution AI can now easily ingest multiple datasets directly in the UI without the need to map and stitch data. This new time savings capability provides more powerful and accurate scores with richer data from the multiple datasets. |

For more information on Attribution AI, please see the [Attribution AI documentation](../../intelligent-services/attribution-ai/overview.md).

### Customer AI {#customer-ai}

Customer AI available in Real-time Customer Data Platform, is used to generate custom propensity scores such as churn and conversion for individual profiles at-scale. This is accomplished without having to transform the business needs to a machine learning problem, pick an algorithm, train, or deploy.

**Updated features**

| Feature | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Support for multiple datasets | Customer AI can now easily ingest multiple datasets directly in the UI without the need to map and stitch each dataset. This new time savings capability provides more powerful and accurate scores with richer data from the multiple datasets. |
| Custom profile attributes | Customer AI now supports defining custom profile dataset fields (with timestamps) in your data in addition to standard event fields. Using this option allows you to add additional profile attributes that you deem influential which may improve the quality of your model and provide more accurate results |
