# Adobe Experience Platform release notes 

**Release date: September 28, 2022**

Updates to existing features in Adobe Experience Platform:

- [Identity Service](#identity-service)
- [Sources](#sources)

## Identity Service {#identity-service}

Delivering relevant digital experiences requires having a complete understanding of your customer. This is made more difficult when your customer data is fragmented across disparate systems, causing each customer to appear to have multiple "identities".

Adobe Experience Platform Identity Service helps you gain a better view of your customer and their behavior by bridging identities across devices and systems, allowing you to deliver impactful, personal digital experiences in real time.

**Updated features**

| Feature | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Support for dataset deletion | Identity Service now supports dataset deletion when requesting through the [Catalog Service API](https://developer.adobe.com/experience-platform-apis/references/catalog/), UI, or Data Hygiene. Read the guide on [deleting datasets in the UI](../../catalog/datasets/user-guide.md#delete-a-dataset) for more information. |

To learn more about Identity Service, read the [Identity Service overview](../../identity-service/home.md).

## Sources {#sources}

Adobe Experience Platform can ingest data from external sources while allowing you to structure, label, and enhance that data using Platform services. You can ingest data from a variety of sources such as Adobe applications, cloud-based storage, third-party software, and your CRM system.

Experience Platform provides a RESTful API and an interactive UI that lets you set up source connections for various data providers with ease. These source connections allow you to authenticate and connect to external storage systems and CRM services, set times for ingestion runs, and manage data ingestion throughput.

**Updated features**

| Feature | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Audience Manager segment population impact on Real-time Customer Profile | The ingestion of sizeable Audience Manager segment populations has a direct impact on your total profile count when you first send an Audience Manager segment to Platform using the Audience Manager source. This means that selecting all segments can potentially lead to a Profile count in excess of your license usage entitlement. For more information, read the [Audience Manager source overview](../../sources/connectors/adobe-applications/audience-manager.md). For information on your license usage, read the documentation on [using the license usage dashboard](../../dashboards/guides/license-usage.md). |
