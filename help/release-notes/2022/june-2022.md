# Adobe Experience Platform release notes 

**Release date: June 22, 2022**

Updates to existing features in Adobe Experience Platform:

- [[!DNL Data Science Workspace]](#dsw)
- [[!DNL Destinations]](#destinations)
- [Data collection](#data-collection)
- [Experience Data Model (XDM)](#xdm)
- [Query Service](#query-service)

## [!DNL Data Science Workspace] {#dsw}

Data Science Workspace uses machine learning and artificial intelligence to unleash insights from your data. Integrated into Adobe Experience Platform, Data Science Workspace helps you make predictions using your content and data assets across Adobe solutions. One of the ways Data Science Workspace accomplishes this is through the use of JupyterLab. JupyterLab is a web-based user interface for <a href="https://jupyter.org/" target="_blank">Project Jupyter</a> and is tightly integrated into Adobe Experience Platform. It provides an interactive development environment for data scientists to work with Jupyter notebooks, code, and data.

| Feature | Description |
| --- | --- |
| JupyterLab Launcher | The JupyterLab Launcher now includes starters for Spark 3.2 notebooks. Spark 2.4 notebook starters are now replaced by Spark 3.2 notebooks and will be a part of this release. |
| Spark 3.2 | New Scala (Spark) and PySpark recipes now use Spark 3.2 |
| Kernels | Scala (Spark) notebooks are now authored via the Scala kernel. PySpark notebooks are now authored via the Python Kernel. The Spark and PySpark kernel are deprecated and set to be removed in a subsequent release. |
| Recipes | New PySpark and Spark recipes now follow the Docker workflow similar to Python and R recipes. |

## [!DNL Destinations] {#destinations}

[!DNL Destinations] are pre-built integrations with destination platforms that allow for the seamless activation of data from Adobe Experience Platform. You can use destinations to activate your known and unknown data for cross-channel marketing campaigns, email campaigns, targeted advertising, and many other use cases.

**New or updated features**

| Feature | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| (Beta) Destination SDK support for [[!DNL Google Cloud Storage]](../../destinations/destination-sdk/functionality/destination-server/server-specs.md#gcs-example) file-based destinations and [configurable file names](../../destinations/destination-sdk/functionality/destination-configuration/batch-configuration.md#file-name-configuration). | You can now use the Destination SDK to create Google Cloud Storage destinations and define custom file names for exported files, via file name macros. <br><br> File-based destination support in Adobe Experience Platform Destination SDK is currently in Beta. The documentation and functionality are subject to change.|
| Segment column in dataflow runs to batch destinations | For dataflow runs to batch destinations, the UI now displays the name of the segment associated with each dataflow run. Read more about [dataflow runs to batch destinations](../../dataflows/ui/monitor-destinations.md#dataflow-runs-for-batch-destinations). |

For more general information on destinations, refer to the [destinations overview](../../destinations/home.md).

## Data collection {#data-collection}

Adobe Experience Platform provides a suite of technologies that allow you to collect client-side customer experience data and send it to the Adobe Experience Platform Edge Network where it can be enriched, transformed, and distributed to Adobe or non-Adobe destinations.

**New features**

| Feature | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [Access Type configuration for datastreams](../../datastreams/overview.md#create)| When creating a new datastream, you can now select what type of requests you want the Edge Network to accept: <ul><li>**[!UICONTROL Mixed Authentication]**: When this option is selected, the Edge Network accepts both authenticated and unauthenticated requests. Select this option when you plan to use the Web SDK or [Mobile SDK](https://developer.adobe.com/client-sdks/documentation/), along with the [Server API](../../server-api/overview.md). </li><li>**[!UICONTROL Authenticated Only]**: When this option is selected, the Edge Network only accepts authenticated requests. Select this option when you plan to use only the Server API and want to prevent any unauthenticated requests from being processed by the [!DNL Edge Network]. </li></ul> |
|[Render propositions](../../edge/personalization/rendering-personalization-content.md#applypropositions) in single-page applications without incrementing metrics. | The newly added `applyPropositions` command allows you to render or execute an array of propositions from [!DNL Target] into single-page applications, without incrementing the [!DNL Analytics] and [!DNL Target] metrics. This increases reporting accuracy. |
|[Mobile-to-web and cross-domain ID sharing](../../edge/identity/id-sharing.md) | The Adobe Experience Platform Web SDK now supports visitor ID sharing capabilities that enable you to deliver personalized experiences more accurately, between mobile apps and mobile web content, and across domains. |

| [Mailchimp event forwarding extension](../../tags/extensions/server/mailchimp/overview.md) | The Mailchimp event forwarding extension sends events to the Mailchimp Marketing API that can trigger emails for Mailchimp marketing campaigns, journeys, or transactions. |

For more information, please see the [data collection overview](../../collection/home.md).

## Experience Data Model (XDM) {#xdm}

XDM is an open-source specification that provides common structures and definitions (schemas) for data that is brought into Adobe Experience Platform. By adhering to XDM standards, all customer experience data can be incorporated into a common representation to deliver insights in a faster, more integrated way. You can gain valuable insights from customer actions, define customer audiences through segments, and use customer attributes for personalization purposes.

For more information on XDM in Platform, see the [XDM System overview](../../xdm/home.md).

## Query Service {#query-service}

Query Service allows you to use standard SQL to query data in Adobe Experience Platform [!DNL Data Lake]. You can join any datasets from the [!DNL Data Lake] and capture the query results as a new dataset for use in reporting, Data Science Workspace, or for ingestion into Real-Time Customer Profile.

**Updated features**

| Feature | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Ad hoc schema labeling | Manage access to sensitive data by applying labels to data fields of ad hoc schemas that are automatically generated through Query Service CTAS queres. You can restrict the usage of certain fields, or datasets, of ad hoc schemas to control access to both sensitive personal data and personally identifiable information. By using the attribute-based access control capability you can you label ad hoc schema fields through the Platform UI. |
| `FLATTEN` setting | When connecting to a database through third-party BI tools, the `FLATTEN` setting flattens nested data structures into separate columns where the attribute name becomes the column name that holds the row values. This improves the usability of ad hoc schemas and reduces the required workload to retrieve, analyze, transform and report data in BI tools that do not support nested data structures. |

{style="table-layout:auto"}

For more information on Query Services, refer to the [Query Service overview](../../query-service/home.md).

## Sources {#sources}

Adobe Experience Platform can ingest data from external sources while allowing you to structure, label, and enhance that data using Platform services. You can ingest data from a variety of sources such as Adobe applications, cloud-based storage, third-party software, and your CRM system.

Experience Platform provides a RESTful API and an interactive UI that lets you set up source connections for various data providers with ease. These source connections allow you to authenticate and connect to external storage systems and CRM services, set times for ingestion runs, and manage data ingestion throughput.

| Feature | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Beta release of [!DNL Mixpanel] source | You can now use the [!DNL Mixpanel] source to ingest analytics data from your [!DNL Mixpanel] account to Experience Platform. See the [[!DNL Mixpanel] source documentation](../../sources/connectors/analytics/mixpanel.md) for more information. |
