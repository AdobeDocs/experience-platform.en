## Audit Logs {#audit-logs}

Experience Platform allows you to audit user activity for various services and capabilities. The audit logs provide information about who did what and when.

**New features**

| Feature | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Audit logs for Dataset, Schema, Class, Field group, Data type, Sandbox, Destination, Segment, Merge policy, Computed attribute, Product profile and Account (Adobe) | These are the resources which are recorded by audit logs. If the feature is enabled, the audit logs will be automatically collected as activity occurs. You do not need to manually enable log collection. |

## Related accounts in Real-Time CDP B2B Edition {#related-accounts}

>[!NOTE]
>
>The Related accounts feature is available for customers of the Real-Time CDP B2B Edition only.

B2B enterprises often have their customer information stored in multiple systems, each including only partial or even conflicting data for the same real-world business entity. This creates a massive challenge of arriving at an accurate view of their customers, therefore reducing the efficiency and effectiveness of their B2B marketing and sales efforts. With the release of related accounts, [!DNL Real-Time CDP B2B] now shows you a list of accounts that are similar to the account you are browsing. You can include the related accounts in your segment definitions to broaden your reach or apply wider criteria in your segments. 

Read more about the feature in the following documentation pages:

- [Related accounts in Real-Time CDP B2B Edition overview](../../rtcdp/b2b-ai-ml-services/related-accounts.md)
- [Related accounts tab in the Account profile UI guide](../../rtcdp/accounts/account-profile-ui-guide.md#related-accounts-tab)
- [How to use related accounts in segment definitions](../../rtcdp/segmentation/b2b.md#related-accounts)

To learn more about Real-Time CDP B2B Edition, see the [overview](../../rtcdp/overview.md).

## Alerts {#alerts}

Experience Platform allows you to subscribe to event-based alerts for various Platform activities. You can subscribe to different alert rules through the [!UICONTROL Alerts] tab in the Platform user interface, and can choose to receive alert messages within the UI itself or through email notifications.

**Updated features**

| Feature | Description |
| --- | --- |
| New alert rules | Two new alert rules are now available for sources related to data ingestion. See the overview on [alert rules](../../observability/alerts/rules.md) for the updated list of alert types. |
