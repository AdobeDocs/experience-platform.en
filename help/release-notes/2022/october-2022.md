# Adobe Experience Platform release notes 

**Release date: October 26, 2022**

- [Query Service](#query-service)

## Query Service {#query-service}

Query Service allows you to use standard SQL to query data in Adobe Experience Platform [!DNL Data Lake]. You can join any datasets from the [!DNL Data Lake] and capture the query results as a new dataset for use in reporting, Data Science Workspace, or for ingestion into Real-time Customer Profile.

**Updated features**

| Feature | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Monitor queries through the Platform UI | The Query Service [!UICONTROL Scheduled Queries] tab provides improved visibility for the status of all query jobs through the UI. You can now find important information about the status of your query runs, including error messages and codes should they fail, from [!UICONTROL Scheduled Queries] tab. You can also subscribe to alerts through the UI for any of these queries based on their status. See the [Monitor Queries document](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-platform/query/monitor-queries.html) to learn more about this feature. |
| Query accelerated reporting insights data model | As part of the Data Distiller SKU, the query accelerated store allows you to reduce the time and processing power required to gain critical insights from your data. With the query accelerated store you can build a custom data model and/or extend on existing Adobe Real-Time Customer Data Platform data models to improve your reporting insights and their visualizations. See the [query accelerated store reporting insights document](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-platform/query/query-accelerated-store/reporting-insights-data-model.html) to learn more about this feature.  |
