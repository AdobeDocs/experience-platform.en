# Adobe Experience Platform release notes 

**Release date: July 27, 2022**

Updates to existing features in Adobe Experience Platform:

- [Experience Data Model (XDM)](#xdm)

## Experience Data Model (XDM) {#xdm}

XDM is an open-source specification that provides common structures and definitions (schemas) for data that is brought into Adobe Experience Platform. By adhering to XDM standards, all customer experience data can be incorporated into a common representation to deliver insights in a faster, more integrated way. You can gain valuable insights from customer actions, define customer audiences through segments, and use customer attributes for personalization purposes.
