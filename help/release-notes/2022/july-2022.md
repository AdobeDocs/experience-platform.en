## Real-Time Customer Data Platform B2B Edition {#b2b}

Built on Real-Time Customer Data Platform (Real-Time CDP), Real-Time CDP B2B Edition is purpose-built for marketers operating in a business-to-business service model. It brings together data from multiple sources and combines it into a single view of people and account profiles. This unified data allows marketers to precisely target specific audiences and engage those audiences across all available channels.

**New features**

| Feature | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Lead to account matching | Lead to account matching enables you to join known person profiles to account profiles. You can then segment and target data in a B2B context such as accounts or opportunities. The daily-run jobs use both deterministic and probabilistic factors to match person profiles that are not already associated to any account to a best-matched account. You can then decide whether to include such matches in your segment definitions. <br><br>For more information, see the document on [lead to account matching](../../rtcdp/b2b-ai-ml-services/lead-to-account-matching.md). For instructions on how to configure lead to account matching, see the [Account profile UI guide](../../rtcdp/account/../accounts/account-profile-ui-guide.md#configure-lead-to-account-matching).</li>|
|Predictive lead and account scoring | Predictive Lead and Account Scoring uses a tree-based (random forest/gradient boosting) machine learning method which involves learning from and predicting for the opportunity stage conversion events, and aggregating person activities onto the account level to produce the account scores. Top influential factors are also available at both the aggregate and the unit level to help B2B marketers better understand what elements drove the scores. <br><br>For more information, see the document on [predictive lead and account scoring](../../rtcdp/b2b-ai-ml-services/predictive-lead-and-account-scoring.md). For information on how to manage your scores, see the guide on [managing predictive lead and account scoring in Real-Time Customer Data Platform, B2B Edition.](../../rtcdp/b2b-ai-ml-services/manage-predictive-lead-and-account-scoring.md) |

For a guide on how to monitor profile enrichment, see the document on [monitoring profile enrichment in the UI](../../dataflows/ui/b2b/monitor-profile-enrichment.md). To learn more about Real-Time CDP B2B Edition, see the [Real-Time CDP B2B overview](../../rtcdp/overview.md).

## Real-Time Customer Profile {#profile}

Adobe Experience Platform enables you to drive coordinated, consistent, and relevant experiences for your customers no matter where or when they interact with your brand. With Real-Time Customer Profile, you can see a holistic view of each individual customer that combines data from multiple channels, including online, offline, CRM, and third party data. Profile allows you to consolidate customer data into a unified view offering an actionable, timestamped account of every customer interaction.

| Feature | Description |
| ------- | ----------- |
| Orphaned profile edge attribute cleanup (limited release) | If your organization has access to this feature, Profile Service now removes leftover edge attributes of user activity region on a daily basis to give a more accurate representation of your profiles in your system. This clean up occurs after all the profile fragments for a given profile are deleted and should impact profiles being merged from datasets where `com_adobe_aep_profile_region_dataset` is marked as true. This may show a drop in the "Addressable audience" metric in the license usage dashboard and may show a drop in the "Profile count" metric in the Profile dashboard, since these metrics included leftover edge attribute fragments prior to this release. |

{style="table-layout:auto"}

To learn more about Real-Time Customer Profile, including tutorials and best practices for working with profile data, please begin by reading the [Real-Time Customer Profile overview](../../profile/home.md).

## Sources {#sources}

Adobe Experience Platform can ingest data from external sources while allowing you to structure, label, and enhance that data using Platform services. You can ingest data from a variety of sources such as Adobe applications, cloud-based storage, third-party software, and your CRM system.

Experience Platform provides a RESTful API and an interactive UI that lets you set up source connections for various data providers with ease. These source connections allow you to authenticate and connect to external storage systems and CRM services, set times for ingestion runs, and manage data ingestion throughput.

**New features**

| Feature | Description |
