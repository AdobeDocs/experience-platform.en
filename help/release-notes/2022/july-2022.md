Updates to existing features in Adobe Experience Platform:

- [[!DNL Data Prep]](#data-prep)
- [Sources](#sources)

## [!DNL Data Prep] {#data-prep}

[!DNL Data Prep] allows data engineers to map, transform, and validate data to and from Experience Data Model (XDM).

**Updated features**

| Feature | Description | 
| --- | --- |
| Enhancements to [!DNL Data Prep] Recommendations | [!DNL Data Prep] Recommendations are now smarter and faster. New validation checks significantly reduce the most common mapping errors, further reducing the Time-to-Value. |
| Hierarchy support for streaming upsets | You can now use functions `upsert_array_append` and `upsert_array_replace` to update arrays and objects when streaming upserts to Profile. See the [[!DNL Data Prep] mapping functions guide](../../data-prep/functions.md) for more information. |

## Sources {#sources}

Adobe Experience Platform can ingest data from external sources while allowing you to structure, label, and enhance that data using Platform services. You can ingest data from a variety of sources such as Adobe applications, cloud-based storage, third-party software, and your CRM system.

Experience Platform provides a RESTful API and an interactive UI that lets you set up source connections for various data providers with ease. These source connections allow you to authenticate and connect to external storage systems and CRM services, set times for ingestion runs, and manage data ingestion throughput.
