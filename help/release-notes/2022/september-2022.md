## Attribute-based access control {#abac}

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>Attribute-based access control will be enabled starting October 2022. If you would like to be an early adopter, please contact your Adobe representative.

Attribute-based access control is a capability of Adobe Experience Platform that gives privacy conscious brands greater flexibility to manage user access. Individual objects such as schema fields and segments can be assigned to user roles. This feature lets you grant or revoke access to individual objects for specific Platform users in your organization.

Through attribute-based access control, administrators of your organization can control users' access to, sensitive personal data (SPD), personally identifiable information (PII) and other customized type of data across all Platform workflows and resources. Administrators can define user roles that have access only to specific fields and data that correspond to those fields.

| Feature | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Attribute-based access control | Attribute-based access control allows you to label Experience Data Model (XDM) schema fields and segments with labels that define organizational or data usage scopes. In parallel, administrators can use the user and role administration interface to define access policies covering XDM schema fields and segments to better manage the access given to users or groups of users (internal, external, or third-party users). For more information, see the [attribute-based access control overview](../../access-control/abac/overview.md). |
| Permissions | Permissions is the area of Experience Cloud where administrators can define user roles and access policies to manage access permissions for features and objects within a product application. Through Permissions, you can create and manage roles, assign the desired resource permissions for these roles, and build policies to leverage labels and define which user roles have access to specific Platform resources. Permissions also allow you to manage the labels, sandboxes, and users associated with a specific role. For more information, see the [Permissions UI guide](../../access-control/abac/ui/browse.md). |

For more information on attribute-based access control, see the [attribute-based access control overview](../../access-control/abac/overview.md). For a comprehensive guide on the attribute-based access control workflow, read the [attribute-based access control end-to-end guide](../../access-control/abac/end-to-end-guide.md).

## [!DNL Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning services] {#ai-and-ml-services}

AI/ML services empower marketing analysts and practitioners to leverage the power of artificial intelligence and machine learning in customer experience use cases. This allows for marketing analysts to set up models specific to a company's needs using business-level configurations without the need for data science expertise.

### Attribution AI

Attribution AI is used to attribute credits to touchpoints leading to conversion events. This can be used by marketers to help quantify the marketing impact of each individual marketing touchpoint across customer journeys.

| Feature | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Save Draft Instance | This new feature enables marketing analysts to save a model configuration as a draft instance and continue to edit it until it is complete prior to training and scoring. Scenarios where this feature is helpful include, when a user has multiple fields to define in the workflow but cannot complete it due to time constraints. Another scenario is when one or more dataset statistics are being processed and not yet available. Read the [Attribution AI user guide](../../intelligent-services/attribution-ai/user-guide.md#governance-policies) to learn more.|
| Governance policies | After users submit to create an instance through the configuration workflow, the new policy enforcement service checks whether there are any policy violations of data usage and displays the details in a popover. It ensures that data operations and marketing actions are compliant with the data usage policies configured on Adobe Experience Platform. |

For more information on Attribution AI, the [Attribution AI overview](../../intelligent-services/attribution-ai/overview.md). For information on data governance policies, read the [policies overview](../../data-governance/policies/overview.md).

### Customer AI

Customer AI available in Real-Time Customer Data Platform, is used to generate custom propensity scores such as churn and conversion for individual profiles at scale.

| Feature | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Save Draft Instance |  This new feature enables marketing analysts to save a model configuration as a draft instance and continue to edit it until it is complete prior to training and scoring. Scenarios where this feature is helpful include, when a user has multiple fields to define in the workflow but cannot complete it due to time constraints. Another scenario is when one or more dataset statistics are being processed and not yet available.

## [!DNL Dashboards] {#dashboards}

Adobe Experience Platform provides multiple dashboards through which you can view important insights about your organization's data, as captured during daily snapshots.

| Feature | Description |
| --- | --- |
| In-use label  | When viewed in the widget library, the in-use label easily identifies the presence of existing widgets in your dashboard. This makes it easy to avoid the duplication although you can still add the same widget more than once should you wish. |
| User-defined dashboards | User-defined dashboards help to expedite insights and customize visualizations by enabling you to build and manage custom dashboards. With user-defined dashboards you can create, add, and edit bespoke widgets to visualize key metrics relevant to your organization. Read the [feature guide](../../dashboards/user-defined-dashboards.md) to learn more. |
| Customer Data Platform Insights Data Model | The Customer Data Platform (CDP) Insights Data Model feature exposes the data models and SQL that powers the insights for various profile, destination, and segmentation widgets. You can customize these SQL query templates to create CDP reports for your marketing and key performance indicator use cases. These insights can then be used as custom widgets for your user-defined dashboards. Read the [CDP Insights Data Model feature guide](../../dashboards/cdp-insights-data-model.md) to learn more. |
| Audience overlap report widget | This widget is available for both for both [!UICONTROL Profiles] and [!UICONTROL Segments] dashboards. The report provides an ordered list of audiences ranked by the highest or lowest overlap percentages for your chosen segment. From the [!UICONTROL Profiles] dashboard you can filter and view your audience overlap by merge policy from all available segments. The [!UICONTROL Segments] dashboards allows you to filter the audience overlap by a specific segment.<br>Use this analysis to build new, high-performance segments and avoid sending the same audience to different destinations. The report also helps to identify hidden insights to improve segmentation or locate unique profiles to pursue. Read the respective [profiles](../../dashboards/guides/profiles.md#audience-overlap-report) and [segments](../../dashboards/guides/segments.md#audience-overlap-report) widget guides to learn more. |
