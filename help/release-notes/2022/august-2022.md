## [!DNL Dashboards] {#dashboards}

Adobe Experience Platform provides multiple [!DNL dashboards] through which you can view important insights about your organization's data, as captured during daily snapshots.

**Updated features**

| Feature | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Scheduled activations widget | The [!UICONTROL Scheduled activations] widget provides a tabularized view of the most recently activated destinations. For each segment, it includes the name, destination platform, and activation start and end date. This widget allows you to discover at a glance where and when the audience is being activated and makes duplicate or unnecessary activations more transparent. This accumulated information also highlights where any activations have been left out. | 

For more information on [!DNL Dashboards], please see the [[!DNL Dashboards] overview](../../dashboards/home.md).

## [!DNL Data Prep] {#data-prep}

[!DNL Data Prep] allows data engineers to map, transform, and validate data to and from Experience Data Model (XDM).

**Updated features**

| Feature | Description | 
| --- | --- |
| Support for ingesting records with warnings | Data Prep will now localize warnings (non-critical errors) to the fields and will allow the rest of the row to be ingested. All mapper transformation errors are now reported as warnings and rows that are partially ingested are considered successful, with a warning.  Monitoring is also supported on records with warnings and diagnostic details. Partial ingestion of records with warnings is currently only available to streaming data. Review the documentation on [ingesting records with warnings](../../sources/tutorials/ui/monitor-streaming.md) for more information. |

## Real-Time Customer Profile {#profile}

Adobe Experience Platform enables you to drive coordinated, consistent, and relevant experiences for your customers no matter where or when they interact with your brand. With Real-Time Customer Profile, you can see a holistic view of each individual customer that combines data from multiple channels, including online, offline, CRM, and third party data. Profile allows you to consolidate customer data into a unified view offering an actionable, timestamped account of every customer interaction.

| Feature | Description |
| ------- | ----------- |
| Merge policies hard limit | Platform will now enforce a hard limit of **five** merge policies per sandbox. If your sandbox currently has more than five merge policies, you will **not** be able to create new merge policies until the sandbox has less than five merge policies. |
| Orphaned profile edge attribute cleanup | For all organizations, Profile Service now removes leftover edge attributes of user activity region on a daily basis to give a more accurate representation of your profiles in your system. This cleanup occurs after all the profile fragments for a given profile are deleted and should impact profiles being merged from datasets where `com_adobe_aep_profile_region_dataset` is marked as `true`. This may show a drop in the "Addressable audience" metric in the license usage dashboard and may show a drop in the "Profile count" metric in the Profile dashboard, since these metrics included leftover edge attribute fragments prior to this release. |

{style="table-layout:auto"}

To learn more about Real-Time Customer Profile, including tutorials and best practices for working with profile data, please begin by reading the [Real-Time Customer Profile overview](../../profile/home.md).
