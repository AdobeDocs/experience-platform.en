# Adobe Experience Platform release notes 

**Release date: August 24, 2022**

Updates to existing features in Adobe Experience Platform:

- [Sources](#sources)

## Sources {#sources}

Adobe Experience Platform can ingest data from external sources while allowing you to structure, label, and enhance that data using Platform services. You can ingest data from a variety of sources such as Adobe applications, cloud-based storage, third-party software, and your CRM system.

Experience Platform provides a RESTful API and an interactive UI that lets you set up source connections for various data providers with ease. These source connections allow you to authenticate and connect to external storage systems and CRM services, set times for ingestion runs, and manage data ingestion throughput.

**New features**

| Feature | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Cross-region support for Adobe Analytics source | You can now ingest report suites from any region (United States, United Kingdom, or Singapore). Report suites must be mapped to the same organization as the Experience Platform Sandbox instance in which the source connection is being created in. For more information, see the guide on [creating an Adobe Analytics source connection in the UI](../../sources/tutorials/ui/create/adobe-applications/analytics.md). |
