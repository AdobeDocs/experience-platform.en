## Sandboxes {#sandboxes}

Adobe Experience Platform is built to enrich digital experience applications on a global scale. Companies often run multiple digital experience applications in parallel and need to cater for the development, testing, and deployment of these applications while ensuring operational compliance. In order to address this need, Experience Platform provides sandboxes which partition a single Platform instance into separate virtual environments to help develop and evolve digital experience applications.

| Feature | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Sandboxes UI enhancements | The sandbox indicator is now integrated within the header for all Platform UI applications. The sandbox indicator displays the sandbox name, region, and type and also allows you to access a dropdown menu to switch between sandboxes. For more information, see the [sandbox UI guide](../../sandboxes/ui/user-guide.md). |

For more information on sandboxes, please see the [sandboxes overview](../../sandboxes/home.md).

## Segmentation Service {#segmentation}

[!DNL Segmentation Service] defines a particular subset of profiles by describing the criteria that distinguishes a marketable group of people within your customer base. Segments can be based on record data (such as demographic information) or time series events representing customer interactions with your brand.

| Feature | Description |
