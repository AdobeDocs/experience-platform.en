For more information on audit logs in Platform, refer to the [audit logs overview](../../landing/governance-privacy-security/audit-logs/overview.md).

## Data hygiene {#hygiene}

Experience Platform provides a suite of data hygiene capabilities that allow you manage your stored data through programmatic deletions of consumer records and datasets. Using either the [!UICONTROL Data Hygiene] workspace in the UI or through calls to the Data Hygiene API, you can manage your data stores to ensure that information is used as expected, is updated when incorrect data needs fixing, and is deleted when organizational policies deem it necessary.

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>Data hygiene capabilities are currently only available for organizations that have purchased the Adobe Shield for Healthcare add-on offering.

**New features**

| Feature | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Consumer deletion | [Delete consumer records](../../hygiene/ui/delete-consumer.md) from the data lake and Profile store based on primary identity data. |
| Time to live (TTL) for datasets | [Schedule TTLs](../../hygiene/ui/ttl.md) for Platform datasets.  |

For more information on audit logs in Platform, refer to the [data hygiene overview](../../hygiene/home.md).


## Data collection {#data-collection}

Experience Platform provides a suite of technologies that allow you to collect client-side customer experience data and send it to the Adobe Experience Platform Edge Network where it can be enriched, transformed, and distributed to Adobe or non-Adobe destinations.

**New features**

| Feature | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Copy datastreams | [Create a copy of an existing datastream](../../edge/datastreams/overview.md#copy) and adjust its configuration as necessary, avoiding the need to start from scratch. |
| Import datastream mapping rules | When setting up Data Prep for Data Collection, you can [import the mapping rules of an existing datastream](../../edge/datastreams/data-prep.md#import-mapping) instead of configuring every field mapping manually. |
| Datasteam mapping support for Mobile SDK | You can now configure Data Prep for Data Collection on datastreams intended for use with the Experience Platform Mobile SDK. |
| Datasteam mapping support for XDM objects | Map XDM objects in addition to data-layer objects when [configuring Data Prep for Data Collection](../../edge/datastreams/data-prep.md#select-data). |

For more information on data collection in Platform, please see the [data collection overview](../../collection/home.md).

## Data Governance {#governance}

Adobe Experience Platform Data Governance is a series of strategies and technologies used to manage customer data and ensure compliance with regulations, restrictions, and policies applicable to data usage. It plays a key role within [!DNL Experience Platform] at various levels, including cataloging, data lineage, data usage labeling, data access policies, and access control on data for marketing actions.

**New features**

| Feature | Description | 
| ------- | ----------- |
| Consent policy enforcement (limited availability) | If your organization has purchased the Adobe Shield for Healthcare add-on offering, you can now [create consent policies](../../data-governance/policies/user-guide.md#consent-policy) to automatically [enforce customer consents and preferences in segment participation](../../data-governance/enforcement/auto-enforcement.md#consent-policy-evaluation). |

See the [Data Governance overview](../../data-governance/home.md) for more information on the service.

## Experience Data Model (XDM) {#xdm}

XDM is an open-source specification that provides common structures and definitions (schemas) for data that is brought into Adobe Experience Platform. By adhering to XDM standards, all customer experience data can be incorporated into a common representation to deliver insights in a faster, more integrated way. You can gain valuable insights from customer actions, define customer audiences through segments, and use customer attributes for personalization purposes.

**New XDM components**

| Component type | Name | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Field group | [[!UICONTROL Change set]](https://github.com/adobe/xdm/blob/master/components/fieldgroups/shared/changeset.schema.json) | Captures row-level changes to and from datasets. This field group can be employed by any class. |
| Field group | [[!UICONTROL Reference keys]](https://github.com/adobe/xdm/blob/master/components/fieldgroups/experience-event/experienceevent-reference-keys.schema.json) | Captures reference keys for ExperienceEvent schemas, allowing you to build relationships with schemas based on other classes. |
