## Attribute-based access control {#abac}

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>Attribute-based access control is currently available in a limited release. This capability will be available to all Real-time Customer Data Platform customers once it is fully released.

Attribute-based access control is a capability of Adobe Experience Platform that enables administrators to control access to specific objects and/or capabilities based on attributes. Attributes can be an existing value such as the geolocation or department of a person. Attributes can also be metadata that is added to an object such as a label added to a schema field or segment. An administrator defines access policies that include attributes to manage user access permissions.

Through attribute-based access control, administrators of your organization can control users' access to both sensitive personal data (SPD) and personally identifiable information (PII) across all Platform workflows and resources. Administrators can define specific user roles that have access only to specific fields, as well as only to specific data that correspond to those fields.

| Feature | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Attribute-based access control | Attribute-based access control allows you to label Experience Data Model (XDM) schema fields with labels that define organizational or data usage scopes. In parallel, administrators can use the user and role administration interface to define access policies surrounding XDM schema fields and better manage the access given to users or groups of users (internal, external, or third-party users). Additionally, attribute-based access control allows administrators to manage access to specific segments. |
| Permissions | Permissions is the area of Experience Cloud where administrators can define user roles and access polices to manage access permissions for features, capabilities, and objects within a product application. Once your organization is enabled for attribute-based access control, you can start using Permissions on Adobe Experience Cloud, instead of Product Profiles in the Adobe Admin Console, to manage permissions for users, functionality, labels, and other resources in your organization. For more information, see the [Permissions UI guide](../../access-control/abac/overview.md). |

<!--Update link above to Permissions, once Permissions is merged in. -->

For more information on attribute-based access control, see the [attribute-based access control overview](../../access-control/abac/overview.md).

<!-- ## Data hygiene {#hygiene}

Experience Platform provides a suite of data hygiene capabilities that allow you manage your stored data through programmatic deletions of consumer records and datasets. Using either the [!UICONTROL Data Hygiene] workspace in the UI or through calls to the Data Hygiene API, you can manage your data stores to ensure that information is used as expected, is updated when incorrect data needs fixing, and is deleted when organizational policies deem it necessary.

**New features**

| Feature | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Consumer deletion | [Delete consumer records](../../hygiene/ui/delete-consumer.md) from the data lake and Profile store based on primary identity data. |
| Time to live (TTL) for datasets | [Schedule TTLs](../../hygiene/ui/ttl.md) for Platform datasets.  |

For more information on audit logs in Platform, refer to the [data hygiene overview](../../hygiene/home.md). -->


<!-- ## Data collection {#data-collection}

Platform provides a suite of technologies that allow you to collect client-side customer experience data and send it to the Adobe Experience Platform Edge Network where it can be enriched, transformed, and distributed to Adobe or non-Adobe destinations.

**New features**

| Feature | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Copy datastreams | [Create a copy of an existing datastream](../../edge/datastreams/overview.md#copy-a-datastream) and adjust its configuration as necessary, avoiding the need to start from scratch. |
| Import datastream mapping rules | When setting up Data Prep for Data Collection, you can [import the mapping rules of an existing datastream](../../edge/datastreams/data-prep.md#import-mapping) instead of configuring every field mapping manually. |
| Datasteam mapping support for Mobile SDK | You can now configure Data Prep for Data Collection on datastreams intended for use with the Experience Platform Mobile SDK. |
| Datasteam mapping support for XDM objects | Map XDM objects in addition to data-layer objects when [configuring Data Prep for Data Collection](../../edge/datastreams/data-prep.md#select-data). |

For more information on data collection in Platform, please see the [data collection overview](../../collection/home.md). -->

## [!DNL Data Prep] {#data-prep}

[!DNL Data Prep] allows data engineers to map, transform, and validate data to and from Experience Data Model (XDM).

**Updated features**

| Feature | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Attribute-based access control in [!DNL Data Prep] | You will now only be able to map attributes that you have access to. Attributes that you do not have access to can not be used in pass-through mappings and calculated fields. For more information, see [attribute-based access control in [!DNL Data Prep]](../../data-prep/home.md). **Note**: Attribute-based access control is currently available in a limited release. This capability will be available to all Real-time Customer Data Platform customers once it is fully released. |
| Localized data errors | [!DNL Data Prep] now localizes all transformation errors to the attribute level (previously at the row level). Dataflows will now ingest partial rows filled with columns that do not have any transformation errors, instead of ignoring the full rows. |
| Stream upserts to [!DNL Profile Service] | Stream upserts with [!DNL Data Prep] to send partial row updates to Profile Service using the [[!DNL Amazon Kinesis]](../../sources/connectors/cloud-storage/kinesis.md), [[!DNL Azure Event Hubs]](../../sources/connectors/cloud-storage/eventhub.md), or [[!DNL HTTP API]](../../sources/connectors/streaming/http.md) source. See the guide on [streaming upserts](../../data-prep/upserts.md) for more information. |

For more information on [!DNL Data Prep], please see the [[!DNL Data Prep] overview](../../data-prep/home.md).

## Experience Data Model (XDM) {#xdm}

XDM is an open-source specification that provides common structures and definitions (schemas) for data that is brought into Adobe Experience Platform. By adhering to XDM standards, all customer experience data can be incorporated into a common representation to deliver insights in a faster, more integrated way. You can gain valuable insights from customer actions, define customer audiences through segments, and use customer attributes for personalization purposes.

**New XDM components**

| Component type | Name | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Field group | [[!UICONTROL Change set]](https://github.com/adobe/xdm/blob/master/components/fieldgroups/shared/changeset.schema.json) | Captures row-level changes to and from datasets. This field group can be employed by any class. |
| Field group | [[!UICONTROL Reference keys]](https://github.com/adobe/xdm/blob/master/components/fieldgroups/experience-event/experienceevent-reference-keys.schema.json) | Captures reference keys for ExperienceEvent schemas, allowing you to build relationships with schemas based on other classes. |
