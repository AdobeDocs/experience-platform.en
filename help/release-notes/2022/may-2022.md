# Adobe Experience Platform release notes 

**Release date: May 25, 2022**

<!-- New features in Adobe Experience Platform:

- [Data hygiene](#hygiene) -->

Updates to existing features in Adobe Experience Platform:

<!-- - [Data collection](#data-collection) -->


<!-- ## Data hygiene {#hygiene}

Experience Platform provides a suite of data hygiene capabilities that allow you manage your stored data through programmatic deletions of consumer records and datasets. Using either the [!UICONTROL Data Hygiene] workspace in the UI or through calls to the Data Hygiene API, you can manage your data stores to ensure that information is used as expected, is updated when incorrect data needs fixing, and is deleted when organizational policies deem it necessary.

**New features**

| Feature | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Consumer deletion | [Delete consumer records](../../hygiene/ui/delete-consumer.md) from the data lake and Profile store based on primary identity data. |
| Time to live (TTL) for datasets | [Schedule TTLs](../../hygiene/ui/ttl.md) for Platform datasets.  |

<!-- ## Data collection {#data-collection}

Platform provides a suite of technologies that allow you to collect client-side customer experience data and send it to the Adobe Experience Platform Edge Network where it can be enriched, transformed, and distributed to Adobe or non-Adobe destinations.

**New features**

| Feature | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Copy datastreams | [Create a copy of an existing datastream](../../edge/datastreams/overview.md#copy-a-datastream) and adjust its configuration as necessary, avoiding the need to start from scratch. |
| Import datastream mapping rules | When setting up Data Prep for Data Collection, you can [import the mapping rules of an existing datastream](../../edge/datastreams/data-prep.md#import-mapping) instead of configuring every field mapping manually. |
| Datasteam mapping support for Mobile SDK | You can now configure Data Prep for Data Collection on datastreams intended for use with the Experience Platform Mobile SDK. |
| Datasteam mapping support for XDM objects | Map XDM objects in addition to data-layer objects when [configuring Data Prep for Data Collection](../../edge/datastreams/data-prep.md#select-data). |

For more information on data collection in Platform, please see the [data collection overview](../../collection/home.md). -->
