## Attribute-based access control {#abac}

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>Attribute-based access control is currently available in a limited release for US-based healthcare customers. This capability will be available to all Real-time Customer Data Platform customers once it is fully released.

Attribute-based access control is a capability of Adobe Experience Platform that enables administrators to control access to specific objects and/or capabilities based on attributes. Attributes can be metadata added to an object, such as a label added to a schema field or segment. An administrator defines access policies that include attributes to manage user access permissions.

Through attribute-based access control, administrators of your organization can control users’ access to both sensitive personal data (SPD) and personally identifiable information (PII) across all Platform workflows and resources. Administrators can define user roles that have access only to specific fields and data that correspond to those fields.

| Feature | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Attribute-based access control | Attribute-based access control allows you to label Experience Data Model (XDM) schema fields with labels that define organizational or data usage scopes. In parallel, administrators can use the user and role administration interface to define access policies covering XDM schema fields and better manage the access given to users or groups of users (internal, external, or third-party users). Additionally, attribute-based access control allows administrators to manage access to specific segments. For more information, see the [attribute-based access control overview](../../access-control/abac/overview.md). |
| Permissions | Permissions is the area of Experience Cloud where administrators can define user roles and access policies to manage access permissions for features and objects within a product application. Through Permissions, you can create and manage roles, as well as assign the desired resource permissions for these roles. Permissions also allow you to manage the labels, sandboxes, and users associated with a specific role. For more information, see the [Permissions UI guide](../../access-control/abac/ui/browse.md). |

For more information on attribute-based access control, see the [attribute-based access control overview](../../access-control/abac/overview.md).

## Data hygiene {#hygiene}

Experience Platform provides a suite of data hygiene capabilities that allow you manage your stored data through programmatic deletions of consumer records and datasets. Using either the [!UICONTROL Data Hygiene] workspace in the UI or through calls to the Data Hygiene API, you can manage your data stores to ensure that information is used as expected, is updated when incorrect data needs fixing, and is deleted when organizational policies deem it necessary.

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>Data hygiene capabilities are currently only available for organizations that have purchased the Healthcare Shield add-on offering.

**New features**

| Feature | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Dataset expirations | [Schedule TTLs](../../hygiene/ui/dataset-expiration.md) for Platform datasets.  |

When not using a datastream, segments exported from Experience Platform to Target will only support next-session personalization, while edge segmentation is disabled, along with all [use cases](../../destinations/ui/configure-personalization-destinations.md) that depend on edge segmentation. |

{style="table-layout:auto"}

## Experience Data Model (XDM) {#xdm}

XDM is an open-source specification that provides common structures and definitions (schemas) for data that is brought into Adobe Experience Platform. By adhering to XDM standards, all customer experience data can be incorporated into a common representation to deliver insights in a faster, more integrated way. You can gain valuable insights from customer actions, define customer audiences through segments, and use customer attributes for personalization purposes.

## Query Service {#query-service}

Query Service allows you to use standard SQL to query data in Adobe Experience Platform [!DNL data lake]. You can join any datasets from the [!DNL data lake] and capture the query results as a new dataset for use in reporting, Data Science Workspace, or for ingestion into Real-time Customer Profile.

**Updated features**
