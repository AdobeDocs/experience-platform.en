## [!DNL Experience Data Model] (XDM) System {#xdm}

Standardization and interoperability are key concepts behind [!DNL Experience Platform]. [!DNL Experience Data Model] (XDM), driven by Adobe, is an effort to standardize customer experience data and define schemas for customer experience management.

XDM is a publicly documented specification designed to improve the power of digital experiences. It provides common structures and definitions for any application to communicate with services on Adobe Experience Platform. By adhering to XDM standards, all customer experience data can be incorporated into a common representation delivering insights in a faster, more integrated way. You can gain valuable insights from customer actions, define customer audiences through segments, and use customer attributes for personalization purposes.

## Data Governance {#governance}

Adobe Experience Platform Data Governance is a series of strategies and technologies used to manage customer data and ensure compliance with regulations, restrictions, and policies applicable to data usage. It plays a key role within [!DNL Experience Platform] at various levels, including cataloging, data lineage, data usage labeling, data access policies, and access control on data for marketing actions.

Getting started with data governance requires a thorough understanding of the regulations, contractual obligations, and corporate policies that apply to your customer data. From there, data can be classified by applying the appropriate data usage labels, and its use can be controlled through the definition of data usage policies.

The Data Governance framework simplifies and streamlines the process of categorizing data and creating data usage policies through the [!DNL Experience Platform] user interface and [!DNL Policy Service] API. 

**New features**

| Feature    | Description  |
| -----------| ---------- |
| Manage data usage policies in the UI  | Data usage policies can now be managed within the **Policies** workspace in the [!DNL Experience Platform] UI. See the [policy user guide](../../data-governance/policies/user-guide.md) for more information.|

**Known issues**

* None.

For more information, please see the [Data Governance overview](../../data-governance/home.md).


## Destinations {#destinations}

**New destinations**

New legal and organizational regulations are giving users the right to access or delete their personal data from your data stores upon request. Adobe Experience Platform [!DNL Privacy Service] provides a RESTful API and user interface to help you manage these data requests from your customers. With [!DNL Privacy Service], you can submit requests to access and delete private or personal customer data from Adobe Experience Cloud applications, facilitating automated compliance with legal and organizational privacy regulations.
