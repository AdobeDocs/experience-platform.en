## Sources {#sources}

Adobe Experience Platform can ingest data from external sources while allowing you to structure, label, and enhance that data using [!DNL Platform] services. You can ingest data from a variety of sources such as Adobe applications, cloud-based storage, third party software, and your CRM system.

[!DNL Experience Platform] provides a RESTful API and an interactive UI that lets you set up source connections for various data providers with ease. These source connections allow you to authenticate and connect to external storage systems and CRM services, set times for ingestion runs, and manage data ingestion throughput.
