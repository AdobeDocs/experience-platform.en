- [[!DNL Destinations]](#destinations)
- [Experience Platform Web SDK and Experience Platform Edge Network](#edge)
- [[!DNL Real-Time Customer Profile]](#profile)
- [[!DNL Sources]](#sources)

## User interface updates {#ux}

Adobe Experience Platform is releasing updates to the domain and header bar to improve your experience and unify with other [!DNL Experience Cloud] applications.

- Easier switching between your organizations or to a different application
- Improved user help, including featured articles and context-relevant documentation in the Help menu
- Ability to give feedback about the [!DNL Experience Platform] and file support tickets  

The roll-out of the new experience is gradual. You can view the experience at [https://experience.adobe.com/platform](https://experience.adobe.com/platform).

## [!DNL Data Science Workspace] {#dsw}

[!DNL Data Science Workspace] uses machine learning and artificial intelligence to unleash insights from your data. Integrated into Adobe Experience Platform, [!DNL Data Science Workspace] helps you make predictions using your content and data assets across Adobe solutions. One of the ways [!DNL Data Science Workspace] accomplishes this is through the use of [!DNL JupyterLab]. [!DNL JupyterLab] is a web-based user interface for [[!DNL Project Jupyter]](https://jupyter.org/) and is tightly integrated into Adobe Experience Platform. It provides an interactive development environment for data scientists to work with [!DNL Jupyter] notebooks, code, and data.

**New features**

|Feature | Description|
|--- | ---|
| [!DNL JupyterLab Launcher] | The [!DNL JupyterLab Launcher] now includes starters for [!DNL Spark] 2.4 notebooks. [!DNL Spark] 2.3 notebook starters are now marked as deprecated and set to be removed in a subsequent release. |
| [!DNL Spark] 2.4 | New Scala ([!DNL Spark]) and PySpark recipes now use [!DNL Spark] 2.4. |
| Kernels | Scala ([!DNL Spark]) notebooks are now authored via the Scala kernel. PySpark notebooks are now authored via the [!DNL Python] Kernel. The [!DNL Spark] and PySpark kernel are deprecated and set to be removed in a subsequent release. |
| Recipes | New PySpark and [!DNL Spark] recipes now follow the [!DNL Docker] workflow similar to [!DNL Python] and R recipes.|

For more information on migrating your notebooks and recipes to use [!DNL Spark] 2.4, please see the [notebook data access guide](../../data-science-workspace/jupyterlab/access-notebook-data.md). For more general information on Data Science Workspace, see the [overview documentation](../../data-science-workspace/home.md).

## [!DNL Destinations] {#destinations}

In [Real-Time Customer Data Platform](../../rtcdp/overview.md), destinations are pre-built integrations with destination platforms that activate data to those partners in a seamless way.

**[!DNL Facebook]**

Real-Time CDP now supports data activation to [!DNL Facebook], allowing you to activate profiles for your [!DNL Facebook] campaigns for audience targeting, personalization and suppression based on hashed emails.

For more information about the new functionality, see the [Facebook destination](../../destinations/catalog/social/facebook.md) page.

**[!DNL Amazon Kinesis] and [!DNL Azure Event Hubs] streaming cloud storage destinations**

Real-Time CDP now supports data activation to streaming cloud storage destinations, allowing you to export audience data and events to these destinations in JSON format. You can then describe business logic on top of these events in your destinations. See below for details:

>[!NOTE]

Adobe Experience Platform can ingest data from external sources while allowing you to structure, label, and enhance that data using [!DNL Platform] services. You can ingest data from a variety of sources such as Adobe applications, cloud-based storage, third party software, and your CRM system.

[!DNL Experience Platform] provides a RESTful API and an interactive UI that lets you set up source connections for various data providers with ease. These source connections allow you to authenticate and connect to external storage systems and CRM services, set times for ingestion runs, and manage data ingestion throughput.
