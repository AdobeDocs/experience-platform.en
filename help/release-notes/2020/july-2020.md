# Adobe Experience Platform release notes 

**Release date: July 15, 2020**

Updates to existing features in Adobe Experience Platform:

- [Data Governance](#governance)
- [[!DNL Real-Time Customer Profile]](#profile)
- [[!DNL Segmentation Service]](#segmentation)
- [[!DNL Sources]](#sources)

## Data Governance {#governance}

Adobe Experience Platform Data Governance is a series of strategies and technologies used to manage customer data and ensure compliance with regulations, restrictions, and policies applicable to data usage. It plays a key role within [!DNL Experience Platform] at various levels, including cataloging, data lineage, data usage labeling, data access policies, and access control on data for marketing actions.

**New features**

| Feature    | Description  |
| -----------| ---------- |
| Automatic policy enforcement in [!DNL Real-Time Customer Data Platform] | Data usage policies are now automatically enforced in [!DNL Real-Time CDP] when violating actions occur, including activating segments to destinations. When a policy violation is triggered, users get real-time visibility into usage restrictions within the activation workflow, indicating what data they cannot use and why. |
| Adobe Audience Manager integration | Any segments that are shared with [!DNL Audience Manager] from [!DNL Experience Platform] inherit any applied data usage labels as [!DNL Data Export Controls], and vice versa. See the [!DNL Audience Manager] documentation for specific [mappings between usage labels and Data Export Controls](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/audience-manager/user-guide/implementation-integration-guides/integration-experience-platform/aam-aep-audience-sharing.html). |
| Custom data usage labels | You can now create custom data usage labels using the Policy Service API or in the UI. See the [labels overview](../../data-governance/labels/overview.md) for more information. |

See the [Data Governance overview](../../data-governance/home.md) for more information on the service.

## [!DNL Real-Time Customer Profile] {#profile}

Adobe Experience Platform enables you to drive coordinated, consistent, and relevant experiences for your customers no matter where or when they interact with your brand. With [!DNL Real-Time Customer Profile], you can see a holistic view of each individual customer that combines data from multiple channels, including online, offline, CRM, and third party data. [!DNL Profile] allows you to consolidate your disparate customer data into a unified view offering an actionable, timestamped account of every customer interaction.

**New features**

| Feature | Description |
| ------- | ----------- |
| Data usage policy enforcement | In [!DNL Real-Time Customer Data Platform], data usage policy violations are automatically surfaced when a violating action in the [!UICONTROL Profile] workspace is attempted. See the [release notes for Data Governance](#governance) for more information on automatic policy enforcement. | 

## [!DNL Segmentation Service] {#segmentation}

Adobe Experience Platform Segmentation Service provides a user interface and RESTful API that allows you to build segments and generate audiences from your [!DNL Real-Time Customer Profile] data. These segments are centrally configured and maintained on [!DNL Experience Platform], making them readily accessible by any Adobe application.

[!DNL Segmentation Service] defines a particular subset of profiles by describing the criteria that distinguishes a marketable group of people within your customer base. Segments can be based on record data (such as demographic information) or time series events representing customer interactions with your brand.

**New features**

| Feature | Description |
| ------- | ----------- |
| Streaming segmentation | Streaming segmentation can now qualify as a user into a segment as data lands into [!DNL Experience Platform], thereby dramatically reducing the segment qualification time. Streaming segmentation also alleviates the need to run segmentation jobs manually. |
| Data usage policy enforcement | In [!DNL Real-Time Customer Data Platform], data usage policy violations are automatically surfaced when a violating action in the [!UICONTROL Segments] workspace is attempted. See the [release notes for Data Governance](#governance) for more information on automatic policy enforcement. |

For more information on [!DNL Segmentation Service], please see the [Segmentation overview](../../segmentation/home.md)

## Sources {#sources}

Adobe Experience Platform can ingest data from external sources while allowing you to structure, label, and enhance that data using [!DNL Experience Platform] services. You can ingest data from a variety of sources such as Adobe applications, cloud-based storage, third party software, and your CRM system.

[!DNL Experience Platform] provides a RESTful API and an interactive UI that lets you set up source connections for various data providers with ease. These source connections allow you to authenticate and connect to external storage systems and CRM services, set times for ingestion runs, and manage data ingestion throughput.

**New features**

| Feature | Description |
| ------- | ----------- |
| UI support for deleting dataflows | Dataflows that were made with errors or have become unnecessary can now be deleted through the UI. |
| API and UI support for one-time ingestion | One-time ingestion for dataflows, where only the start date is provided and no future ingestion is scheduled, can now be executed through APIs or using the UI. |

To learn more about sources, see the [sources overview](../../sources/home.md).
