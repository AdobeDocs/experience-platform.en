## Destinations {#destinations}

[!DNL Destinations] are pre-built integrations with destination platforms that allow for the seamless activation of data from Adobe Experience Platform. You can use destinations to activate your known and unknown data for cross-channel marketing campaigns, email campaigns, targeted advertising, and many other use cases.

**Updated destinations**

| Destination | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Limited availability of the [Google Customer Match + Display & Video 360](/help/destinations/catalog/advertising/google-customer-match-dv360.md) connection | After being briefly available to all customers in June, Adobe has returned this integration to limited availability. Currently, access to this destination is restricted to customers who are already enabled, while Adobe and Google work to resolve implementation issues. If you're interested in using this integration once the broader rollout resumes, please contact your Adobe representative to express your intent. |

**New or updated functionality**

| Feature | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Account names and descriptions for destination connections | You can now [add account names and descriptions](/help/destinations/ui/connect-destination.md) when connecting to destinations, enabling better management of destinations with multiple accounts. |
| Enhanced datastream information for edge destinations | The right-rail information for [Adobe Target](/help/destinations/catalog/personalization/adobe-target-v2.md) and [Custom Personalization](/help/destinations/catalog/personalization/custom-personalization.md) destinations has been improved to display the datastream name, offering clearer visibility into associated datastream configurations and helping reduce confusion when reviewing existing dataflows. The **[!UICONTROL Datastream ID]** selector in the destination configuration screen has been updated to **[!UICONTROL Datastream]** for improved clarity in the user interface. |
| Marketing actions visibility in destination selection | Marketing actions are now displayed in the right rail of the **[[!UICONTROL Browse]](/help/destinations/ui/destinations-workspace.md#browse)**  tab in the Destinations workspace and on the **[[!UICONTROL Dataflow runs]](/help/dataflows/ui/monitor-destinations.md)** page, providing immediate visibility into marketing action changes without needing to navigate to the view page. This enhancement improves the user experience by making it easier to verify marketing action configurations during destination setup. |
|[!BADGE Limited beta]{type=Informative} Edit marketing actions for destinations | You can now edit marketing actions for existing destinations. This feature is currently in limited beta. To request access, contact your Adobe representative. |
|[!BADGE Limited beta]{type=Informative} Edit destinations | You can now edit your destination configuration after it has been created. This feature is currently in limited beta. To request access, contact your Adobe representative. |

**Fixes**

## Data Ingestion {#ingestion}

Experience Platform provides a comprehensive data ingestion framework that supports both batch and streaming data ingestion from various sources.

**New features**

| Feature | Description |
| ------- | ----------- |
| Support for monitoring streaming profile ingestion | Real-time monitoring for streaming profile ingestion is now available, providing transparency into throughput, latency, and data quality metrics. This supports proactive alerting and actionable insights to help data engineers identify capacity violations and ingestion issues. Read the guide on [monitoring streaming profile ingestion](../../dataflows/ui/monitor-streaming-profile.md) for more information. |

For more information, read the [data ingestion overview](../../ingestion/home.md).

## Query Service {#query-service}

Query data in the Adobe Experience Platform data lake using standard SQL with Query Service. Seamlessly combine datasets and generate new ones from your query results to power reporting, enable data science workflows, or facilitate ingestion into Real-Time Customer Profile. For example, you can merge customer transaction data with behavioral data to identify high-value audiences for targeted marketing campaigns.

**New or updated features**

| Feature | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Support for non-expiring credentials password character restrictions | Data Distiller now supports [non-expiring credentials with specific character restrictions](../../query-service/ui/credentials.md#non-expiring-credentials). While passwords require at least one number, one lowercase letter, one uppercase letter, and one special character, the dollar sign ($) is not supported. Recommended special characters include `!, @, #, ^, or &`. |
| Improved performance consistency across environments | Data Distiller [performance is now consistent between development and production sandboxes](../../query-service/troubleshooting-guide.md#data-distiller), with similar backend resources available in both environments. Compute hours consumed may vary based on data volume and available backend compute resources at the time of processing. |

For more information on [!DNL Query Service], please see the [[!DNL Query Service] overview](../../query-service/home.md).

## Real-Time CDP B2B Edition {#b2b}

Real-Time CDP B2B Edition provides comprehensive B2B customer data management capabilities, enabling organizations to build unified customer profiles, create sophisticated B2B audiences, and activate data across various marketing channels.

**New or updated features**

| Feature | Description |
| ------- | ----------- |
| B2B architecture upgrade | Experience Platform is upgrading to a new B2B architecture that introduces significant improvements to multi-entity audiences with B2B attributes. This upgrade consolidates merge policy support, enhances audience counts accuracy, and improves entity resolution capabilities. Read the [Real-Time CDP B2B Edition architecture upgrade overview](../../rtcdp/b2b-architecture-upgrade.md) for a comprehensive breakdown of the changes. |
| Merge policy consolidation for multi-entity audiences | Multi-entity audiences with B2B attributes now support only a single merge policy — the default merge policy — instead of supporting multiple merge policies. This change ensures consistent audience composition and simplifies merge logic management. For more information, read the [merge policies overview](../../profile/merge-policies/overview.md). |
| Enhanced audience counts for B2B entities | Audience size estimates for audiences with B2B entities like Accounts and Opportunities are now exact, based on real-time segmentation results. This improvement provides more accurate and reliable estimates for audiences involving complex B2B relationships. |
| Account snapshots for audience membership | Audience membership details are now included for Account entities in snapshot exports, enabling access to account-level audience status, timestamps, and membership indicators. This brings feature parity between Profile (Person) and Account segmentation models. |
| Sandbox tooling changes for multi-entity audiences | Importing multi-entity audiences with B2B entities and Experience Events exported before migration is no longer supported. These audiences will fail import validation and cannot be automatically converted to the new architecture. Audiences must be re-exported after migration before importing into target sandboxes. For more information, read the [guide on objects supported for sandbox tooling](../../sandboxes/ui/sandbox-tooling.md#objects-supported-for-sandbox-tooling). |
| B2B entity API deprecations | [!DNL Profile Access] API lookup operations for B2B entities (Account-Person Relation, Opportunity Person-Relation, Campaign, Campaign Member, Marketing List, and Marketing List Members) is now deprecated. Additionally, [!DNL Profile Access] API delete operations for B2B entities (Account, Account-Person Relation, Opportunity, Opportunity Person-Relation, Campaign, Campaign Member, Marketing List, and Marketing List Members) is also deprecated. For more information, read the [entities endpoint API guide](../../profile/api/entities.md). |
| Updates to identity namespace for entity resolution  | Account and Opportunity entities now use time-precedence based merging with specific identity namespaces (`b2b_account` for Account, `b2b_opportunity` for Opportunity). All other entities are unified with primary identity overlaps merged using time-precedence based merging. For more information on entity resolution, read the [entities endpoint API guide](../../profile/api/entities.md). |

For more information, read the [Real-Time CDP B2B Edition overview](../../rtcdp/b2b-overview.md).

## Sandboxes {#sandboxes}

Experience Platform is built to enrich digital experience applications on a global scale. Companies often run multiple digital experience applications in parallel and need to cater for the development, testing, and deployment of these applications while ensuring operational compliance.

**New or updated features**

| Feature | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Changes to multi-entity audience imports | Sandbox tooling has been updated to support the new B2B architecture upgrade. Multi-entity audiences containing B2B entities and Experience Events must be re-exported after the architecture upgrade before being imported into target sandboxes via sandbox tooling. Importing pre-upgrade versions will fail validation. For more information, read the [guide on objects supported for sandbox tooling](../../sandboxes/ui/sandbox-tooling.md#objects-supported-for-sandbox-tooling). |

For more information on sandboxes, read the [sandboxes overview](../../sandboxes/home.md).

## Segmentation Service {#segmentation-service}

[!DNL Segmentation Service] defines a particular subset of profiles by describing the criteria that distinguishes a marketable group of people within your customer base. Audiences can be based on record data (such as demographic information) or time series events representing customer interactions with your brand.

**New or updated features**

| Feature | Description |
| ------- | ----------- |
| External audience API | You can use the external audiences API to programmatically import externally generated audiences into Adobe Experience Platform. For more information, please read the [external audiences endpoint guide](../../segmentation/api/external-audiences.md). |

For more information on segmentation, read the [Segmentation Service overview](../../segmentation/home.md)

## Sources {#sources}

Experience Platform provides a RESTful API and an interactive UI that lets you set up source connections for various data providers with ease. These source connections allow you to authenticate and connect to external storage systems and CRM services, set times for ingestion runs, and manage data ingestion throughput.

**New sources**

| Source | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Support for [!DNL Didomi] (Streaming SDK) | Use the [!DNL Didomi] source to ingest consent and preference management data from [!DNL Didomi], supporting compliance with privacy regulations and consent-based marketing strategies. Read the [[!DNL Didomi] source overview](../../sources/connectors/consent-and-preferences/didomi.md) for information on how to get setup. For steps on creating a source connection, read the [[!DNL Didomi] source connection guide](../../sources/tutorials/ui/create/consent-and-preferences/didomi.md).|

**New or updated functionality**

| Feature | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Support for change data capture in select sources using the [!DNL Flow Service] API | You can now create dataflows that enable change data capture for incremental ingestion using source connectors. This capability allows customers to bring change data type for incremental ingestion, improving data freshness and reducing processing overhead. For more information, read the documentation on [using change data capture for sources](../../sources/tutorials/api/change-data-capture.md) |

For more information, read the [sources overview](../../sources/home.md).

<!-- | Support for soft deletion of records in [!DNL Salesforce] | The [!DNL Salesforce] source now supports including soft deleted records through an optional `includeDeletedObjects` parameter. When set to true, customers can include soft deleted records in their [!DNL Salesforce] queries and bring these records into Experience Platform. Read the [[!DNL Salesforce] source documentation](../../sources/connectors/crm/salesforce.md) for more information. | -->
