## Access control {#access-control}

Experience Platform leverages [Adobe Admin Console](https://adminconsole.adobe.com) product profiles to link users with permissions and sandboxes. Permissions control access to a variety of Experience Platform capabilities, including data modeling, profile management, and sandbox administration.

**Key features**

| Feature | Description |
| ------- | ----------- |
| Export Dashboard Data permission | The **[!UICONTROL Download CSV]** and **[!UICONTROL Send as email]** options in dashboards now require the **[!UICONTROL Export Dashboard Data]** permission. This permission ensures that only authorized users can export tabulated insight data, supporting tighter governance and data access control policies. Read the [permissions section of the access control guide](../../access-control/home.md#permissions) for more information. |

For more information, please see the [access control overview](../../access-control/home.md). 

## Advanced data lifecycle management {#advanced-data-lifecycle-management}

Experience Platform provides a suite of data hygiene capabilities that allow you to manage your stored data through programmatic deletions of consumer records and datasets. Using either the Data Lifecycle workspace in the UI or through calls to the Data Hygiene API, you can effectively manage your data stores. Use these capabilities to ensure that information is used as expected, is updated when incorrect data needs fixing, and is deleted when organizational policies deem it necessary.

**New documentation**

| New documentation | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Record Delete General Availability | You can now delete individual records based on identity fields using the UI or API. This feature helps reduce storage, enforce governance, and improve data hygiene by allowing deletions from a single dataset or across all datasets. Volume limits and entitlement requirements apply. Read the [delete records guide](../../hygiene/ui/record-delete.md) for more information. |

For more information, read the [advanced data lifecycle management overview](../../hygiene/home.md).

## Catalog Service {#catalog-service}

Catalog Service is the system of record for data location and lineage within Adobe Experience Platform. While all data that is ingested into Experience Platform is stored in the data lake as files and directories, Catalog holds the metadata and description of those files and directories for lookup and monitoring purposes.

**New or updated features**

| Feature | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Improved dataset preview: faster navigation and clearer insights |  Quickly preview dataset data, view underlying SQL queries, and explore up to 100 rows with improved filtering and clearer structure visibility, all within the familiar Dataset Preview experience. Read the [datasets user guide](../../catalog/datasets/user-guide.md#preview) for more information. |

## Dashboards {#dashboards}

Experience Platform provides multiple dashboards through which you can view important insights about your organization's data, as captured during daily snapshots.

**New or updated features**

| Feature | Description |
| ------- | ----------- |
| Send as Email Export Option | You can now export up to 10,000 records from Query Pro mode dashboards by selecting **[!UICONTROL Send as email]** from the **[!UICONTROL View more]** menu. This option securely sends a download link to your Adobe-associated email for larger exports. Read the [view more guide](../../dashboards/sql-insights-query-pro-mode/view-more.md#export) for more information. |

For more information on dashboards, including how to grant access permissions and create custom widgets, begin by reading the [dashboards overview](../../dashboards/home.md).

## Data Governance {#data-governance}

Adobe Experience Platform Data Governance is a series of strategies and technologies used to manage customer data and ensure compliance with regulations, restrictions, and policies applicable to data usage. It plays a key role within [!DNL Experience Platform] at various levels, including cataloging, data lineage, data usage labeling, data access policies, and access control on data for marketing actions.

**New features**

| Feature | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Azure CMK Alerts and IP Allowlist Configuration | You can now allowlist Adobe's static IP address in Azure Key Vault to ensure continued access when network restrictions are enabled. This helps prevent disruptions to Platform services due to restricted key access. |
| CMK Configuration Alerts and Resolutions  | Experience Platform now triggers alerts when Adobe services lose access to your Azure Key Vault (for example, due to removed IP allowlist entries or disabled keys). A new guide helps you understand each alert and take corrective action. |

For more information, read the [data governance overview](../../data-governance/home.md).

## Destinations {#destinations}

[!DNL Destinations] are pre-built integrations with destination platforms that allow for the seamless activation of data from Adobe Experience Platform. You can use destinations to activate your known and unknown data for cross-channel marketing campaigns, email campaigns, targeted advertising, and many other use cases.

**New destinations**
