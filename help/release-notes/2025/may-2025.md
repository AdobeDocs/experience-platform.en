| Support for import and export mappings for Adobe Analytics | You can now use import and export mapping capabilities for your Adobe Analytics report suite data when using the Adobe Analytics source connector. Export your mappings to a CSV file and configure them locally on a spreadsheet. You can then import your updated mappings to Experience Platform using the mapping interface in the UI. You can use this capability to configure large numbers of mappings without having to manually build them in the UI. Additionally, when creating a new dataflow, you can upload a copy of your mappings directly to Experience Platform to accelerate your workflow.
