## Sources {#sources}

Experience Platform provides a RESTful API and an interactive UI that lets you set up source connections for various data providers with ease. These source connections allow you to authenticate and connect to external storage systems and CRM services, set times for ingestion runs, and manage data ingestion throughput.

Use sources in Experience Platform to ingest data from an Adobe application or a third-party data source.
