| --- | --- |
| Bulk actions | The dataset inventory now supports bulk actions. Streamline your data management processes and ensure the efficient management of your datasets with bulk actions. Use bulk actions to save time by performing multiple actions on numerous datasets simultaneously.  Bulk actions include [Move to folder](../../catalog/datasets/user-guide.md#move-to-folders), [Edit tags](../../catalog/datasets/user-guide.md#manage-tags), and [Delete](../../catalog/datasets/user-guide.md#delete) datasets. <br> ![Bulk actions in the Datasets UI workspace.](../2024/assets/may/bulk-actions.png "Bulk actions in the Datasets UI workspace."){width="100" zoomable="yes"} <br> For more information about this feature, read the [Datasets UI guide](../../catalog/datasets/user-guide.md#bulk-actions). |

## Data Governance {#governance}

Adobe Experience Platform Data Governance is a series of strategies and technologies used to manage customer data and ensure compliance with regulations, restrictions, and policies applicable to data usage. It plays a key role within [!DNL Experience Platform] at various levels, including cataloging, data lineage, data usage labeling, data access policies, and access control on data for marketing actions.

**New features**

| Feature | Description |
| --- | --- |
| mTLS support for HTTP API destinations and Adobe Journey Optimizer custom actions | Build customer trust with the strengthened security measures of the Mutual Transport Layer Security (mTLS) protocol. The [Experience Platform HTTP API destination](../../destinations/catalog/streaming/http-destination.md#mtls-protocol-support) and [Adobe Journey Optimizer custom actions](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/journey-optimizer/using/orchestrate-journeys/about-journey-building/using-custom-actions) now support the mTLS protocol when sending data to configured endpoints. No additional configuration is required in your custom action or HTTP API destination to activate mTLS; this process occurs automatically when an mTLS-enabled endpoint is detected. You can [download the Adobe Journey Optimizer public certificate here](../../landing/governance-privacy-security/encryption.md#download-certificates) and the [Destinations Service public certificate here](../../landing/governance-privacy-security/encryption.md#download-certificates).<br>See the [Experience Platform data encryption documentation](../../landing/governance-privacy-security/encryption.md#mtls-protocol-support) for more information on network connection protocols when exporting data to third-party systems. |
