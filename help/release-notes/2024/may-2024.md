## Documentation updates {#documentation-updates}

### Interactive Experience Platform API documentation {#interactive-api-documentation}

**Updated documentation**

The [Experience Platform API documentation](https://developer.adobe.com/experience-platform-apis/) is now interactive. All the API reference pages now have a **Try it** functionality, which allows you to test API calls directly on the documentation website page. [Get the required authentication credentials](/help/landing/api-authentication.md) and start using the functionality to explore the API endpoints. 

This new functionality allows you to explore the requests to and the responses from API endpoints, to get immediate feedback and speed up your technical implementation. For example, visit the [Identity Service API](https://developer.adobe.com/experience-platform-apis/references/identity-service/) or the [Schema Registry API](https://developer.adobe.com/experience-platform-apis/references/schema-registry/) endpoints to explore the new **Try it** functionality in the right rail.

>[!CAUTION]

>Note that by using the interactive API functionality on the documentation pages, you are making real API calls to the endpoints, so keep that in mind when experimenting with production sandboxes.

## Segmentation Service {#segmentation}

[!DNL Segmentation Service] allows you to segment data stored in [!DNL Experience Platform] that relates to individuals (such as customers, prospects, users, or organizations) into audiences.

## Sources {#sources}

Experience Platform provides a RESTful API and an interactive UI that lets you set up source connections for various data providers with ease. These source connections allow you to authenticate and connect to external storage systems and CRM services, set times for ingestion runs, and manage data ingestion throughput.

Use sources in Experience Platform to ingest data from an Adobe application or a third-party data source.
