## Data Governance {#governance}

Adobe Experience Platform Data Governance is a series of strategies and technologies used to manage customer data and ensure compliance with regulations, restrictions, and policies applicable to data usage. It plays a key role within [!DNL Experience Platform] at various levels, including cataloging, data lineage, data usage labeling, data access policies, and access control on data for marketing actions.

| mTLS support for HTTP API destinations and Adobe Journey Optimizer custom actions | Build customer trust with the strengthened security measures of the Mutual Transport Layer Security (mTLS) protocol. The [Experience Platform HTTP API destination](../../destinations/catalog/streaming/http-destination.md#mtls-protocol-support) and [Adobe Journey Optimizer custom actions](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/journey-optimizer/using/orchestrate-journeys/about-journey-building/using-custom-actions) now support the mTLS protocol when sending data to configured endpoints. No additional configuration is required in your custom action or HTTP API destination to activate mTLS; this process occurs automatically when an mTLS-enabled endpoint is detected. You can [download the Adobe Journey Optimizer public certificate here](../../data-governance/images/enforcement/AJO-public-certificate.pem) and the [Destinations Service public certificate here](../../data-governance/images/enforcement/destinations-public-cert.pem).<br>See the [Experience Platform data encryption documentation](../../landing/governance-privacy-security/encryption.md#mtls-protocol-support) for more information on network connection protocols when exporting data to third-party systems. |

## Documentation updates {#documentation-updates}

### Interactive Experience Platform API documentation {#interactive-api-documentation}

The [Experience Platform API documentation](https://developer.adobe.com/experience-platform-apis/) is now interactive. All the API reference pages now have a **Try it** .functionality that you can use to test API calls directly on the documentation website page. [Get the required authentication credentials](/help/landing/api-authentication.md) and start using the functionality to explore the API endpoints. 

Use this new functionality to explore the requests to and the responses from API endpoints, to get immediate feedback and speed up your technical implementation. For example, visit the [Identity Service API](https://developer.adobe.com/experience-platform-apis/references/identity-service/) or the [Schema Registry API](https://developer.adobe.com/experience-platform-apis/references/schema-registry/) endpoints to explore the new **Try it** functionality in the right rail.

>[!CAUTION]
>
>Be aware that by using the interactive API functionality on the documentation pages, you are making real API calls to the endpoints. Keep this in mind when experimenting with production sandboxes.

### Personalized insights and engagement {#personalized-insights-engagement}

A new end-to-end use case documentation page for [evolving one-time value to lifetime value](/help/rtcdp/use-case-guides/evolve-one-time-value-lifetime-value/evolve-one-time-value-to-lifetime-value.md) is now live.
