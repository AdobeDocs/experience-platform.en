**New or updated features**

| Feature | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Real-Time Customer Data Platform B2B insights | Explore pre-configured [Real-Time CDP B2B data insights on accounts and opportunities](../../dashboards/insights/account-profiles.md) to help you understand your data and inform your business decisions. You can also [build your own insights using the Real-Time CDP B2B Data Model](../../dashboards/data-models/cdp-insights-data-model-b2c.md) to visualize and explore your data and save your custom visualizations in your dashboard. |

{style="table-layout:auto"}

For more information on dashboards, including how to grant access permissions and create custom widgets, begin by reading the [dashboards overview](../../dashboards/home.md).

## Data collection {#data-collection}

Adobe Experience Platform provides a suite of technologies that allow you to collect client-side customer experience data and send it to the Experience Platform Edge Network where it can be enriched, transformed, and distributed to Adobe or non-Adobe destinations.

**New or updated features**

| Type | Feature | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Extensions | [!DNL Acxiom Anonymous Visitor Insights] Tags Extension | Discover where your website visitors are coming from with [!DNL Acxiom's Visitor Insights]. By utilizing geo IP lookup technology, Acxiom can pinpoint the location of anonymous browsers. Once identified, a search in their organized database yields additional insights that are sent back to the browser. Content creators can thereby tailor their content to match these data points providing a more personalized and engaging experience for visitors, even if they started off as strangers. |
| Datastreams | [Edge Network bot detection](../../datastreams/bot-detection.md) | Traffic originating from nonhuman entities, such as automated programs, web scrapers, spiders, scripted scanners, can make it more difficult to identify events occuring from human visitors. This type of traffic can negatively affect important business metrics, leading to incorrect traffic reporting. <br>Bot detection allows you to identify events generated by [Adobe Experience Platform Data Collection](/help/collection/home.md) as being generated by known spiders and bots. By configuring bot detection for your datastreams, you can identify specific IP addresses, IP ranges and request headers which you would like to classified as bot events. <br> Identification of bot traffic can provide you with a more accurate measurement of user activity on your site or mobile application. |
| Mobile SDK | Major version release | New major versions of the Mobile SDK have been released for the following platforms: iOS Mobile Core 5.x and compatible iOS extensions, Android Mobile Core 3.x and compatible Android extensions, React Native Core 6.x and compatible React Native extensions, Flutter Core 4.x and compatible Flutter extensions. These release provide several new features and enhancements including support in the Android SDK for Jetpack Compose, support for Adobe Journey Optimizer code-based experiences, and general availability of the Adobe Journey Optimizer Messaging extension for Flutter. For more detailed release notes see [Mobile SDK release notes](https://developer.adobe.com/client-sdks/home/release-notes/).|
| Mobile SDK | Privacy | Due to Apple's policy update, starting on May 1, 2024, developers must implement new privacy features in order to submit to the App Store. All Adobe customers who use the Mobile SDK will need to upgrade to version 5.x of the SDK if they wish to receive App Store approval after May 1st. |
| Roku SDK | Roku SDK | The first major version of the Roku SDK has been released with support for the Streaming Media for the Experience Platform Edge Network. |
| Tags and Event Forwarding | In-product guidance | Experience Platform [Tags](../../tags/home.md) and [Event Forwarding](../../tags/ui/event-forwarding/overview.md) offer a new range of experiences that can help you get started quickly and realize a quick time to value. These experiences include new onboarding screens, in-product tutorials, and tool tips. <br>![Event Forwarding with the in-product guidance highlighted.](../2024/assets/april/event-forwarding.png "The Schemas Editor with the Type and Map value type fields highlighted."){width="100" zoomable="yes"}<br>|
| Web SDK | Simplified Web SDK adoption for Audience Manager customers | Multiple Web SDK updates now simplify adoption of Web SDK without using Experience Data Model (XDM) for Experience Cloud Solutions, such as Audience Manager, Analytics and Target. Learn more about Audience Manager Web SDK adoption from the following guides: <ul><li><a href="https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/audience-manager/user-guide/migrate-to-web-sdk/dil-extension-to-web-sdk">Update your data collection library for Audience Manager from the Audience Manager tag extension to the Web SDK tag extension</li><li><a href="https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/audience-manager/user-guide/migrate-to-web-sdk/appmeasurement-to-web-sdk">Update your data collection library for Audience Manager from the AppMeasurement JavaScript library to the Web SDK JavaScript library</li></ul>|

{style="table-layout:auto"}

<!--| Web SDK | [Streaming Media Collection support in Web SDK](/help/collection/js/commands/configure/streamingmedia.md) | You can now use Experience Platform Web SDK to collect data related to media sessions on your website. The collected data can include information about media playbacks, pauses, completions, and other related events. Once collected, you can send this data to Adobe Experience Platform and/or Adobe Analytics, to generate reports. This feature provides a comprehensive solution for tracking and understanding media consumption behavior on your website. <br>See the [Web SDK](/help/collection/js/commands/configure/streamingmedia.md) documentation to learn how to configure the `streamingMedia` component. <br>See the guide on [migrating your Analytics for Streaming Media implementation from Media JS to Web SDK](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/media-analytics/using/implementation/edge-recommended/media-edge-sdk/edge-web-sdk) for more details.|-->

## Destinations {#destinations}

[!DNL Destinations] are pre-built integrations with destination platforms that allow for the seamless activation of data from Adobe Experience Platform. You can use destinations to activate your known and unknown data for cross-channel marketing campaigns, email campaigns, targeted advertising, and many other use cases.

**New or updated functionality** {#destinations-new-updated-functionality}

| Functionality | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| `isRequired` parameter now available for nested customer data fields in Destination SDK | When configuring a destination in Destination SDK, you can now [set nested customer data fields as required](/help/destinations/destination-sdk/functionality/destination-configuration/customer-data-fields.md#nested-fields). This way, users setting up your destination cannot proceed with their activation flow until they select a value for that field.|
| Edge segmentation is not a mandatory requirement anymore when setting up an Adobe Target destination with Web SDK | Previously, when configuring an [Adobe Target destination](/help/destinations/catalog/personalization/adobe-target-connection.md) with Web SDK, the datastream had to be enabled for personalization and edge segmentation. The requirement that the datastream be enabled for edge segmentation [has now been removed](/help/destinations/ui/activate-edge-personalization-destinations.md#configure-datastream). Note that this integration pattern only allows you to benefit from a subset of personalization use cases when using Adobe Target with Real-Time CDP. Read more about the [use cases enabled by integration type](/help/destinations/catalog/personalization/adobe-target-connection.md#supported-use-cases). |
| [!BADGE Beta]{type=Informative} Remove multiple audiences and datasets from activation flows | You can now select and remove multiple audiences and datasets from destination activation flows. See the [destination details](../../destinations/ui/destination-details-page.md#bulk-remove) and [dataset export](../../destinations/ui/export-datasets.md) documentation for more details. |
