For more information on dashboards, including how to grant access permissions and create custom widgets, begin by reading the [dashboards overview](../../dashboards/home.md).

## Data collection {#data-collection}

Adobe Experience Platform provides a suite of technologies that allow you to collect client-side customer experience data and send it to the Experience Platform Edge Network where it can be enriched, transformed, and distributed to Adobe or non-Adobe destinations.

**New or updated features**

| Type | Feature | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Insights | [!DNL Acxiom] Anonymous Visitor Insights | Discover where your website visitors are coming from with [!DNL Acxiom's] Visitor Insights. By utilizing geo IP lookup technology, we pinpoint the location of anonymous browsers. Once identified, a quick search in our organized database yields additional insights that are sent back to the browser. For content creators, this means a golden opportunity to tailor their content to match these data points providing a more personalized and engaging experience for visitors, even if they started off as strangers. |
| Datastreams | [Edge Network bot detection](../../datastreams/bot-detection.md) | Traffic originating from nonhuman entities, such as automated programs, web scrapers, spiders, scripted scanners, can make it more difficult to identify events occuring from human visitors. This type of traffic can negatively affect important business metrics, leading to incorrect traffic reporting. <br>Bot detection allows you to identify events generated by the [Web SDK](../../web-sdk/home.md), [Mobile SDK](https://developer.adobe.com/client-sdks/home/) and [[!DNL Server API]](../../server-api/overview.md) as being generated by known spiders and bots. By configuring bot detection for your datastreams, you can identify specific IP addresses, IP ranges and request headers which you would like to classified as bot events. <br> Identification of bot traffic can provide you with a more accurate measurement of user activity on your site or mobile application. |
| Mobile SDK | Major version release | New major versions of the Mobile SDK have been released for the following platforms: iOS Mobile Core 5.x and compatible iOS extensions, Android Mobile Core 3.x and compatible Android extensions, React Native Core 6.x and compatible React Native extensions, Flutter Core 4.x and compatible Flutter extensions. These release provide several new features and enhancements including support in the Android SDK for Jetpack Compose, support for Adobe Journey Optimizer code-based experiences, and general availability of the Adobe Journey Optimizer Messaging extension for Flutter. For more detailed release notes see [Mobile SDK release notes](https://developer.adobe.com/client-sdks/home/release-notes/).|
| Mobile SDK | Privacy | Due to Apple's policy update, starting on May 1, 2024, developers must implement new privacy features in order to submit to the App Store. All Adobe customers who use the Mobile SDK will need to upgrade to version 5.x of the SDK if they wish to receive App Store approval after May 1st. |
| Roku SDK | Roku SDK | The first major version of the Roku SDK has been released with support for the Streaming Media for the Platform Edge Network. |
| Tags and Event Forwarding | In-product guidance | Experience Platform [Tags](../../tags/home.md) and [Event Forwarding](../../tags/ui/event-forwarding/overview.md) offer a new range of experiences that can help you get started quickly and realize a quick time to value. These experiences include new onboarding screens, in-product tutorials, and tool tips. <br>![Event Forwarding with the in-product guidance highlighted.](../2024/assets/april/event-forwarding.png "The Schemas Editor with the Type and Map value type fields highlighted."){width="100" zoomable="yes"}<br>|
| Web SDK | Simplified Web SDK adoption for Audience Manager customers | Multiple Web SDK updates now simplify adoption of Web SDK without using Experience Data Model (XDM) for Experience Cloud Solutions, such as Audience Manager, Analytics and Target. Learn more about Audience Manager Web SDK adoption from the following guides: <ul><li><a href="https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/audience-manager/user-guide/migrate-to-web-sdk/dil-extension-to-web-sdk">Update your data collection library for Audience Manager from the Audience Manager tag extension to the Web SDK tag extension</li><li><a href="https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/audience-manager/user-guide/migrate-to-web-sdk/appmeasurement-to-web-sdk">Update your data collection library for Audience Manager from the AppMeasurement JavaScript library to the Web SDK JavaScript library</li></ul>|

{style="table-layout:auto"}

<!--| Web SDK | [Streaming Media Collection support in Web SDK](../../web-sdk/commands/configure/streamingmedia.md) | You can now use Experience Platform Web SDK to collect data related to media sessions on your website. The collected data can include information about media playbacks, pauses, completions, and other related events. Once collected, you can send this data to Adobe Experience Platform and/or Adobe Analytics, to generate reports. This feature provides a comprehensive solution for tracking and understanding media consumption behavior on your website. <br>See the [Web SDK](../../web-sdk/commands/configure/streamingmedia.md) documentation to learn how to configure the `streamingMedia` component. <br>See the guide on [migrating your Analytics for Streaming Media implementation from Media JS to Web SDK](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/media-analytics/using/implementation/edge-recommended/media-edge-sdk/edge-web-sdk) for more details.|-->

## Sandboxes {#sandboxes}

Adobe Experience Platform is built to enrich digital experience applications on a global scale. Companies often run multiple digital experience applications in parallel and need to cater for the development, testing, and deployment of these applications while ensuring operational compliance. To address this need, Experience Platform provides sandboxes that partition a single Platform instance into separate virtual environments to help develop and evolve digital experience applications.
