**Release date: August 20, 2024**

Updates to existing features and documentation in Experience Platform:

- [Identity Service](#identity-service)
- [Sources](#sources)

## Identity Service {#identity-service}

Use Adobe Experience Platform Identity Service to create a comprehensive view of your customers and their behaviors by bridging identities across devices and systems, allowing you to deliver impactful, personal digital experiences in real time.

**Updated documentation**

| Feature | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Graph configurations guide | Read the [graph configurations guide](../../identity-service/identity-graph-linking-rules/example-configurations.md) for information on common graph scenarios that you might encounter while working with identity graph linking rules and identity data. The graph configurations guide provides examples ranging from simple single-person graph scenarios to complex and hierarchical multi-person graph scenarios. You can also use the guide for examples of events and algorithm configurations that you can input in the [graph simulation UI](../../identity-service/identity-graph-linking-rules/graph-simulation.md), as well as breakdowns of how primary identities are selected given certain graph scenarios.  |

For more information on Identity Service, read the [Identity Service overview](../../identity-service/home.md).

## Sources

Experience Platform provides a RESTful API and an interactive UI that lets you set up source connections for various data providers with ease. These source connections allow you to authenticate and connect to external storage systems and CRM services, set times for ingestion runs, and manage data ingestion throughput.

Use sources in Experience Platform to ingest data from an Adobe application or a third-party data source.

**Updated documentation**

| Updated documentation | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Expanded documentation on updating dataflows | The guide on [updating existing sources dataflows in the UI](../../sources/tutorials/ui/update-dataflows.md) has been updated to provide more information on the variety of configurations you can make to an existing dataflow. The guide has also been updated to clarify the expected behavior when a disabled dataflow is re-enabled. |
