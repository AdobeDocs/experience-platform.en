## Authentication to Experience Platform APIs {#authentication-platform-apis}

The JWT method to obtain access tokens is now deprecated for new integrations and replaced by a simpler OAuth Server-to-Server authentication method.<p>![New OAuth authentication method to get access tokens highlighted.](/help/landing/images/api-authentication/oauth-authentication-method.png "New OAuth authentication method to get access tokens highlighted."){width="100" zoomable="yes"}</p> 

While existing API integrations using the JWT authentication method will continue to work until January 1st, 2025, Adobe strongly recommends that you migrate existing integrations to the new OAuth Server-to-Server method before that date. Read the guide on [migrating from Service Account (JWT) credential to OAuth Server-to-Server credential](https://developer.adobe.com/developer-console/docs/guides/authentication/ServerToServerAuthentication/migration/).
