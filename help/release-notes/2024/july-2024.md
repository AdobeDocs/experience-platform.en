## Federated Audience Composition {#federated-audience-composition}

Federated Audience Composition allows enterprises to compose data for better application across various use cases. With this new approach, as an Adobe Real-Time Customer Data Platform and/or Adobe Journey Optimizer user, you can federate datasets directly from your existing data warehouse to create and enrich Adobe Experience Platform audiences and attributes all in one system.

For more information, read the [Federated Audience Composition documentation](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/federated-audience-composition/using/home).

## Advanced data lifecycle management {#advanced-data-lifecycle-management}

Experience Platform provides a suite of data hygiene capabilities that allow you to manage your stored data through programmatic deletions of consumer records and datasets. Using either the Data Lifecycle workspace in the UI or through calls to the Data Hygiene API, you can effectively manage your data stores. Use these capabilities to ensure that information is used as expected, is updated when incorrect data needs fixing, and is deleted when organizational policies deem it necessary.
