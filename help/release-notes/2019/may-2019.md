## [!DNL Experience Data Model] (XDM) {#xdm}

Standardization and interoperability are key concepts behind [!DNL Experience Platform]. [!DNL Experience Data Model] (XDM), driven by Adobe, is an effort to standardize customer experience data and define schemas for customer experience management.

XDM is a publicly documented specification designed to improve the power of digital experiences. It provides common structures and definitions for any application to communicate with services on Adobe Experience Platform. By adhering to XDM standards, all customer experience data can be incorporated into a common representation delivering insights in a faster, more integrated way. You can gain valuable insights from customer actions, define customer audiences through segments, and use customer attributes for personalization purposes.

XDM is the mechanism that allows [!DNL Experience Clou]d, powered by Adobe Experience Platform, to deliver the right message to the right person, on the right channel, at exactly the right moment.

The methodology on which [!DNL Experience Platform] is built, [!DNL XDM System] operationalizes [!DNL Experience Data Model] schemas for use by [!DNL Experience Platform] components.

| Feature    | Description  |
| -----------| ---------- |
| [!DNL Schema Registry] | The [!DNL Schema Registry] provides a user interface ([!DNL Schema Editor]) and RESTful API from which all schema-related resources can be viewed and managed. The [!DNL Schema Editor] and [!DNL Schema Registry] API can also be used to create and manage new schemas and resources that are unique to each organization. |
| [!DNL Schema Library]  | The [!DNL Schema Library] contains all [!DNL Schema Registry] resources, including those defined by an individual organization and those made available to all users by Adobe, [!DNL Experience Platform] partners, and vendors whose applications are integrated with [!DNL Experience Platform]. |

**Known issues**

None.

To learn more about working with XDM using the [!DNL Schema Registry] API and [!DNL Schema Editor], please read the [XDM System documentation](../../xdm/home.md).

## [!DNL Real-Time Customer Profile] {#profile}

[!DNL Profile] is a generic lookup entity store that merges data across various enterprise data assets and provides access to that data in the form of real-time consumer profiles, and related time series events, called the union view. The unified view helps to inform and empower actions across channels, [!DNL Platform], and Adobe solution integrations. Furthermore, [!DNL Profile] is used to power machine learning & Sensei. [!DNL Profile] APIs can also be used directly to enrich the functionality of third-party solutions, CRM systems, and proprietary solutions.

| Feature    | Description  |
| -----------| ---------- |
| [!DNL Real-time customer profile]  | [!DNL Profile] ingests data via data inlets, merges it with existing data in the profile store, and creates or modifies the unified view at near real time. This data, evolving in time with your customers' experiences, can be used to make personalized recommendations. |
| Union view | One of the key features of [!DNL Profile] is the ability to unify multi-channel data. [!DNL Profile] can supply a merged view of the individuals in your consumer base, across datasets, and for linked identities, referred to as the union view. |
| Edge | Edge Service serves as a framework for low-latency data collection, pluggable computing and rapid data activation across all addressable channels. Edge Service facilitates real-time personalization. |

**Known issues**

None.

For product documentation, see [Profile Overview](../../profile/home.md).

## Identity Service {#identity}

Identity Service solves the fundamental challenge posed by the disconnected identities of your customers, caused by the fragmented nature of their data across each of the disparate systems at play in your organization's ecosystem. It does this by bridging identities across devices and across the various systems used by your consumers to engage with your brand. In this way, Identity Service facilitates a complete understanding of your customers and their behavior so you can deliver impactful digital experiences in real time.

| Feature    | Description  |
| -----------| ---------- |
| Identity graph  | An identity graph is a map of relationships between identities that updates with customer activity in near real time. [!DNL Identity Service] manages an identity graph visible by only your organization, and built based on your data, referred to as the private graph. [!DNL Identity Service] augments your private graph when a record of ingested data contains more than one identity, adding relationships between these identities. |

**Known issues**

None.

For product documentation, see [Identity Service Overview](../../identity-service/home.md).

## [!DNL Segmentation Service] {#segmentation}

[!DNL Segmentation Service] defines a particular subset of profiles from your profile store, describing the criteria that distinguishes a marketable group of people within your profile store. Segments can be based on record data (such as demographic information) or time series events representing customer touch points with your brand.

For example, in an email campaign called "Did you forget to buy your sneakers?," you might want an audience segment of all users who searched for running shoes within the last 30 days, but who did not complete a purchase. Or, you might want to target web content to display only to users with a certain rating in your rewards program.

| Feature    | Description  |
| -----------| ---------- |
| Segmentation API  | RESTful services give you programmatic access to build customer segments. |
| Segment Builder  | The segment builder is a robust and intuitive workspace for building customer segments from your [!DNL Profile] data. |

**Known issues**

None.

For product documentation, see the [Segmentation Service overview](../../segmentation/home.md)

## Data Governance {#governance}

Adobe Experience Platform allows companies to bring data from multiple enterprise systems together to better allow marketers to identify, understand, and engage customers. [!DNL Experience Platform] includes an end-to-end data governance infrastructure to ensure the proper use of data within [!DNL Platform] and when being shared between systems.

Data governance is a series of strategies and technologies used to manage customer data and ensure compliance with regulations, restrictions, and policies applicable to data usage. It plays a key role within [!DNL Experience Platform] at various levels, including cataloging, data lineage, data usage labeling, data access policies, and access control on data for marketing actions.

Getting started with data governance requires a thorough understanding of the regulations, contractual obligations, and corporate policies that apply to your customer data. From there, data can be classified by applying the appropriate data usage labels, and its use can be controlled through the definition of data usage policies.

The Data Governance framework simplifies and streamlines the process of categorizing data and creating data usage policies through the [!DNL Experience Platform] user interface and [!DNL Policy Service] API. 

| Feature    | Description  |
| -----------| ---------- |
| Label [!DNL Experience Platform] entities  | Apply and manage data usage labels at the connection, dataset, and dataset field level based on predefined categorized labels. |
| Create data usage policies  | Define and manage data usage policies based on the presence of labels and requested marketing actions. |
| Check policy violations  | Evaluate whether defined usage policies are violated when performing marketing actions on [!DNL Platform] data. |

**Known issues**

* None.

For more information, please see the [Data Governance overview](../../data-governance/home.md)).
