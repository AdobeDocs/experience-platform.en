## Alerts {#alerts}

Experience Platform allows you to subscribe to event-based alerts for various Platform activities. You can subscribe to different alert rules through the [!UICONTROL Alerts] tab in the Platform user interface, and can choose to receive alert messages within the UI itself or through email notifications.

**New or updated features**

| Feature | Description |

## Data collection {#data-collection}

Adobe Experience Platform provides a suite of technologies that allow you to collect client-side customer experience data and send it to the Adobe Experience Platform Edge Network where it can be enriched, transformed, and distributed to Adobe or non-Adobe destinations.

Choosing to collect device information will disable the collection of user agent and client hints, and vice versa. All device lookup information is stored in the `xdm:device` field group. Learn more from the documentation on [configuring datastreams](../../datastreams/configure.md#geolocation-device-lookup). |
| Extensions | [!DNL TikTok] web events API extension | The [[!DNL TikTok] Web Events API](https://exchange.adobe.com/apps/ec/109834/tiktok-web-events-api) extension allows you to leverage data captured in the Adobe Experience Platform Edge Network and send it to [!DNL TikTok] in the form of server-side events using the [!DNL TikTok] Web Events API. |

**New or updated features**

| Feature | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Identity Service UI enhancements | Use the improved custom namespace creation tool in the Experience Platform UI to better manage your custom namespaces and their corresponding identity types. The enhanced Identity Service UI provides you with: <ul><li>Contextual Experience: Visual cues, clarity, and context to what an identity namespace is and identity types are.</li><li>Accuracy: Better error handling, with no more duplicate identity names.</li><li>Discoverability: Access to documentation from within an in-product dialog.</li></ul> For more information, read the guide on [creating custom namespaces](../../identity-service/features/namespaces.md#create-namespaces). |
| Changes to identity graph limits | The identity graph limit has changed from 150 identities to 50 identities. When a new identity is ingested into a full graph, the oldest identity based on the ingestion timestamp and identity type are deleted. Cookie identity types are prioritized for deletion. Please contact your Adobe Account Team to request a change in identity type if your production sandbox contains: <ul><li>a custom namespace where the person identifiers (such as CRM IDs) are configured as cookie/device identity type.</li><li>a custom namespace where cookie/device identifiers are configured as cross-device identity type.</li></ul> Adobe engineering will manually process these requests. For more information, read the [guardrails for Identity Service data](../../identity-service/guardrails.md) and guide on [data management license entitlement best practices](../../landing/license-usage-and-guardrails/data-management-best-practices.md). |

| Feature | Description |
| --- | --- |
| New parameters for `offset` pagination in Self-Serve Sources (Batch SDK) | You can now specify an `endConditionName` and `endConditionValue` for your source when using `offset` pagination.
