## Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning Services {#ai-ml}
 
Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning services empower marketing analysts and practitioners to leverage the power of AI/ML in customer experience use cases. This allows for marketing analysts to set up predictions, without the need for data science expertise, specific to a company's needs using business-level configurations.
 
### Attribution AI
 
Attribution AI is used to attribute credits to touchpoints that lead to conversion events. This can be used by marketers to help quantify the marketing impact of each individual marketing touchpoint across customer journeys.
 
**Updated features**
 
| Feature | Description |
| ------- | ----------- |
| HIPAA readiness | Healthcare Shield customers can now receive, use, maintain, or transmit protected health information in Attribution AI and certain other Experience Platform-based applications. Healthcare Shield is for healthcare customers that are either a covered entity or business associate under HIPAA. For more information, read the documentation on [HIPAA and Adobe Products and Services](https://www.adobe.com/trust/compliance/hipaa-ready.html)|
|Edit additional score dataset columns | You can now add or remove additional score dataset columns (reporting columns) when you edit existing models. This extends the flexibility of the attribution scores to provide you with insights to additional dimensions after a model has already been created. See the [Attribution UI guide](../../intelligent-services/attribution-ai/user-guide.md) to learn more.|

{style="table-layout:auto"}

## Destinations (updated February 2nd) {#destinations}

[!DNL Destinations] are pre-built integrations with destination platforms that allow for the seamless activation of data from Adobe Experience Platform. You can use destinations to activate your known and unknown data for cross-channel marketing campaigns, email campaigns, targeted advertising, and many other use cases.

**New destinations**

| Destination | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| [(Beta) Adobe Experience Cloud Audiences connection](../../destinations/catalog/adobe/experience-cloud-audiences.md) | Use the [!UICONTROL (Beta) Adobe Experience Cloud Audiences] connection to share segments from Experience Platform to various Experience Platform solutions, like Audience Manager, Analytics, Advertising Cloud, Adobe Campaign, Target, or Marketo. |
| [Pega Profile connection](../../destinations/catalog/personalization/pega-profile.md) | Use the [!DNL Pega Profile Connector] in Adobe Experience Platform to create a live outbound connection to your [!DNL Amazon] S3 storage to periodically export profile data to CSV files from Adobe Experience Platform into your own S3 buckets. In [!DNL Pega Customer Decision Hub], you can schedule data jobs to import this profile data from S3 storage to update the [!DNL Pega Customer Decision Hub] profile. |
| [(Beta) The Trade Desk CRM EU connection](../../destinations/catalog/advertising/tradedesk-emails.md) | With the release of EUID (European Unified ID), you are now seeing two [!DNL The Trade Desk - CRM] destinations in the [destinations catalog](/help/destinations/catalog/overview.md). <ul><li> If you source data in the EU, please use the **[!DNL The Trade Desk - CRM (EU)]** destination.</li><li> If you source data in the APAC or NAMER regions, please use the **[!DNL The Trade Desk - CRM (NAMER & APAC)]** destination. </li></ul> |

**New or updated functionality** {#destinations-new-updated-functionality}

| Functionality | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Paid Media Consent Policy enhancement for integrations with streaming destinations | An [enhancement to consent policy enforcement](/help/data-governance/enforcement/auto-enforcement.md#consent-policy-enhancement) on [streaming destinations](/help/destinations/destination-types.md#streaming-destinations) for paid media activation use-cases. When profiles are no longer qualified for a consent policy, Experience Platform now proactively communicates their policy exit to streaming destinations. <br> <b>Note</b>: This functionality is available only to customers of **[!UICONTROL Privacy and Security Shield]**, and those of **[!UICONTROL Healthcare Shield]**. |
| New delimiter options for beta cloud storage destination connectors | Three new delimiter options (Colon `:`, Pipe, Semicolon `;`) are now available for the new beta cloud storage destinations - [(Beta) Amazon S3](/help/destinations/catalog/cloud-storage/amazon-s3.md), [(Beta) Azure Blob](/help/destinations/catalog/cloud-storage/azure-blob.md), [(Beta) Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2](/help/destinations/catalog/cloud-storage/adls-gen2.md), [(Beta) Data Landing Zone](/help/destinations/catalog/cloud-storage/data-landing-zone.md), [(Beta) Google Cloud Storage](/help/destinations/catalog/cloud-storage/google-cloud-storage.md), [(Beta) SFTP](/help/destinations/catalog/cloud-storage/sftp.md). <br> Read about the supported [file formatting options](/help/destinations/ui/batch-destinations-file-formatting-options.md) for file-based destinations. |
| New optional parameter available in [customer data fields](/help/destinations/destination-sdk/functionality/destination-configuration/customer-data-fields.md) configurations in [Destination SDK](/help/destinations/destination-sdk/overview.md) | `unique`: Use this parameter when you need to create a customer data field whose value must be unique across all destination dataflows set up by a user's organization. <br> For example, the **[!UICONTROL Integration alias]** field in the [[!UICONTROL Custom Personalization]](/help/destinations/catalog/personalization/custom-personalization.md#parameters) destination must be unique, meaning that two separate dataflows to this destination cannot have the same value for this field. |

## Real-Time Customer Profile {#profile}

Adobe Experience Platform enables you to drive coordinated, consistent, and relevant experiences for your customers no matter where or when they interact with your brand. With Real-Time Customer Profile, you can see a holistic view of each individual customer that combines data from multiple channels, including online, offline, CRM, and third party data. Profile allows you to consolidate customer data into a unified view offering an actionable, timestamped account of every customer interaction.

**Upcoming deprecation** {#deprecation}

In order to remove redundancy in the segment membership lifecycle, the `Existing` status will be deprecated from the [segment membership map](../../xdm/field-groups/profile/segmentation.md) at the end of March 2023. A follow-up announcement will include the exact deprecation date. 

Post deprecation, profiles qualified in a segment will be represented as `Realized` and profiles disqualified will continue to be represented as `Exited`. This will bring parity with file-based destinations with `Active` and `Expired` segment statuses. 

This change could impact you if you're using [enterprise destinations](../../destinations/destination-types.md#streaming-profile-export) (Amazon Kinesis, Azure Event Hubs, HTTP API) and have automated downstream processes in place, based on the `Existing` status. Please review your downstream integrations if this is the case for you. If you are interested in identifying newly qualified profiles beyond a certain time, please consider using a combination of the `Realized` status and the `lastQualificationTime` in your segment membership map. For more information, please reach out to your Adobe representative.

To learn more about Real-Time Customer Profile, including tutorials and best practices for working with profile data, please begin by reading the [Real-Time Customer Profile overview](../../profile/home.md).

## Segmentation Service {#segmentation}

[!DNL Segmentation Service] defines a particular subset of profiles by describing the criteria that distinguishes a marketable group of people within your customer base. Segments can be based on record data (such as demographic information) or time series events representing customer interactions with your brand.

**New or updated features**

| Feature | Description |
| ------- | ----------- |
| Bulk value import in Segment Builder | Segment Builder now supports importing multiple values, either by uploading a CSV or TSV file or by manually inserting comma separated values. More information can be found within the [Segment Builder guide](../../segmentation/ui/segment-builder.md#rule-builder-canvas). |
| External audience membership expiration | By default, external audience memberships are retained for 30 days. To retain them for longer, use the `validUntil` field during the ingestion of audience data. |
| Platform-generated segment membership expiration | Any segment membership that is in the `Exited` state for more than 30 days, based on the `lastQualificationTime` field will be subject to deletion. |

{style="table-layout:auto"}

For more information on [!DNL Segmentation Service], please see the [Segmentation overview](../../segmentation/home.md).

## Sources {#sources}

Adobe Experience Platform can ingest data from external sources and allows you to structure, label, and enhance that data using Platform services. You can ingest data from a variety of sources such as Adobe applications, cloud-based storage, third-party software, and your CRM system.

Experience Platform provides a RESTful API and an interactive UI that lets you set up source connections for various data providers with ease. These source connections allow you to authenticate and connect to external storage systems and CRM services, set times for ingestion runs, and manage data ingestion throughput.

| Feature | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Allow user access to subfolders of cloud storage sources | You can now define access to a specific subfolder of your cloud storage source when creating a new account. Once created, users will only be able to access data from the permitted subfolder. This feature is available to the following cloud storage sources: [Azure Blob Storage](../../sources/connectors/cloud-storage/blob.md), [Google Cloud Storage](../../sources/connectors/cloud-storage/google-cloud-storage.md), [Google PubSub](../../sources/connectors/cloud-storage/google-pubsub.md), and [SFTP](../../sources/connectors/cloud-storage/sftp.md). |
| Beta availability of [!DNL SugarCRM] | [!DNL SugarCRM] sources are now available in beta. Use the [!DNL SugarCRM Accounts & Contacts] and the [!DNL SugarCRM Events] sources to bring data from your [!DNL SugarCRM] account to Experience Platform. For more information, read the [[!DNL SugarCRM] overview](../../sources/connectors/crm/sugarcrm.md). |
