# Adobe Experience Platform release notes 

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>In preparation for the generally availability of the Audience Portal feature, Adobe Experience Platform is updating the usage of "audiences" and "segment" within the system and the documentation.
>
>* **Audience**: A set of people, accounts, households, or other entities that share common characteristics and behaviors.
>
>* **Segment definition**: In Adobe Experience Platform, the rules used to describe key characteristics or behavior of a target audience.
This term was formerly known just as "segment".
>
>* **Segment**: The act of separating Profiles into audiences.
The term "segment" is now exclusively used as a verb.
>
>* **Segmentation**: The act of identifying and articulating the characteristics of the profiles that will be grouped together to produce a set of results, such as an audience.
>
>As a result, within the Adobe Experience Platform UI, you'll see "Segments" replaced with "Audiences" to reflect this new path of audience creation and management.

Updates to existing features in Adobe Experience Platform:

- [Data Collection](#data-collection)
- [Data Governance](#data-governance)
- [Data Ingestion](#data-ingestion)
- [Query Service](#query-service)
- [Sources](#sources)

## Data collection {#data-collection}

Adobe Experience Platform provides a suite of technologies that allow you to collect client-side customer experience data and send it to the Adobe Experience Platform Edge Network where it can be enriched, transformed, and distributed to Adobe or non-Adobe destinations.

**New or updated features**

| Feature | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [!DNL Twitter] conversions API extension | The [[!DNL Twitter] Conversions API](../../tags/extensions/server/twitter/overview.md) event forwarding extension allows you to forward event data server-side, in real-time, for event conversions using the [!DNL Twitter] Conversions API. |
| Data Element Path Assistance | Determining the path for your data element within the [Core extension](../../tags/extensions/client/core/overview.md) is now easier than ever. This enhancement delivers a guided form to help you select and format the correct data element path. |

To learn more about data collections, read the [data collections overview](../../tags/home.md).

## Data Governance {#data-governance}

Adobe Experience Platform Data Governance is a series of strategies and technologies used to manage customer data and ensure compliance with regulations, restrictions, and policies applicable to data usage. It plays a key role within Experience Platform at various levels, including cataloging, data lineage, data usage labeling, data access policies, and access control on data for marketing actions.

**New features**

| Feature | Description | 
| --- | --- |
| Dataset field level labelling deprecation | The ability to apply labels to individual fields has been moved from datasets to schemas. This allows you to centralize the management of field labels upstream for data governance, consent, and access control. Previously applied dataset field labels will be temporarily supported through the Experience Platform UI. Any existing dataset field labels need to be manually migrated to the schema field labels by you by May 31, 2024. Please read the [data governance end-to-end guide](../../data-governance/e2e.md) for more information on label migration. |

To learn more about data governance, read the [data governance overview](../../data-governance/home.md).

## Data Ingestion {#data-ingestion}

Adobe Experience Platform provides a rich set of features to ingest any type and any latency of data. You can ingest using Batch or Streaming APIs, using Adobe-built sources, data integration partners or the Adobe Experience Platform UI.

**Updated features**

| Feature | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Beta availability of data ingestion templates | Data ingestion templates provide data architects and engineers with standard templates and automation tools to accelerate the data ingestion process, including schema and dataset creation and mapping rules configuration. Data ingestion templates is currently available for the [[!DNL Marketo Engage]](../../sources/connectors/adobe-applications/marketo/marketo.md), [[!DNL Salesforce]](../../sources/connectors/crm/salesforce.md) and [[!DNL Microsoft Dynamics]](../../sources/connectors/crm/ms-dynamics.md) sources. For more information, read the guide on [using templates in the UI](../../sources/tutorials/ui/templates.md). |

To learn more about data ingestion, read the [Data Ingestion overview](../../ingestion/home.md).

## Query Service {#query-service}

Query Service allows you to use standard SQL to query data in Adobe Experience Platform [!DNL data lake]. You can join any datasets from data lake and capture the query results as a new dataset for use in reporting, Data Science Workspace, or for ingestion into Real-Time Customer Profile.

**Updated features**

| Feature | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Compute column level statistics on ADLS datasets | The `ANALYZE TABLE` command has been extended with the `COMPUTE STATISTICS` and `SHOW STATISTICS` SQL commands. You can now compute statistics for a subset of an ADLS dataset or for certain columns within that dataset. For more information, read the [dataset statistics computation guide](../../query-service/essential-concepts/dataset-statistics.md) |

{style="table-layout:auto"}

To learn more about Query Services, read the [Query Service overview](../../query-service/home.md).

## Sources {#sources}

Adobe Experience Platform can ingest data from external sources and allows you to structure, label, and enhance that data using Platform services. You can ingest data from a variety of sources ,such as Adobe applications, cloud-based storage, third-party software, and your CRM system.

Experience Platform provides a RESTful API and an interactive UI that lets you set up source connections for various data providers with ease. These source connections allow you to authenticate and connect to external storage systems and CRM services, set times for ingestion runs, and manage data ingestion throughput.

**Updated features**

| Feature | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Expanded API support for draft mode | You can now pause and save your progress during the sources workflow when using the [!DNL Flow Service] API at any time. Use the `mode=draft` state to save your base, source, and target connections as drafts. All draft entities can be revisited for completion at a later time. Read the guide on [setting your [!DNL Flow Service] entities to a draft state](../../sources/tutorials/api/draft.md) for more information. |
| General availability of the [!DNL Salesforce Marketing Cloud] source | The [[!DNL Salesforce Marketing Cloud source] is now in GA](../../sources/connectors/marketing-automation/salesforce-marketing-cloud.md). Use this source to bring your [!DNL Salesforce Marketing Cloud] data to Experience Platform. |
| [!DNL Google Ads] authentication updates | You can now provide a login customer ID when authenticating your [!DNL Google Ads] source account to fetch report data from a specific operating customer. Read the [[!DNL Google Ads] source documentation](../../sources/connectors/advertising/ads.md) for more information. |
| [!DNL Google PubSub] authentication updates | You can now define access privileges for your [!DNL Google PubSub] source when creating a new account. Use project-based authentication to allow root-level access, or use topic and subscription-based authentication to restrict access to a particular topic and subscription stream. Read the [[!DNL Google PubSub] source documentation](../../sources/connectors/cloud-storage/google-pubsub.md) for more information. |
| New pagination field parameters for `type=PAGE` in Self-Serve Sources (Batch SDK) | You can now use `initialPageIndex` and `endPageIndex` when integrating a source with `type=PAGE` through Batch SDK. <ul><li>`initialPageIndex`: This parameter allows you to define the page number from which the pagination starts. </li><li>`endPageIndex`: This parameter allows you to establish an end condition and stop pagination.</li></ul> For more information about these new parameters, read the [Self-Serve Sources Batch SDK documentation](../../sources/sources-sdk/config/sourcespec.md#page). |
| UI support for draft mode | You can now pause and save your progress during the sources workflow through the user interface. You can select **[!UICONTROL Save as draft]** during the dataflow detail, mapping, and scheduling steps of the workflow to save your dataflow as a draft for later completion. Read the guide on [saving dataflows as drafts in the UI](../../sources/tutorials/ui/draft.md) for more information. |
