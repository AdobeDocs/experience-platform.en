## Data Ingestion {#ingestion}

Adobe Experience Platform provides a rich set of features to ingest any type and any latency of data. You can ingest using Batch or Streaming APIs, using Adobe-built sources, data integration partners or the Adobe Experience Platform UI.

| Feature | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Beta availability of data ingestion templates | Data ingestion templates provides data architects and engineers standard templates and automation tools to accelerate the data ingestion process, including schema and dataset creation and mapping rules configuration. Data ingestion templates is currently available for the [[!DNL Marketo Engage]](../../sources/connectors/adobe-applications/marketo/marketo.md), [[!DNL Salesforce]](../../sources/connectors/crm/salesforce.md) and [[!DNL Microsoft Dynamics]](../../sources/connectors/crm/ms-dynamics.md) sources. For more information, read the guide on [using templates in the UI](../../sources/tutorials/ui/templates.md). |

For more information, read the [Data Ingestion overview](../../ingestion/home.md).

## Sources {#sources}

Adobe Experience Platform can ingest data from external sources and allows you to structure, label, and enhance that data using Platform services. You can ingest data from a variety of sources such as Adobe applications, cloud-based storage, third-party software, and your CRM system.

Experience Platform provides a RESTful API and an interactive UI that lets you set up source connections for various data providers with ease. These source connections allow you to authenticate and connect to external storage systems and CRM services, set times for ingestion runs, and manage data ingestion throughput.

**Updated features**

| Feature | Description |
| --- | --- |
| API support for streaming data from a Snowflake database | You can now stream data from a Snowflake source using the Flow Service API. |
| Expanded API support for draft mode | You can now pause and save your progress during the sources workflow when using the Flow Service API at any time. Use the `mode=draft` state to save your base, source, and target connections as drafts. All draft entities can be revisited for completion at a later time. Read the guide on [setting your [Flow Service] entities to a draft state](../../sources/tutorials/api/draft.md) for more information. |
| General availability of the Salesforce Marketing Cloud source | The [Salesforce Marketing Cloud source is now in GA](../../sources/connectors/marketing-automation/salesforce-marketing-cloud.md). Use this source to bring your Salesforce Marketing Cloud data to Experience Platform. |
| Google Ads authentication updates | You can now provide a login customer ID when authenticating your Google Ads source account to fetch report data from a specific operating customer. Read the [[!DNL Google Ads] source documentation](../../sources/connectors/advertising/ads.md) for more information. |
| Google PubSub authentication updates | You can now define access privileges for your Google PubSub source when creating a new account. Use project-based authentication to allow root-level access or use topic and subscription-based authentication to restrict access to a particular topic and subscription stream. Read the [[!DNL Google PubSub] source documentation](../../sources/connectors/cloud-storage/google-pubsub.md) for more information. |
| New pagination field parameters for `type=PAGE` in Self-Serve Sources (Batch SDK) | You can now use `initialPageIndex` and `endPageIndex` when integrating a source with `type=PAGE` through Batch SDK. <ul><li>`initialPageIndex`: This parameter allows you to define the page number from which the pagination starts from. </li><li>`endPageIndex`: This parameter allows you to establish an end condition and stop pagination.</li></ul> For more information about these new parameters, read the [Self-Serve Sources Batch SDK documentation](../../sources/sources-sdk/config/sourcespec.md#page). |
| UI support for draft mode | You can now pause and save your progress during the sources workflow through the user interface. You can select **[!UICONTROL Save as draft]** during the dataflow detail, mapping, and scheduling steps of the workflow to save your dataflow as a draft for later completion. Read the guide on [saving dataflows as drafts in the UI](../../sources/tutorials/ui/draft.md) for more information. |
