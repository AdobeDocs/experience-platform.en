# Adobe Experience Platform release notes 

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>In preparation for the generally availability of the Audience Portal feature, Adobe Experience Platform is updating the usage of "audiences" and "segment" within the system and the documentation.
>
>- **Audience**: A set of people, accounts, households, or other entities that share common characteristics and behaviors.
>
>- **Segment definition**: In Adobe Experience Platform, the rules used to describe key characteristics or behavior of a target audience. This term was formerly known just as "segment".
>
>- **Segment**: The act of separating Profiles into audiences. The term "segment" is now exclusively used as a verb.
>
>- **Segmentation**: The act of identifying and articulating the characteristics of the profiles that will be grouped together to produce a set of results, such as an audience.
>
>As a result, within the Adobe Experience Platform UI, you'll see "Segments" replaced with "Audiences" to reflect this new path of audience creation and management.

## Data collection {#data-collection}

Adobe Experience Platform provides a suite of technologies that allow you to collect client-side customer experience data and send it to the Adobe Experience Platform Edge Network where it can be enriched, transformed, and distributed to Adobe or non-Adobe destinations.

**New or updated features**

| Feature | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [!DNL Twitter] conversions API extension | The [[!DNL Twitter] Conversions API](../../tags/extensions/server/twitter/overview.md) event forwarding extension allows you to forward event data server-side, in real-time, for event conversions using the [!DNL Twitter] Conversions API. |
| Data Element Path Assistance | Determining the path for your data element within the [Core extension](../../tags/extensions/client/core/overview.md) is now easier than ever. This enhancement delivers a guided form to help you select and format the correct data element path. |

To learn more about data collections, read the [data collections overview](../../tags/home.md).

## Data Governance {#data-governance}

Adobe Experience Platform Data Governance is a series of strategies and technologies used to manage customer data and ensure compliance with regulations, restrictions, and policies applicable to data usage. It plays a key role within Experience Platform at various levels, including cataloging, data lineage, data usage labeling, data access policies, and access control on data for marketing actions.

**New features**

| Feature | Description | 
| --- | --- |
| Dataset field level labelling deprecation | The ability to apply labels to individual fields has been moved from datasets to schemas. This allows you to centralize the management of field labels upstream for data governance, consent, and access control. Previously applied dataset field labels will be temporarily supported through the Experience Platform UI. Any existing dataset field labels need to be manually migrated to the schema field labels by you by May 31, 2024. Please read the [data governance end-to-end guide](../../data-governance/e2e.md) for more information on label migration. |

{style="table-layout:auto"}

To learn more about data governance, read the [data governance overview](../../data-governance/home.md).

## Data Ingestion {#data-ingestion}

Adobe Experience Platform provides a rich set of features to ingest any type and any latency of data. You can ingest using Batch or Streaming APIs, using Adobe-built sources, data integration partners or the Adobe Experience Platform UI.

**Updated features**

| Feature | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Beta availability of data ingestion templates | Data ingestion templates provide data architects and engineers with standard templates and automation tools to accelerate the data ingestion process, including schema and dataset creation and mapping rules configuration. Data ingestion templates is currently available for the [[!DNL Marketo Engage]](../../sources/connectors/adobe-applications/marketo/marketo.md), [[!DNL Salesforce]](../../sources/connectors/crm/salesforce.md) and [[!DNL Microsoft Dynamics]](../../sources/connectors/crm/ms-dynamics.md) sources. For more information, read the guide on [using templates in the UI](../../sources/tutorials/ui/templates.md). |

To learn more about data ingestion, read the [data ingestion overview](../../ingestion/home.md).

## Destinations {#destinations}

[!DNL Destinations] are pre-built integrations with destination platforms that allow for the seamless activation of data from Adobe Experience Platform. You can use destinations to activate your known and unknown data for cross-channel marketing campaigns, email campaigns, targeted advertising, and many other use cases.

**New destinations** {#new-destinations}

| Destination | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |

**Fixes and enhancements** {#destinations-fixes-and-enhancements}

- We fixed a limitation in the (Beta) SFTP cloud storage destination, where users were not able to customize the value of the Port parameter. The value is now editable when setting up a (Beta) SFTP destination connection through the [API](/help/destinations/api/activate-segments-file-based-destinations.md) or [UI](/help/destinations/catalog/cloud-storage/sftp.md#authentication-information).

For more general information on destinations, refer to the [destinations overview](../../destinations/home.md).

## Experience Data Model (XDM) {#xdm}

XDM is an open-source specification that provides common structures and definitions (schemas) for data that is brought into Adobe Experience Platform. By adhering to XDM standards, all customer experience data can be incorporated into a common representation to deliver insights in a faster, more integrated way. You can gain valuable insights from customer actions, define customer audiences through segments, and use customer attributes for personalization purposes.

**Updated XDM components**

| Component type | Name | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Field Group | (Multiple) | Several fields for [Offer Item](https://github.com/adobe/xdm/pull/1720/files) were updated to remove a double hierarchy from the schema.  |

## Query Service {#query-service}

Query Service allows you to use standard SQL to query data in Adobe Experience Platform [!DNL data lake]. You can join any datasets from data lake and capture the query results as a new dataset for use in reporting, Data Science Workspace, or for ingestion into Real-Time Customer Profile.

**Updated features**

| Feature | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Compute column level statistics on ADLS datasets | The `ANALYZE TABLE` command has been extended with the `COMPUTE STATISTICS` and `SHOW STATISTICS` SQL commands.

## Sources {#sources}

Adobe Experience Platform can ingest data from external sources and allows you to structure, label, and enhance that data using Platform services. You can ingest data from a variety of sources ,such as Adobe applications, cloud-based storage, third-party software, and your CRM system.

Experience Platform provides a RESTful API and an interactive UI that lets you set up source connections for various data providers with ease. These source connections allow you to authenticate and connect to external storage systems and CRM services, set times for ingestion runs, and manage data ingestion throughput.
