# Adobe Experience Platform release notes 

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>In preparation for the generally availability of the Audience Portal feature, Adobe Experience Platform is updating the usage of "audiences" and "segment" within the system and the documentation.
>
>- **Audience**: A set of people, accounts, households, or other entities that share common characteristics and behaviors.
>
>- **Segment definition**: In Adobe Experience Platform, the rules used to describe key characteristics or behavior of a target audience. This term was formerly known just as "segment".
>
>- **Segment**: The act of separating Profiles into audiences. The term "segment" is now exclusively used as a verb.
>
>- **Segmentation**: The act of identifying and articulating the characteristics of the profiles that will be grouped together to produce a set of results, such as an audience.
>
>As a result, within the Adobe Experience Platform UI, you'll see "Segments" replaced with "Audiences" to reflect this new path of audience creation and management.

## Data Governance {#data-governance}

Adobe Experience Platform Data Governance is a series of strategies and technologies used to manage customer data and ensure compliance with regulations, restrictions, and policies applicable to data usage. It plays a key role within Experience Platform at various levels, including cataloging, data lineage, data usage labeling, data access policies, and access control on data for marketing actions.

**New features**

| Feature | Description | 
| --- | --- |
| Dataset field level labelling deprecation | The ability to apply labels to individual fields has been moved from datasets to schemas. This allows you to centralize the management of field labels upstream for data governance, consent, and access control. Previously applied dataset field labels will be temporarily supported through the Experience Platform UI. Any existing dataset field labels need to be manually migrated to the schema field labels by you by May 31, 2024. Please read the [data governance end-to-end guide](../../data-governance/e2e.md) for more information on label migration. |
