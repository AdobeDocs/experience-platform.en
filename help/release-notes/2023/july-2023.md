## Catalog Service {#catalog-service}

Catalog Service is the system of record for data location and lineage within Adobe Experience Platform. While all data that is ingested into Experience Platform is stored in the Data Lake as files and directories, Catalog holds the metadata and description of those files and directories for lookup and monitoring purposes.

| Feature | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Dataset inventory management | The datasets UI now offers a collections of inline actions to better manage your datasets. Advanced dataset management improves your work efficiency through the creation and assigning of folders and tags to your datasets that allows for filtering and improved discoverability. See the documentation for more information on [inline actions](../../catalog/datasets/user-guide.md#inline-actions), how to [search and filter datasets](../../catalog/datasets/user-guide.md#search-and-filter), and [move datasets to folders](../../catalog/datasets/user-guide.md#move-to-folders). |

## Data collection {#data-collection}

Adobe Experience Platform provides a suite of technologies that allow you to collect client-side customer experience data and send it to the Adobe Experience Platform Edge Network where it can be enriched, transformed, and distributed to Adobe or non-Adobe destinations.

**New or updated features**

| Type | Feature | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Tags and Event Forwarding | Data Collection Audit Logs | You can now see when an action was performed and who performed this action across Tags and Event Forwarding. This facilitates product troubleshooting, proper governance, and internal audit activities. This audit data is displayed via in-context slide out menus that also includes quick actions and resource status updates. This data is visible across the Tags and Event Forwarding UI in the following screens:<br><ul><li>[Property overview](../../tags/ui/event-forwarding/overview.md#properties)</li><li>[Rules](../../tags/ui/event-forwarding/overview.md#rules)</li><li>[Data Elements](../../tags/ui/event-forwarding/overview.md#data-elements)</li><li>[Extensions](../../tags/ui/event-forwarding/overview.md#extensions)</li><li>[Library review](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/platform-learn/data-collection/tags/build-and-publish-a-library.html)</li><li>[Library last build and published](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/platform-learn/data-collection/tags/build-and-publish-a-library.html)</li></ul> |
