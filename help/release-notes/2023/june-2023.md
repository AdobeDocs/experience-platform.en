# Adobe Experience Platform release notes 

**Release date: June 21, 2023**

Updates to existing features in Adobe Experience Platform:

- [Authentication to Experience Platform APIs](#authentication-platform-apis)
- [Data collection](#data-collection)
- [Destinations](#destinations)
- [Experience Data Model (XDM)](#xdm)
- [Query Service](#query-service)
- [Sources](#sources)

## Authentication to Experience Platform APIs {#authentication-platform-apis}

For Experience Platform API users, the method to obtain required access tokens to authenticate and make calls to API endpoints is now simplified. The JWT method to obtain access tokens is deprecated and replaced by a simpler OAuth Server-to-Server authentication method.<p>![New OAuth authentication method to get access tokens highlighted.](/help/landing/images/api-authentication/oauth-authentication-method.png "New OAuth authentication method to get access tokens highlighted."){width="100" zoomable="yes"}</p> 

While existing API integrations using the JWT authentication method will continue to work until January 1st, 2025, Adobe strongly recommends that you migrate existing integrations to the new OAuth Server-to-Server method before that date. Read the guide on [migrating from Service Account (JWT) credential to OAuth Server-to-Server credential](https://developer.adobe.com/developer-console/docs/guides/authentication/ServerToServerAuthentication/migration/).

Read the updated [Experience Platform authentication tutorial](/help/landing/api-authentication.md) for more information. 

## Data collection {#data-collection}

Adobe Experience Platform provides a suite of technologies that allow you to collect client-side customer experience data and send it to the Adobe Experience Platform Edge Network where it can be enriched, transformed, and distributed to Adobe or non-Adobe destinations.
