## Experience Data Model (XDM) {#xdm}

XDM is an open-source specification that provides common structures and definitions (schemas) for data that is brought into Adobe Experience Platform. By adhering to XDM standards, all customer experience data can be incorporated into a common representation to deliver insights in a faster, more integrated way. You can gain valuable insights from customer actions, define customer audiences through segments, and use customer attributes for personalization purposes.

**New features**

| Feature | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Experience Platform UI map datatype support | Further customize your Experience Data Model (XDM) data structure by defining map fields in the Platform UI. You can now create map fields in the Schema Editor to model flexible data structures or efficiently store key-value pairs. Select "Map" from the Type dropdown when defining a new field to configure subfields and assign them to field groups. Supported map value types are string and integer.<br>![The Schemas Editor with the Type and Map value type fields highlighted.](../2024/assets/march/maps.png "The Schemas Editor with the Type and Map value type fields highlighted."){width="100" zoomable="yes"}<br> To learn how to [define map fields in the UI](../../xdm/ui/fields/map.md), see the UI guide. |

These audiences are centrally configured and maintained on [!DNL Platform], and are readily accessible by any Adobe solution.
