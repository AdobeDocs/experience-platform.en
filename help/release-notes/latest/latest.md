## Agent Orchestrator {#agent-orchestrator}

Adobe Experience Platform Agent Orchestrator is the new agentic layer in Adobe Experience Platform.

**New features**

| Feature | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Agent Orchestrator | Adobe Experience Platform Agent Orchestrator is the new agentic layer in Adobe Experience Platform. Designed to leverage the platform's rich data and customer knowledge, Experience Platform Agent Orchestrator powers the intelligence and reasoning behind purpose-built expert Adobe Experience Platform Agents, enabling them to execute complex decision-making and problem-solving tasks at speed and scale â€” all with human oversight. When you ask questions or request help via natural language in a conversational interface like AI Assistant, Agent Orchestrator automatically calls upon specialized agents to get you the right answers. Agent Orchestrator remembers your conversation history, enabling you to build on previous questions naturally without repeating context, and combines insights from multiple agents to present you with clear, unified responses. For more information, read the [Agent Orchestrator documentation](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/experience-cloud-ai/experience-cloud-ai/agents/agent-orchestrator). |
| Audience Agent | The Audience Agent lets you view insights about audiences, including detecting significant audience size changes, detecting duplicate audiences, explore your audience inventory, and retrieve your audiences' size. For more information, read the [Audience Agent documentation](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/experience-cloud-ai/experience-cloud-ai/agents/audience). |

For more information, read the [Profile alerts](../../observability/alerts/rules.md#profile) guide. |

[!DNL Destinations] are pre-built integrations with destination platforms that allow for the seamless activation of data from Experience Platform. You can use destinations to activate your known and unknown data for cross-channel marketing campaigns, email campaigns, targeted advertising, and many other use cases.

**New or updated destinations**

| Destination | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [!BADGE Beta]{type=Informative} [[!DNL Snowflake Batch]](../../destinations/catalog/cloud-storage/snowflake-batch.md) connector | A new [!DNL Snowflake Batch] connector is now available, providing an alternative to the streaming connector for specific use cases. |
| [[!DNL Data Landing Zone]](../../destinations/catalog/cloud-storage/data-landing-zone.md) encryption support | You can now attach RSA-formatted public keys to encrypt your exported files, giving you the same level of security that other cloud storage destinations provide for your sensitive information. |
| Authentication expiration details for [[!DNL Pinterest]](../../destinations/catalog/advertising/pinterest.md) destinations | Authentication expiration information for [!DNL Pinterest] destinations is now visible directly in the Experience Platform interface, so you can see when your authentication will expire and renew it before it causes any disruptions to your dataflows. You can monitor your token expiration dates from the **[!UICONTROL Account expiration date]** column in either the **[[!UICONTROL Accounts]](../../destinations/ui/destinations-workspace.md#accounts)** or the **[[!UICONTROL Browse]](../../destinations/ui/destinations-workspace.md#browse)** tabs.|

**New or updated functionality**

| Feature | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Enhanced destination management capabilities in the Experience Platform UI | Improve your destination management workflow with new sorting capabilities across the [[!UICONTROL Browse]](../../destinations/ui/destinations-workspace.md#browse) and [[!UICONTROL Accounts]](../../destinations/ui/destinations-workspace.md#accounts) tabs. You can now also see a visual indicator when your account authentication is about to expire. <br> ![](../../destinations/assets/ui/workspace/expired-accounts.png){width="100" zoomable="yes"} |
| Persistent column width settings | Column width settings now persist when navigating away from a page and returning to it. For example, if you adjust a column width in the [[!UICONTROL Browse]](../../destinations/ui/destinations-workspace.md#browse) tab, your custom column width will remain the same when you navigate away and return to that tab. |

For more information, read the [Destinations overview](../../destinations/home.md).

## Experience Data Model (XDM) {#xdm}

XDM is an open-source specification that provides common structures and definitions (schemas) for data that is brought into Experience Platform. By adhering to XDM standards, all customer experience data can be incorporated into a common representation to deliver insights in a faster, more integrated way. You can gain valuable insights from customer actions, define customer audiences through segments, and use customer attributes for personalization purposes.

**New features**

| Feature | Description |
| ------- | ----------- |
| Model-based schemas | Simplify your data modeling with Model-Based Schemas. You can now create schemas more easily with comprehensive how-to examples and guidance. This feature is currently available to Campaign Orchestration license holders and will expand to Data Distiller customers at GA, making data modeling more accessible and efficient. The feature includes support for time-series data and change data capture capabilities. |
| Data Mirror | Ingest row-level changes from cloud data warehouses (e.g., Snowflake, Databricks, BigQuery) into Adobe Experience Platform using model-based schemas. Data Mirror eliminates upstream ETL and preserves relationships, versioning, and deletions by mirroring existing database structures directly into the data lake. Time-series and record event schema behavior with change data capture capabilities are all supported. This feature is currently available for Campaign Orchestration license holders and will expand through this limited release, also including Customer Journey Analytics customers. See the [Data Mirror documentation](../../xdm/data-mirror/overview.md) for more details. Contact your Adobe representative for access. |

## Segmentation Service {#segmentation-service}

[!DNL Segmentation Service] defines a particular subset of profiles by describing the criteria that distinguishes a marketable group of people within your customer base.
