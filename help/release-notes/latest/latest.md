## Dashboards {#dashboards}

Experience Platform provides multiple dashboards through which you can view important insights about your organization's data, as captured during daily snapshots.

**New or updated features**

| Feature | Description |
| ------- | ----------- |
| Metrics-based license usage dashboard | The license usage dashboard now includes a streamlined UI with two tabs: **Metrics** and **Products**. The new **Metrics** tab offers a consolidated view of all trackable license metrics across your purchased products. Each metric includes an inline info icon displaying descriptions and associated products. Users can select Production or Development sandboxes, view historical usage trends in interactive charts, and export sandbox-specific data as CSV files. These updates streamline license tracking and provide clearer insights. Learn more in the [license usage dashboard guide](../../dashboards/guides/license-usage.md) for more details. |
| Updated prediction frequency | The license usage dashboard now provides more accurate insights into projected consumption by updating usage predictions **weekly** instead of monthly. These forecasts show estimated usage over the next six weeks based on recent trends. This change allows for faster decision-making, earlier intervention, and improved license planning. See the [license usage dashboard guide](../../dashboards/guides/license-usage.md#predicted-usage) for details. |
| Updated metric descriptions in UI | Metric definitions in the license usage dashboard have been revised for clarity and consistency. You can now view updated descriptions directly in the dashboard using inline info icons next to each metric in the **Metrics** tab. These updates make it easier to understand how metrics are tracked and which products they apply to. See the [license usage dashboard guide](../../dashboards/guides/license-usage.md#available-metrics) for more details. |

## Destinations {#destinations}

[!DNL Destinations] are pre-built integrations with destination platforms that allow for the seamless activation of data from Adobe Experience Platform. You can use destinations to activate your known and unknown data for cross-channel marketing campaigns, email campaigns, targeted advertising, and many other use cases.

**New or updated destinations** {#new-updated-destinations}

| Destination | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [Demandbase People connection](/help/destinations/catalog/advertising/demandbase-people.md) | Use the [!DNL Demandbase People] connection to activate profiles for your Demandbase campaigns for audience targeting, personalization, and suppression. |
| [Bombora account connection](/help/destinations/catalog/advertising/bombora.md) | Use the  [!DNL Bombora] connection to activate profiles for your Bombora campaigns for audience targeting, personalization, and suppression, based on [account audiences](/help/segmentation/types/account-audiences.md). |
| [Airship Attributes](/help/destinations/catalog/mobile-engagement/airship-attributes.md) upgrade | Starting March 25, 2025, you can see two **[!UICONTROL Airship Attributes]** cards side-by-side in the destinations catalog. This is due to an internal upgrade to the destinations service. The existing **[!UICONTROL Airship Attributes]** destination connector has been renamed to **[!UICONTROL (Deprecated) Airship Attributes]** and a new card with the name **[!UICONTROL Airship Attributes]** is now available to you. <br> Use the **[!UICONTROL Airship Attributes]** connection in the catalog for new activation data flows. If you have any active dataflows to the [!DNL (Deprecated) Airship Attributes] destination, they will be updated automatically, so no action is required from you. <br> If you are creating dataflows through the [Flow Service API](https://developer.adobe.com/experience-platform-apis/references/destinations/), you must update your [!DNL flow spec ID] and [!DNL connection spec ID] to the following values: <ul><li> Flow spec ID: `a862e0be-966e-4e5a-80d3-1bb566461986`</li><li> Connection spec ID: `594bc002-4a47-49b7-8a98-ac0d21045502`</li> </ul>|

**New or updated functionality** {#destinations-new-updated-functionality}

| Feature | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [Reporting accuracy enhancements for streaming destinations](../../dataflows/ui/monitor-destinations.md) | Starting with March 2025, Adobe is rolling out an update to increase reporting accuracy for streaming destinations. This enhancement ensures a better alignment between the reporting in Experience Platform and the destination platforms. <br> Before this update, **[!UICONTROL Identities failed]** included all activation retries. After this update, only the last activation retry is included in the total count. <br> This enhancement applies to all streaming destinations. <br> Following this enhancement, users of streaming destinations may see an expected drop in their **[!UICONTROL Identities failed]** count. |
