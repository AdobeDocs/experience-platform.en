# Zeta Marketing Platform {#zeta-marketing-platform}

## Overview {#overview}

The Zeta Marketing Platform, henceforth ZMP, is a cloud-based system with the tools to help you acquire, grow, and retain customers more efficiently, powered by intelligence (proprietary data and AI). For more details, refer to [Zeta Global](https://zetaglobal.com/). 

With the ZMP connector available in Adobe Experience Platform, you can seamlessly synchronize your audiences from Experience Platform to the ZMP. 
>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>The destination connector and documentation page are created and maintained by the *Zeta Global* team. For any inquiries or update requests, please contact the team at [Contact Us](https://zetaglobal.com/about/contact-us/).

## Use cases {#use-cases}

### Use case #1 {#use-case-1}
A marketer wants to build unique audience profiles, identify their most valuable segments, and use them across any digital channel that the ZMP supports. They want to create a true 360 view of a consumer profile, build and activate meaningful audiences. More details on which channels the ZMP supports can be found [here](https://zetaglobal.com/platform/integrations/).

### Use case #2 {#use-case-2}
An advertiser wants to target users in audiences with ads through the Zeta DSP as the user interacts with their brands. More information on the Zeta DSP and other DSPs that the ZMP supports can be found [here](https://knowledgebase.zetaglobal.com/programmatic-user-guide/).

## Prerequisites {#prerequisites}

### Zeta Marketing Platform prerequisites

* Prior to setting up a new destination, please ensure the presence of a pre-existing shell customer list in your ZMP account. You will then be required to choose one of these customer lists as the designated target to receive the Adobe Experience Platform audience that you plan to send. You can create an empty customer list by following the instructions [here](https://knowledgebase.zetaglobal.com/zmp/creating-audiences#CreatingAudiences-CreatingaCustomerList).
* The username and password to configure the destination will be **api** and the **REST API Key** that you can view in your ZMP account by navigating to **Settings** > **Integrations** > **Keys & Apps** section. More information can be found [here](https://knowledgebase.zetaglobal.com/zmp/integrations).
* Note that even though the Adobe Experience Platform supports activating multiple audience to a specific ZMP destination instance, each ZMP destination instance should only receive one and only one Experience Platform audience.

## Supported identities {#supported-identities}

The ZMP destination connector will allow you to map any platform identities to the identities that are set in your ZMP account. The connector automagically fills out the target fields that you can choose during the mapping step.

[!DNL Zeta Marketing Platform] supports the activation of custom user IDs described in the table below. For more details, see [identities](/help/identity-service/namespaces.md).

|Target Identity|Description|Notes|
---------|----------|----------|
|Email|Email address|Select email when you want to identify a unique profile using their email address.|
|Email MD5|MD5-hashed email address|Select emailmd5 when you want to identify a unique profile using their Md5-hased email address.|

## Supported audiences {#supported-audiences}

This section describes which type of audiences you can export to this destination.

| Audience origin | Supported | Description | 
---------|----------|----------|
| [!DNL Segmentation Service] | âœ“ | Audiences generated through the Experience Platform [Segmentation Service](../../../segmentation/home.md).|

## Export type and frequency {#export-type-frequency}

Refer to the table below for information about the destination export type and frequency.

| Item | Type | Notes |
---------|----------|---------|
| Export frequency | **[!UICONTROL Streaming]** | Streaming destinations are "always on" API-based connections. As soon as a profile is updated in Experience Platform based on segment evaluation, the connector sends the update downstream to the destination platform. Read more about [streaming destinations](/help/destinations/destination-types.md#streaming-destinations).|

## Exported data / Validate data export {#exported-data}

A successful audience syndication from experience platfrom to the ZMP will update the target customer list in the ZMP. The count as well as sample profiles in the target customer list will be exactly equal to the number of identities that were successfuly activated from experience platform.

Each audience member that was syndicated from the experience platform will also be visible under **Audiences** > **People** in the ZMP. 

![Customer List in ZMP](../../assets/catalog/data-management-platform/zmp-extension/CustomerListInZMP.png)

You will also be able to view the **Customer List** segment a profile belongs to in the Single Customer view as shown below.
