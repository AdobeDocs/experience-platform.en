## Use case {#use-case}

Use this destination to activate your account audiences for Account-Based Marketing (ABM) use cases.

For instance, leverage Demandbase's ad-tech DSP to target specific personas or roles within key accounts for top-of-funnel lead generation, or create and grow buying groups. Use the Demandbase destination to explore other use cases to target your accounts effectively.

With this integration, you can also personalize the website experience using real-time account information lookup to optimize engagement.

These mappings are required for the destination to function properly and must be configured before you can proceed with the activation workflow.

## Additional notes and important callouts {#additional-notes}

* If an account audience with the same name was activated earlier to Demandbase, you cannot activate it again through a different dataflow to the Demandbase destination.
* If you have exported audiences to Demandbase and the exports are successful in Experience Platform, yet not all of the data reaches Demandbase, you might have encountered API throttling on the Demandbase side. Reach out to them for clarification.
