# Demandbase People connection {#demandbase-people}

Activate profiles for your Demandbase campaigns for audience targeting, personalization, and suppression.

## Use case {#use-case}

As a marketer, after running an [account-based campaign](../../ui/activate-account-audiences.md), I can analyze engagement data to identify key individuals for retargeting. I can create a People List of engaged contacts, decision-makers, and high-value personas, then launch a nurture campaign through email, paid media, or personalized content to deepen engagement.

Additionally, I can segment individuals by job title, industry, or engagement level to create targeted campaigns with personalized messaging, driving higher engagement and conversions.

## Supported audiences {#supported-audiences}

## Additional notes and important callouts {#additional-notes}

* **Demandbase API guardrails**: Work with your Demandbase contact to understand your API guardrails. The Import API allows for a maximum number of 1200 API calls per time period (86400 seconds).
* **List deletion**: People lists are unique, so you cannot re-create a new list with a name already in use. When you remove people from a list, they will no longer be available, but they will not be deleted.
* **Activation time**: Data loading in Demandbase is subject to overnight processing. The cut-off time is 4PM PST. You should see your data in Demandbase by 8AM PST.
* **Audience naming**: If an audience with the same name was activated earlier in Demandbase, yo will receive an error if you try to activate the same audience on the same or on another activation dataflow.
