# Advertising destinations {#advertising-destinations}

Connect your [!DNL Real-time Customer Data Platform] to a 3rd-party advertising platform (e.g. DSP, ad network, SSP) and share pseudonymous audiences to these platforms.

When connecting to an advertising destination, your audiences are sent as IDs to the destination platform, where they are mapped to an ID known by the destination platform.

Currently, Real-time CDP supports the advertising destinations listed below. For information on how to connect to these destinations, see the individual links:
