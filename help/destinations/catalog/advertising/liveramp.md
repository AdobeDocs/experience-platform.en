# (Alpha) [!DNL LiveRamp - SFTP] connection {#liveramp-destination}

Use the LiveRamp connection to onboard audiences from Adobe Real-Time Customer Data Platform to [!DNL LiveRamp Connect].

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
><p>This destination connection is currently in alpha stage and only available to a limited selection of customers. The functionality and documentation are subject to change.</p>
><p>The final version of this destination connection may require customer migration.</p>

## Use cases {#use-cases}

To help you better understand how and when you should use the [!DNL LiveRamp SFTP] destination, here is a sample use case that Adobe Experience Platform customers can solve by using this destination.

As a marketer, I want to send audiences from Adobe Experience Platform to onboard identities into [!DNL LiveRamp Connect] so that I can target users on [!DNL CTV] platforms, using the [!DNL Ramp ID] identifier. 

## Prerequisites {#prerequisites}

The [!DNL LiveRamp - SFTP] connection exports files using [LiveRamp's SFTP](https://docs.liveramp.com/connect/en/upload-a-file-via-liveramp-s-sftp.html) storage.

Before you can send data from Experience Platform to [!DNL LiveRamp SFTP], you need your [!DNL LiveRamp] credentials. Please reach out to your [!DNL LiveRamp] representative to obtain your credentials, if you don't already have them.

## Supported identities {#supported-identities}

LiveRamp SFTP supports the activation of identities such as PII-based identifiers, known identifiers, and custom IDs, described in the official [LiveRamp documentation](https://docs.liveramp.com/connect/en/identity-and-identifier-terms-and-concepts.html#known-identifiers).

In the [mapping step](#map) of the activation workflow, you must define the target mappings as custom attributes.

## Export type and frequency {#export-type-frequency}

Refer to the table below for information about the destination export type and frequency.

| Item | Type | Notes |
---------|----------|---------|
| Export type | **[!UICONTROL Audience export]** | You are exporting all members of an audience with the identifiers (name, phone number, or others) used in the [!DNL LiveRamp SFTP] destination.|
| Export frequency | **[!UICONTROL Daily batch]** | As profiles are updated in Experience Platform based on audience evaluation, the profiles (identities) are updated once a day downstream to the destination platform. Read more about [batch file-based destinations](/help/destinations/destination-types.md#file-based).|

### Enable alerts {#enable-alerts}

You can enable alerts to receive notifications on the status of the dataflow to your destination. Select an alert from the list to subscribe to receive notifications on the status of your dataflow. For more information on alerts, read the guide on [subscribing to destinations alerts using the UI](../../ui/alerts.md).

When you are finished providing details for your destination connection, select **[!UICONTROL Next]**.

## Activate audiences to this destination {#activate}

>[!IMPORTANT]
> 
>To activate data, you need the **[!UICONTROL Manage Destinations]**, **[!UICONTROL Activate Destinations]**, **[!UICONTROL View Profiles]**, and **[!UICONTROL View Segments]** [access control permissions](/help/access-control/home.md#permissions). Read the [access control overview](/help/access-control/ui/overview.md) or contact your product administrator to obtain the required permissions.

Read [Activate audience data to batch profile export destinations](/help/destinations/ui/activate-batch-profile-destinations.md) for instructions on activating audiences to this destination.

### Scheduling {#scheduling}

In the [!UICONTROL Scheduling] step, create an export schedule for each audience, with the settings shown below.

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>All audiences activated to this destination must be configured with the exact same schedule, as shown below.

* **[!UICONTROL File export options]**: [!UICONTROL Export full files]. [Incremental file exports](../../ui/activate-batch-profile-destinations.md#export-incremental-files) are currently not supported for the [!DNL LiveRamp] destination.
* **[!UICONTROL Frequency]**: [!UICONTROL Daily]
* Set the export time to **[!UICONTROL After segment evaluation]**. Scheduled audience exports and [on-demand file exports](../../ui/export-file-now.md) are currently not supported for the [!DNL LiveRamp] destination.
* **[!UICONTROL Date]**: Select the export start and end times as you wish.

![Platform UI screenshot showing the audience scheduling step.](../../assets/catalog/advertising/liveramp/liveramp-segment-scheduling.png)

The exported file name is currently not user-configurable. All files exported to the [!DNL LiveRamp SFTP] destination are automatically named based on the following template:

`%ORGANIZATION_NAME%_%DESTINATION%_%DESTINATION_INSTANCE_ID%_%DATETIME%`

![Platform UI screenshot showing the exported file name template.](../../assets/catalog/advertising/liveramp/liveramp-file-name.png)

For example, the name of an exported file for an organization named [!DNL Luma] could look similar to this:

```json
Luma_LiveRamp_52137231-4a99-442d-804c-39a09ddd005d_20230330_153857.csv
```

### Map attributes and identities {#map}

In the **[!UICONTROL Mapping]** step, you can select which attributes and identities you want to export for your profiles.

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>This destination supports the activation of one source identity namespace per activation flow. If you need to export multiple identity namespaces, like `Email` and `Phone`, you must [create a separate activation flow](../../ui/activate-batch-profile-destinations.md) for each identity.

In the **[!UICONTROL Mapping]** step, the **[!UICONTROL Target field]** mapping defines the name of the column header in the exported CSV file. You can change the CSV column headers in the exported file to any friendly name that you want, by providing a custom name for the **[!UICONTROL Target field]**.

1. In the **[!UICONTROL Mapping]** step, select **[!UICONTROL Add new mapping]**. You will see a new mapping row on the screen.

    ![Experience Platform UI screeshot showing the Mapping screen.](../../assets/catalog/advertising/liveramp/liveramp-add-new-mapping.png)

2. In the **[!UICONTROL Select source field]** window, choose the **[!UICONTROL Select attributes]** category and select the XDM attribute that you want to map, or choose the **[!UICONTROL Select identity namespace]** category and select an identity to map to your destination.
    
    ![Experience Platform UI screeshot showing the source Mapping screen.](../../assets/catalog/advertising/liveramp/liveramp-source-mapping.png)

3. In the **[!UICONTROL Select target field]** window, enter the attribute name that you want to map the selected source field to. The attribute name defined here will reflect in the exported CSV file as a column header.

    ![Experience Platform UI screeshot showing the target Mapping screen.](../../assets/catalog/advertising/liveramp/liveramp-target-mapping.png)
    
    You can also input the attribute name by typing it directly into the **[!UICONTROL Target field]**.
    
    ![Experience Platform UI screeshot showing the target Mapping screen.](../../assets/catalog/advertising/liveramp/liveramp-target-field.png)

Once you've added all your desired mappings, select **[!UICONTROL Next]** and finish the activation workflow.

## Exported data / Validate data export {#exported-data}

Your data is exported to the [!DNL LiveRamp SFTP] storage location that you configured, as CSV files.

When exporting files to the [!DNL LiveRamp SFTP] destination, Platform generates one CSV file for each [merge policy ID](../../../profile/merge-policies/overview.md).

For example, let's consider the following audiences:

* Audience A (Merge policy 1)
* Audience B (Merge policy 2)
* Audience C (Merge policy 1)
* Audience D (Merge policy 1)

Platform will export two CSV files to [!DNL LiveRamp SFTP]:

* One CSV file containing audiences A, C, and D;
* One CSV file containing audience B.

Exported CSV files contain profiles with the selected attributes and the corresponding audience status, on separate columns, with the attribute name and audience IDs as a column headers.

The profiles included in the exported files can match one the following audience qualification statuses:

* `Active`: The profile is currently qualified for the audience.
* `Expired`: The profile is no longer qualified for the audience, but has qualified in the past.
* `""`(empty string): The profile never qualfied for the audience.


For instance, an exported CSV file with one `email` attribute and 3 audiences could look like this:

```csv
email,aa2e3d98-974b-4f8b-9507-59f65b6442df,45d4e762-6e57-4f2f-a3e0-2d1893bcdd7f,7729e537-4e42-418e-be3b-dce5e47aaa1e
abc117@testemailabc.com,active,,
abc111@testemailabc.com,,,active
abc102@testemailabc.com,,,active
abc116@testemailabc.com,active,,
abc107@testemailabc.com,active,expired,active
abc101@testemailabc.com,active,active,
```

Since Platform generates one CSV file for each [merge policy ID](../../../profile/merge-policies/overview.md), it also generates a separate dataflow run for each merge policy ID.

This means that the **[!UICONTROL Identities activated]** and **[!UICONTROL Profiles received]** metrics in the [dataflow runs](../../../dataflows/ui/monitor-destinations.md#dataflow-runs-for-batch-destinations) page are aggregated for each group of audiences that use the same merge policy, instead of being displayed for each audience.

As a consequence of dataflow runs being generated for a group of audiences that use the same merge policy, the audience names are not displayed in the [monitoring dashboard](../../../dataflows/ui/monitor-destinations.md#dataflow-runs-for-batch-destinations).

![Experience Platform UI screeshot showing the identities activated metric.](../../assets/catalog/advertising/liveramp/liveramp-metrics.png)

## Upload exported data to LiveRamp {#upload-to-liveramp}

After your data was successfully exported to the [!DNL LiveRamp - SFTP] storage, you must upload the data to the [!DNL LiveRamp] platform.
