## Prerequisites {#prerequisites}

## Activate audiences to this destination {#activate}

>[!IMPORTANT]
> 
>* To activate data, you need the **[!UICONTROL View Destinations]**, **[!UICONTROL Activate Destinations]**, **[!UICONTROL View Profiles]**, and **[!UICONTROL View Segments]** [access control permissions](/help/access-control/home.md#permissions). Read the [access control overview](/help/access-control/ui/overview.md) or contact your product administrator to obtain the required permissions.
>* To export *identities*, you need the **[!UICONTROL View Identity Graph]** [access control permission](/help/access-control/home.md#permissions). <br> ![Select identity namespace highlighted in the workflow to activate audiences to destinations.](/help/destinations/assets/overview/export-identities-to-destination.png "Select identity namespace highlighted in the workflow to activate audiences to destinations."){width="100" zoomable="yes"}

See [Activate audience data to streaming audience export destinations](../../ui/activate-segment-streaming-destinations.md) for instructions on activating audiences to this destination.

In the [Audience schedule](../../ui/activate-segment-streaming-destinations.md#scheduling) step, you must manually map your audiences to their corresponding ID or friendly name in the destination platform.

When mapping segments, we recommend you use the Platform audience name or a shorter form of it, for ease of use. However, the audience ID or name in your destination does not need to match the one in your Platform account. Any value you insert in the mapping field will be reflected by the destination.

If you are using multiple device mappings (cookie IDs, [!DNL IDFA], [!DNL GAID]), make sure to use the same mapping value for all three mappings. [!DNL The Trade Desk] will aggregate all of them into a single segment, with a device-level breakdown.

## Exported data {#exported-data}

To verify if data has been exported successfully to [!DNL The Trade Desk] destination, check your [!DNL Trade Desk] account. If activation was successful, audiences are populated in your account.
