# Adform connection {#adform}

## Overview {#overview}

Adform is a leading provider of programmatic media buying and selling solutions. By connecting Adform to the Adobe Experience Platform, you can activate your first party audiences through Adform based on the Experience Cloud ID (ECID).

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>The destination connector and documentation page are created and maintained by the Adform team. For any inquiries or update requests, please contact them directly at `support@adform.com`.

## Use cases {#use-cases}

To help you better understand how and when you should use the Adform destination, here are sample use cases that Adobe Experience Platform customers can solve by using this destination.

### Adobe Real-Time CDP audience activation {#use-case-1}

Use this destination to send Adobe Real-Time CDP audiences to Adform for activation based on the Experience Cloud ID (ECID) and Adform's ID Fusion. Adform's ID Fusion is Adform's ID resolution service that allows you to activate your first party audiences based on the Experience Cloud ID (ECID).

A common case is re-targeting of your website visitors to your website or app based on the Experience Cloud ID (ECID). All you need to do is to send the Experience Cloud ID (ECID) to Adform via the readily available [Event Streaming](https://exchange.adobe.com/apps/ec/600102/adform-s2s-site-tracking) or [client-side](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/experience-platform/destinations/catalog/analytics/adform) Adform extensions. After that you can share audiences with Adform via the Adform destination for activation - solely based on the Experience Cloud ID (ECID).

## Prerequisites {#prerequisites}

* You need to be an existing Adform customer to use this destination.
* You need to have your Adform Audience Base Data Connection credentials.
    * If you don't have Adform Audience Base Data Connection credentials, please contact your Adform representative.

    * If you don't have an Event Streaming or client-side connection from your entities to Adform Site Tracking, please contact your Adform representative.
