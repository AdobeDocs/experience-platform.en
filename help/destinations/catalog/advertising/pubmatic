## Use cases {#use-cases}

To help you better understand how and when you should use the PubMatic Connect destination, here are sample use cases that Adobe Experience Platform customers can solve by using this destination.

### Use case #1 {#use-case-1}

Publisher or data providers want to send audiences from Adobe Experience Platform to onboard identities into PubMatic Connect in order to target users on mobile, web and CTV platforms, using a large range of identifiers.

## Prerequisites {#prerequisites}

_Add information in this section about anything that customers need to be aware of before starting to set up the destination in the Adobe Experience Platform user interface. This can be about:_

- _needing to be added to an allow list_
- _requirements for email hashing_
- _any account specifics on your side_
- _how to obtain an API key to connect to your platform_

_You can link out to your relevant documentation if that would be useful to customers._

## Supported identities {#supported-identities}

PubMatic Connect supports the activation of identities described in the table below. Learn more about [identities](/help/identity-service/namespaces.md).

For more information on alerts, see the guide on [subscribing to destinations alerts using the UI](../../ui/alerts.md).

When you are finished providing details for your destination connection, select **[!UICONTROL Next]**.

## Activate segments to this destination {#activate}

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> - To activate data, you need the **[!UICONTROL Manage Destinations]**, **[!UICONTROL Activate Destinations]**, **[!UICONTROL View Profiles]**, and **[!UICONTROL View Segments]** [access control permissions](/help/access-control/home.md#permissions). Read the [access control overview](/help/access-control/ui/overview.md) or contact your product administrator to obtain the required permissions.
> - To export _identities_, you need the **[!UICONTROL View Identity Graph]** [access control permission](/help/access-control/home.md#permissions). <br> ![Select identity namespace highlighted in the workflow to activate audiences to destinations.](/help/destinations/assets/overview/export-identities-to-destination.png "Select identity namespace highlighted in the workflow to activate audiences to destinations."){width="100" zoomable="yes"}

_Delete as appropriate - If you are documenting a new streaming destination, keep the first paragraph below. If you are documenting a new file-based destination, keep the second paragraph. If you are documenting a destination that exports datasets, keep the third paragraph._

Read [Activate profiles and segments to streaming segment export destinations](/help/destinations/ui/activate-segment-streaming-destinations.md) for instructions on activating audience segments to this destination.

Read [Activate audience data to batch profile export destinations](/help/destinations/ui/activate-batch-profile-destinations.md) for instructions on activating audience segments to this destination.

Read [(Beta) Export datasets](/help/destinations/ui/export-datasets.md) for extensive instructions on exporting datasets to this destination.

### Map attributes and identities {#map}

_Add information about supported mappings between source and target fields in the Mapping step of the activation workflow. Your destination might support exporting profile attributes, identity namespaces, or both. Some fields might be mandatory. Target attributes might be predefined or custom. Call out the important caveats and use examples, preferably with screenshots. Two examples of destination pages which you can use as reference are:_

- _[Pega](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-platform/destinations/catalog/personalization/pega.html?lang=en#mapping-example)_
- _[Medallia](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-platform/destinations/catalog/voice/medallia-connector.html?lang=en#map)_

## Exported data / Validate data export {#exported-data}

_Add a paragraph about how data is exported to your destination. This would help the customer make sure that they have correctly integrated with your destination. For example, you could provide a sample JSON like the one below. Or, you could provide screenshots and information from your destination's interface that show how customers should expect segments to be populating in the destination platform._
