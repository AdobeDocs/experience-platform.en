# Pega Customer Decision Hub connection



## Overview {#overview}

Send profile segment membership data to Pega Customer Descision Hub (Pega CDH) for Next Best Action (NBA) decisioning. 

Adobe Experience Platform Profile Segment membership feed into Pega can be used as predictors in Pega CDH’s adaptive models and help deliver the right contextual and behavioral data for NBA decisioning purposes.

## Use cases 

To help you better understand how and when you should use the Pega CDH destination, here are sample use cases that Adobe Experience Platform customers can solve by using this destination.

### Use case #1

*For mobile messaging platforms:*

*A home rental and sales platform wants to push mobile notifications to customers' Android and iOS devices to let them know that there are 100 updated listings in the area where they previously searched for a rental.*

### Use case #2

*For social network platforms:*

*An athletic apparel brand wants to reach existing customers through their social media accounts. The apparel brand can ingest email addresses from their own CRM to Adobe Experience Platform, build segments from their own offline data, and send these segments to YOURDESTINATION, to display ads in their customers' social media feeds.*

## Prerequisites {#prerequisites}

*Add information in this section about anything that customers need to be aware of before starting to set up the destination in the Adobe Experience Platform user interface. This can be about:*

* *needing to be added to an allow list*
* *requirements for email hashing*
* *any account specifics on your side*
* *how to obtain an API key to connect to your platform*

*You can link out to your relevant documentation if that would be useful to customers.*

## Supported identities {#supported-identities}

*Add information in this section about the identities supported by your destination. We have prefilled the table with some standard values. Delete the values that don't apply to your destination and any values that are not prefilled.*

*YOURDESTINATION* supports the activation of identities described in the table below. Learn more about [identities](/help/identity-service/namespaces.md).

|Target Identity|Description|Considerations|
|---|---|---|
|GAID|Google Advertising ID|Select the GAID target identity when your source identity is a GAID namespace.|
|IDFA|Apple ID for Advertisers|Select the IDFA target identity when your source identity is an IDFA namespace.|
|ECID|Experience Cloud ID|A namespace that represents ECID. This namespace can also be referred to by the following aliases: “Adobe Marketing Cloud ID”, “Adobe Experience Cloud ID”, “Adobe Experience Platform ID”. See the following document on [ECID](/help/identity-service/ecid.md) for more information.|
|phone_sha256|Phone numbers hashed with the SHA256 algorithm|Both plain text and SHA256 hashed phone numbers are supported by Adobe Experience Platform. When your source field contains unhashed attributes, check the **[!UICONTROL Apply transformation]** option, to have [!DNL Platform] automatically hash the data on activation.|
|email_lc_sha256|Email addresses hashed with the SHA256 algorithm|Both plain text and SHA256 hashed email addresses are supported by Adobe Experience Platform. When your source field contains unhashed attributes, check the **[!UICONTROL Apply transformation]** option, to have [!DNL Platform] automatically hash the data on activation.|
|extern_id|Custom user IDs|Select this target identity when your source identity is a custom namespace.|

## Export type and frequency {#export-type-frequency}

*In the table, keep only the lines that correspond to your destination. You should have one line for Export type and one line for Export frequency. Delete the values that don't apply to your destination.*

Refer to the table below for information about the destination export type and frequency.

| Item | Type | Notes |
---------|----------|---------|
| Export type | **[!UICONTROL Segment export]** | You are exporting all members of a segment (audience) with the identifiers (name, phone number, or others) used in the *YOURDESTINATION* destination.|
| Export type | **[!UICONTROL Profile-based]** | You are exporting all members of a segment, together with the desired schema fields (for example: email address, phone number, last name), as chosen in the select profile attributes screen of the [destination activation workflow](/help/destinations/ui/activate-batch-profile-destinations.md#select-attributes).|
| Export frequency | **[!UICONTROL Streaming]** | Streaming destinations are "always on" API-based connections. As soon as a profile is updated in Experience Platform based on segment evaluation, the connector sends the update downstream to the destination platform. Read more about [streaming destinations](/help/destinations/destination-types.md#streaming-destinations).|
| Export frequency | **[!UICONTROL Batch]** | Batch destinations export files to downstream platforms in increments of three, six, eight, twelve, or twenty-four hours. Read more about [batch file-based destinations](/help/destinations/destination-types.md#file-based).|
