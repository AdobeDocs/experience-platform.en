# Pega Customer Decision Hub connection

## Overview {#overview}

Use the Pega Customer Decision Hub destination in Adobe Experience Platform to send profile attributes and segment membership data to Pega Customer Descision Hub for next-best-action decisioning. 

Profile segment membership from Adobe Experience Platform, when loaded into Pega Customer Decision Hub, can be used as predictor in adaptive models and help deliver the right contextual and behavioral data for next-best-action decisioning purposes.

## Use cases 

To help you better understand how and when you should use the Customer Decision Hub destination, here are sample use cases that Adobe Experience Platform customers can solve by using this destination.
