## Prerequisites {#prerequisites}

Make sure you meet the prerequisites below in order to export account audiences to LinkedIn:

### LinkedIn account prerequisites {#LinkedIn-account-prerequisites}

Before you can use the [!UICONTROL (Companies) LinkedIn Matched Audience] destination, make sure your [!DNL LinkedIn Campaign Manager] account has the [!DNL Creative Manager] permission level or higher.

To learn how to edit your [!DNL LinkedIn Campaign Manager] user permissions, see [Add, Edit, and Remove User Permissions on Advertising Accounts](https://www.linkedin.com/help/lms/answer/5753) in the LinkedIn documentation.

### ID matching requirements {#id-matching-requirements}

[!DNL LinkedIn Matched Audiences] requires that no personally identifiable information (PII) is sent in clear. Therefore, the audiences activated to the destination can be keyed off *hashed* identifiers, such as email addresses or mobile device IDs.

Depending on the type of IDs that you ingest into Adobe Experience Platform, you must adhere to their corresponding requirements.

### Email hashing requirements {#email-hashing-requirements}

You can hash email addresses before ingesting them into Adobe Experience Platform, or use email addresses in clear in Experience Platform, and have [!DNL Platform] hash them on activation.

To learn about ingesting email addresses in Experience Platform, see the [batch ingestion overview](/help/ingestion/batch-ingestion/overview.md) and the [streaming ingestion overview](/help/ingestion/streaming-ingestion/overview.md).

If you select to hash the email addresses yourself, make sure to comply with the following requirements:

* Trim all leading and trailing spaces from the email string. For example: `johndoe@example.com`, not `<space>johndoe@example.com<space>`;
* When hashing the email strings, make sure to hash the lowercase string;
  * Example: `example@email.com`, not `EXAMPLE@EMAIL.COM`;
* Ensure that the hashed string is all lowercase
  * Example: `55e79200c1635b37ad31a378c39feb12f120f116625093a19bc32fff15041149`, not `55E79200C1635B37AD31A378C39FEB12F120F116625093A19bC32FFF15041149`;
* Do not salt the string.

>[!NOTE]
>
>Data from unhashed namespaces is automatically hashed by [!DNL Platform] upon activation.
> Attribute source data is not automatically hashed.
> 
>In the [Identity Mapping](../../ui/activate-segment-streaming-destinations.md#mapping) step, when your source field contains unhashed attributes, check the **[!UICONTROL Apply transformation]** option, to have [!DNL Platform] automatically hash the data on activation.
> 
> The **[!UICONTROL Apply transformation]** option is only displayed when you select attributes as source fields. It is not displayed when you choose namespaces.
