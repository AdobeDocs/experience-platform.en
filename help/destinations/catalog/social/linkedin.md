## Use cases

To help you better understand how and when to use the [!DNL LinkedIn Matched Audiences] destination, here is a use case that Adobe Experience Platform customers can solve by using this feature.

A software company organizes a conference and wants to keep in touch with participants, and show them personalized offers based on their conference attendance status. The company can ingest email addresses or mobile device IDs from their own [!DNL CRM] into Adobe Experience Platform. Then, they can build audiences from their own offline data, and send these audiences to the [!DNL LinkedIn] social platform, optimizing their advertising spending.

## Supported identities {#supported-identities}

[!DNL LinkedIn Matched Audiences] supports the activation of identities described in the table below. Learn more about [identities](/help/identity-service/namespaces.md).

|Target Identity|Description|Considerations|
|---|---|---|
|GAID|Google Advertising ID|Select this target identity when your source identity is a GAID namespace.|
|IDFA|Apple ID for Advertisers|Select this target identity when your source identity is an IDFA namespace.|
|email_lc_sha256|Email addresses hashed with the SHA256 algorithm|Both plain text and SHA256 hashed email addresses are supported by Adobe Experience Platform. Follow the instructions in the [ID matching requirements](#id-matching-requirements-id-matching-requirements) section and use the appropriate namespaces for plain text and hashed emails, respectively. When your source field contains unhashed attributes, check the **[!UICONTROL Apply transformation]** option, to have [!DNL Platform] automatically hash the data on activation.|

## Export type and frequency {#export-type-frequency}

Refer to the table below for information about the destination export type and frequency.

| Item | Type | Notes |
---------|----------|---------|
| Export type | **[!UICONTROL Audience export]** | You are exporting all members of an audience with the identifiers (name, phone number, and others) used in the [!DNL LinkedIn Matched Audiences] destination.|
| Export frequency | **[!UICONTROL Streaming]** | Streaming destinations are "always on" API-based connections. As soon as a profile is updated in Experience Platform based on audience evaluation, the connector sends the update downstream to the destination platform.

## LinkedIn account prerequisites {#LinkedIn-account-prerequisites}

Before you can use the [!UICONTROL LinkedIn Matched Audience] destination, make sure your [!DNL LinkedIn Campaign Manager] account has the [!DNL Creative Manager] permission level or higher.

To learn how to edit your [!DNL LinkedIn Campaign Manager] user permissions, see [Add, Edit, and Remove User Permissions on Advertising Accounts](https://www.linkedin.com/help/lms/answer/5753) in the LinkedIn documentation.

## ID matching requirements {#id-matching-requirements}

[!DNL LinkedIn Matched Audiences] requires that no personally identifiable information (PII) is sent in clear. Therefore, the audiences activated to [!DNL LinkedIn Matched Audiences] can be keyed off *hashed* identifiers, such as email addresses or mobile device IDs.

Depending on the type of IDs that you ingest into Adobe Experience Platform, you must adhere to their corresponding requirements.

## Email hashing requirements {#email-hashing-requirements}

You can hash email addresses before ingesting them into Adobe Experience Platform, or use email addresses in clear in Experience Platform, and have [!DNL Platform] hash them on activation.

To learn about ingesting email addresses in Experience Platform, see the [batch ingestion overview](/help/ingestion/batch-ingestion/overview.md) and the [streaming ingestion overview](/help/ingestion/streaming-ingestion/overview.md).

If you select to hash the email addresses yourself, make sure to comply with the following requirements:

* Trim all leading and trailing spaces from the email string. For example: `johndoe@example.com`, not `<space>johndoe@example.com<space>`;
* When hashing the email strings, make sure to hash the lowercase string;
  * Example: `example@email.com`, not `EXAMPLE@EMAIL.COM`;
* Ensure that the hashed string is all lowercase
  * Example: `55e79200c1635b37ad31a378c39feb12f120f116625093a19bc32fff15041149`, not `55E79200C1635B37AD31A378C39FEB12F120F116625093A19bC32FFF15041149`;
* Do not salt the string.
