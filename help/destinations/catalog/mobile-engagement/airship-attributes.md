## Enable attributes {#enable-attributes}

Adobe Experience Platform profile attributes are similar to [!DNL Airship] attributes and can be easily mapped to one another in Platform using the mapping tool demonstrated further below on this page.

[!DNL Airship] projects have several predefined and default attributes. If you have a custom attribute, you must define it in [!DNL Airship] first. See [Set Up and Manage Attributes](https://docs.airship.com/tutorials/audience/attributes/) for details.

## Generate bearer token {#bearer-token}

Go to **[!UICONTROL Settings]** Â» **[!UICONTROL APIs & Integrations]** in the [Airship dashboard](https://go.airship.com) and select **[!UICONTROL Tokens]** in the left-hand menu.

Click **[!UICONTROL Create Token]**.

Provide a user-friendly name for your token, e.g., "Adobe Attributes Destination", and select "All Access" for the role.

Click **[!UICONTROL Create Token]** and save the details as confidential.

## Use cases {#use-cases}

To help you better understand how and when you should use the [!DNL Airship Attributes] destination, here are sample use cases that Adobe Experience Platform customers can solve by using this destination.

### Use case #1

Leverage profile data collected within Adobe Experience Platform for personalization of the message and rich content within any of [!DNL Airship]'s channels. For example, leverage [!DNL Experience Platform] profile data to set location attributes within [!DNL Airship]. This will enable a hotel brand to display an image for the nearest hotel location for each user.

### Use case #2

Leverage Attributes from Adobe Experience Platform to further enrich [!DNL Airship] profiles and combine it with SDK or [!DNL Airship] predictive data. For example, a retailer can create an audience with loyalty status and location data (attributes from Platform) and [!DNL Airship] predicted to churn data to send highly targeted messages to users in the gold loyalty status who live in Las Vegas, NV, and have a high probability of churning.

## Mapping considerations {#mapping-considerations}

[!DNL Airship] attributes can be set either on a channel, which represents device instance, e.g., iPhone, or a named user, which maps all of a user's devices to a common identifier such as a customer ID. If you have plain text (unhashed) email addresses as primary identity in your schema, select the email field in your **[!UICONTROL Source Attributes]** and map to the [!DNL Airship] named user in the right column under **[!UICONTROL Target Identities]**, as shown below.

![Named User Mapping](../../assets/catalog/mobile-engagement/airship/mapping.png)

For identifiers that should be mapped to a channel, i.e., a device, map to the appropriate channel based on the source. The following images show how two mappings are created:

* IDFA iOS Advertising ID to an [!DNL Airship] iOS channel
* Adobe `fullName` attribute to [!DNL Airship] "Full Name" attribute

>[!NOTE]

>Use the user-friendly name that appears in the [!DNL Airship] dashboard when selecting the target field for your attribute mapping.
