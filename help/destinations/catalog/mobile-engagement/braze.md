## Mapping considerations {#mapping-considerations}

To correctly send your audience data from [!DNL Adobe Experience Platform] to the [!DNL Braze] destination, you need to go through the field mapping step.

Mapping consists of creating a link between your [!DNL Experience Data Model] (XDM) schema fields in your [!DNL Platform] account, and their corresponding equivalents from the target destination.

To correctly map your XDM fields to the [!DNL Braze] destination fields, follow these steps:

In the [!UICONTROL Mapping] step, click **[!UICONTROL Add new mapping]**.
   
![Braze Destination Add Mapping](../../assets/catalog/mobile-engagement/braze/mapping.png)

In the [!UICONTROL Source Field] section, click the arrow button next to the empty field.
   
![Braze Destination Source Mapping](../../assets/catalog/mobile-engagement/braze/mapping-source.png)

In the [!UICONTROL Select source field] window, you can choose between two categories of XDM fields:
* [!UICONTROL Select attributes]: use this option to map a specific field from your XDM schema to a [!DNL Braze] attribute.

![Braze Destination Mapping Source Attribute](../../assets/catalog/mobile-engagement/braze/mapping-attributes.png)

* [!UICONTROL Select identity namespace]: Use this option to map a [!DNL Platform] identity namespace to a [!DNL Braze] namespace.

![Braze Destination Mapping Source Namespace](../../assets/catalog/mobile-engagement/braze/mapping-namespaces.png)

Choose your source field, then click **[!UICONTROL Select]**.

In the [!UICONTROL Target Field] section, click the mapping icon to the right of the field.
   
![Braze Destination Target Mapping](../../assets/catalog/mobile-engagement/braze/mapping-target.png)

In the [!UICONTROL Select target field] window, you can choose between two categories of target fields:
* [!UICONTROL Select identity namespace]: Use this option to map [!DNL Platform] identity namespaces to [!DNL Braze] identity namespaces.
* [!UICONTROL Select custom attributes]: Use this option to map XDM attributes to custom [!DNL Braze] attributes that you defined in your [!DNL Braze] account. <br> You can also use this option to rename existing XDM attributes into [!DNL Braze]. For instance, mapping a `lastName` XDM attribute to a custom `Last_Name` attribute in [!DNL Braze], will create the `Last_Name` attribute in [!DNL Braze], if it doesn't already exist, and map the `lastName` XDM attribute to it.
  
![Braze Destination Target Mapping Fields](../../assets/catalog/mobile-engagement/braze/mapping-target-fields.png)

Choose your target field, then click **[!UICONTROL Select]**.

You should now see your field mapping in the list.
   
![Braze Destination Mapping Complete](../../assets/catalog/mobile-engagement/braze/mapping-complete.png)
   
To add more mappings, repeat the previous steps.

## Mapping Example {#mapping-example}

Let's say your XDM profile schema and your [!DNL Braze] instance contain the following attributes and identities:

||XDM Profile Schema|[!DNL Braze] Instance|
|---|---|---|
|Attributes|<ul><li><code>person.name.firstName</code></li><li><code>person.name.lastName</code></li><li><code>mobilePhone.number</code></li></ul>|<ul><li><code>FirstName</code></li><li><code>LastName</code></li><li><code>PhoneNumber</code></li></ul>|
|Identities|<ul><li><code>Email</code></li><li><code>Google Ad ID (GAID)</code></li><li><code>Apple ID For Advertisers (IDFA)</code></li></ul>|<ul><li><code>external_id</code></li></ul>|

The correct mapping would look like this:

## Exported data {#exported-data}

To verify if data has been exported successfully to the [!DNL Braze] destination, check your [!DNL Braze] account. [!DNL Adobe Experience Platform] audiences are exported to [!DNL Braze] under the `AdobeExperiencePlatformSegments` attribute.

## Troubleshooting {#troubleshooting}

**I received a timeout error while activating my audiences to this destination. What should I do?**

Occasionally, audience activation to this destination may result in a timeout error. This error does not alywas indicate an activation issue. 

If you receive a timeout error, check the audience size in the destination platform. If the audience size is correct, then the integration is working as expected.
