# Marketo Engage destination {#beta-marketo-engage-destination}

## Overview {#overview}

Marketo Engage is the only end-to-end customer experience management (CXM) solution for marketing, advertising, analytics, and commerce. It lets you automate and manage activities from CRM lead management and customer engagement to account-based marketing and revenue attribution.

The destination enables marketers to push segments created in Adobe Experience Platform to Marketo where they will appear as static lists.

## Supported identities {#supported-identities}

|Target Identity|Description|
|---|---|
|ECID|A namespace that represents ECID. This namespace can also be referred to by the following aliases: “Adobe Marketing Cloud ID”, “Adobe Experience Cloud ID”, “Adobe Experience Platform ID”. See the following document on [ECID](/help/identity-service/ecid.md) for more information.|
|Email|A namespace that represents an email address. This type of namespace is often associated to a single person and therefore can be used to identify that person across different channels.|

>[!NOTE]
>
>In the [mapping step](/help/destinations/ui/activate-segment-streaming-destinations.md#mapping) of the activate destination workflow, it is *mandatory* to map identities and *optional* to map attributes. Mapping Email and/or ECID from the Identity Namespace tab is the most important thing to do to ensure the person is matched in Marketo. Mapping Email ensures the highest match rate.

## Export type and frequency {#export-type-frequency}

Refer to the table below for information about the destination export type and frequency.

| Item | Type | Notes |
---------|----------|---------|
| Export type | **[!UICONTROL Segment export]** | You are exporting all members of a segment (audience) with the identifiers (email, ECID) used in the Marketo Engage destination.|
| Export frequency | **[!UICONTROL Streaming]** | Streaming destinations are "always on" API-based connections. As soon as a profile is updated in Experience Platform based on segment evaluation, the connector sends the update downstream to the destination platform. Read more about [streaming destinations](/help/destinations/destination-types.md#streaming-destinations).|
