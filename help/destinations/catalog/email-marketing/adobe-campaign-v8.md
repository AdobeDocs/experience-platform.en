## Overview {#overview}

Adobe Campaign provides a platform for designing cross-channel customer experiences and an environment for visual campaign orchestration, real-time interaction management and cross channel execution.
See [Get Started with Campaign](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/campaign/campaign-v8/start/get-started.html?lang=en) for more information.

To send segment data to Adobe Campaign, you must first [connect the destination](#connect) in Adobe Experience Platform, and then set up a data import from your storage location into Adobe Campaign.

## Export type and frequency {#export-type-frequency}

Refer to the table below for information about the destination export type and frequency.

| Item | Type | Notes |
---------|----------|---------|
| Export type | **[!UICONTROL Profile-based]** | You are exporting all members of a segment, together with the desired schema fields (for example: email address, phone number, last name), as chosen in the select profile attributes screen of the [destination activation workflow](/help/destinations/ui/activate-batch-profile-destinations.md#select-attributes).|
| Export frequency | **[!UICONTROL Batch]** | Batch destinations export files to downstream platforms in increments of three, six, eight, twelve, or twenty-four hours. Read more about [batch file-based destinations](/help/destinations/destination-types.md#file-based).|
