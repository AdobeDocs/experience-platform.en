# [!DNL Oracle Eloqua] connection

[[!DNL Oracle Eloqua]](https://www.oracle.com/cx/marketing/automation/) is a software as a service (SaaS) platform for marketing automation offered by [!DNL Oracle] that aims to help B2B marketers and organizations manage marketing campaigns and sales lead generation. 

To send segment data to [!DNL Oracle Eloqua], you must first [connect the destination](#connect-destination) in Adobe Experience Platform, and then [set up a data import](#import-data-into-eloqua) from your storage location into [!DNL Oracle Eloqua].

## Export type {#export-type}

**Profile-based** - you are exporting all members of a segment, together with the desired schema fields (for example: email address, phone number, last name), as chosen from the select attributes screen of the [audience activation workflow](../../ui/activate-batch-profile-destinations.md#select-attributes).

## IP address allow list {#allow-list}

When setting up email marketing destinations with SFTP storage, Adobe recommends that you add certain IP ranges to your allow list.

Refer to [IP address allow list for cloud storage destinations](../cloud-storage/ip-address-allow-list.md) if you need to add Adobe IPs to your allow list.

## Connect to the destination {#connect}

To connect to this destination, follow the steps described in the [destination configuration tutorial](../../ui/connect-destination.md).

This destination supports the following connection types:

* **[!UICONTROL SFTP with Password]**
* **[!UICONTROL SFTP with SSH Key]**

### Connection parameters {#parameters}

While [setting up](../../ui/connect-destination.md) this destination, you must provide the following information:

* For **[!UICONTROL SFTP with Password]** connections, you must provide:
  * [!UICONTROL Domain]
  * [!UICONTROL Port]
  * [!UICONTROL Username]
  * [!UICONTROL Password]
* For **[!UICONTROL SFTP with SSH Key]** connections, you must provide:
  * [!UICONTROL Domain]
  * [!UICONTROL Port]
  * [!UICONTROL Username]
  * [!UICONTROL SSH Key]

* Optionally, you can attach your RSA-formatted public key to add encryption with PGP/GPG to your exported files under the **[!UICONTROL Key]** section. Your public key must be written as a [!DNL Base64] encoded string.
* **[!UICONTROL Name]**: Pick a relevant name for your destination.
* **[!UICONTROL Description]**: Enter a description for your destination.
* **[!UICONTROL Folder Path]**: Provide the path in your storage location where Platform will deposit your export data as CSV or tab-delimited files.
* **[!UICONTROL File Format]**: **CSV** or **TAB_DELIMITED**. Select which file format to export to your storage location.

<!--

Commenting out Amazon S3 bucket part for now until support is clarified

- **[!UICONTROL Bucket name]**: Your Amazon S3 bucket, where Platform will deposit the data export. Your input must be between 3 and 63 characters long. Must begin and end with a letter or number. Must contain only lowercase letters, numbers, or hyphens ( - ). Must not be formatted as an IP address (for example, 192.100.1.1).

## Activate segments to this destination {#activate}

See [Activate audience data to batch profile export destinations](../../ui/activate-batch-profile-destinations.md) for instructions on activating audience segments to this destination.

## Set up data import into [!DNL Oracle Eloqua] {#import-data-into-eloqua}
