# [!DNL Salesforce Marketing Cloud Account Engagement] connection

[[!DNL Salesforce Marketing Cloud Account Engagement]](https://www.salesforce.com/products/marketing-cloud/overview/) *(formerly known as [!DNL Pardot])* allows you to capture and track leads by building templates, drag-and-drop builders; its powerful visual editor allows you to easily create custom landing pages, forms, and offers that attract potential leads for your sales teams. When someone engages with your forms, the lead is auto captured, and you get notified. Leads are also automatically scored and graded, so that those most likely to convert can be prioritized. Your forms can also trigger changes in lead scores upon conversion. [!DNL Marketing Cloud Account Engagement] enables you to design lead tracks for all stages of the pipeline for targeted market segments and customer groups through email drip campaigns, lead management with nurturing and scoring and campaign segmentation.

Compared to [!DNL Salesforce Marketing Cloud Engagement] which is more oriented towards **B2C** marketing, [!DNL Marketing Cloud Account Engagement] is ideal for **B2B** use cases involving multiple departments and decision makers which require longer sales and decision cycles. In addition, you also maintain closer proximity and integration with your CRM to make appropriate sales and marketing decisions. *Note, Experience Platform also has connections for [!DNL Salesforce Marketing Cloud Engagement], you can check them on the [[!DNL Salesforce Marketing Cloud]](/help/destinations/catalog/email-marketing/salesforce-marketing-cloud.md) and [[!DNL (API) Salesforce Marketing Cloud]](/help/destinations/catalog/email-marketing/salesforce-marketing-cloud-exact-target.md) pages.*

This [!DNL Adobe Experience Platform] [destination](/help/destinations/home.md) leverages the [[!DNL Salesforce Account Engagement API > Prospect Upsert by Email]](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/marketing/pardot/guide/prospect-v5.html#prospect-upsert-by-email) endpoint, to add / update your leads after activating them within a new [!DNL Marketing Cloud Account Engagement] segment.

[!DNL Marketing Cloud Account Engagement] uses OAuth 2 with Client Credentials as the authentication mechanism to communicate with the [!DNL Account Engagement] API. Instructions to authenticate to your [!DNL Marketing Cloud Account Engagement] instance are further below, in the [Authenticate to destination](#authenticate) section.

## Use cases {#use-cases}

To help you better understand how and when you should use the [!DNL Marketing Cloud Account Engagement] destination, here is a sample use case that Adobe Experience Platform customers can solve by using this destination.

### Send emails to contacts for marketing campaigns {#use-case-send-emails}

The marketing department of an online platform wants to broadcast an email based marketing campaign to a curated audience of B2B leads. The platform's marketing team can add new leads / update existing lead information through Adobe Experience Platform, build segments from their own offline data, and send these segments to [!DNL Marketing Cloud Account Engagement], which can then be used to send the marketing campaign email.

## Prerequisites {#prerequisites}

Refer to the sections below for any prerequisites that you need to set up in Experience Platform and [!DNL Salesforce] and for information that you need to gather before working with the [!DNL Marketing Cloud Account Engagement] destination.

### Mapping considerations and example {#mapping-considerations-example}

To correctly send your audience data from Adobe Experience Platform to the [!DNL Marketing Cloud Account Engagement] destination, you need to go through the field mapping step. Mapping consists of creating a link between your Experience Data Model (XDM) schema fields in your Platform account and their corresponding equivalents from the target destination. 

To correctly map your XDM fields to the [!DNL Marketing Cloud Account Engagement] destination fields, follow the steps below.

1. In the **[!UICONTROL Mapping]** step, select **[!UICONTROL Add new mapping]**. You will see a new mapping row on the screen.
1. In the **[!UICONTROL Select source field]** window, choose the **[!UICONTROL Select attributes]** category and select the XDM attribute or choose the **[!UICONTROL Select identity namespace]** and select an identity.
1. In the **[!UICONTROL Select target field]** window, choose the **[!UICONTROL Select identity namespace]** and select an identity or choose **[!UICONTROL Select custom attributes]** category and specify from the list of [!DNL Prospect API fields](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/marketing/pardot/guide/prospect-v5.html#fields) from the available schema.

    * Repeat these steps to add any mappings between your XDM profile schema and [!DNL Marketing Cloud Account Engagement]:
        | Source Field | Target Field | Mandatory |
        | --- | --- | --- |
        |`IdentityMap: Email`|`Identity: email`| Yes |
        |`xdm: MailingAddress.city`|`xdm: city`| |
        |`xdm: person.name.firstName`|`Attribute: firstName`| |

    * An example with the above mappings is shown below:
    ![Platform UI screenshot example showing Target mappings.](../../assets/catalog/email-marketing/salesforce-marketing-cloud-account-engagement/mappings.png)

When you have finished providing the mappings for your destination connection, select **[!UICONTROL Next]**.

## Validate data export {#exported-data}

To validate that you have correctly set up the destination, follow the steps below:

1. Navigate to one of the segments you had selected. Select the **[!DNL Activation data]** tab. The **[!UICONTROL Mapping ID]** column displays the name of the custom field which is generated within the [!DNL Marketing Cloud Account Engagement Prospects] page.
