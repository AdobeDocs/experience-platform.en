# [!DNL Sendgrid] connection

## Overview {#overview}

[Sendgrid](https://www.sendgrid.com) is a popular customer communication platform for transactional and marketing emails.

This [!DNL Adobe Experience Platform] [destination](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-platform/destinations/home.html?lang=en) leverages the [[!DNL Sendgrid Marketing Contacts API]](https://api.sendgrid.com/v3/marketing/contacts) allowing you to ingest your first-party email profiles and activate it within a new Sendgrid segment for your business needs.

* It uses [[!DNL Bearer tokens]](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-platform/landing/platform-apis/api-authentication.html#generate-an-access-token) as an authentication mechanism to communicate with the Sendgrid API.

## Prerequisites {#prerequisites}

The following items are required before you start configuring the destination.

1. You need to have a Sendgrid account. 
    * Go to the Sendgrid [signup](https://signup.sendgrid.com/) page to register and create a Sendgrid account, if you do not have one already.
1. After logging in to the Sendgrid portal, you also need to generate an API token.
1. Navigate to the Sendgrid website and access *[!DNL Settings > API Keys]* page. Alternatively, refer to the [Sendgrid documentation](https://app.sendgrid.com/settings/api_keys) to access the appropriate section in the Sendgrid app.
1. Then select the *[!DNL Create API Key]* button.
    * Refer to the [Sendgrid documentation](https://docs.sendgrid.com/ui/account-and-settings/api-keys#creating-an-api-key), if you need guidance on what actions to perform. 
    * If you would like to programmatically generate your API Key, please refer to the [Sendgrid documentation](https://docs.sendgrid.com/api-reference/api-keys/create-api-keys).

![](../../assets/catalog/email-marketing/sendgrid/01-api-key.jpg)

* Before activating data to the Sendgrid destination you should have created a [schema](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-platform/xdm/schema/composition.html), [dataset](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/platform-learn/tutorials/data-ingestion/create-datasets-and-ingest-data.html?lang=en), and [segment](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/platform-learn/tutorials/segments/create-segments.html?lang=en) in Experience Platform.
    * If required please refer to the [Platform documentation](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/platform-learn/tutorials/destinations/create-destinations-and-activate-data.html?lang=en). 

>[!IMPORTANT]
>* During *Datasets* creation the *alternate email* value should be unique as compared to the value used for email *(indicated by the mapping's below)* else the profile when sent to Sendgrid will throw an error.

>* Please note the functionality to remove profiles from Sendgrid when they are removed from segments is yet to be developed.

## Supported identities {#supported-identities}

*Sendgrid* supports the activation of identities described in the table below. Learn more about [identities](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-platform/identity/namespaces.html?lang=en#getting-started).

|Target Identity|Description|Considerations|
|---|---|---|
|email |Email address|Note both plain text and SHA256 hashed email addresses are supported by [!DNL Adobe Experience Platform]. If the Experience platform source field contains unhashed attributes, check the [!UICONTROL Apply transformation] option, to have [!DNL Platform] automatically hash the data on activation.<br/><br/> However as **Sendgrid** does not support hashed email addresses hence only plain text data without transformation is sent|

## Export type and frequency {#export-type-frequency}

Refer to the table below for information about the destination export type and frequency.

| Item | Type | Notes |
---------|----------|---------|
| Export type | **[!UICONTROL Profile-based]** | You are exporting all members of a segment, together with the desired schema fields (for example: email address, phone number, last name), as chosen in the select profile attributes screen of the [destination activation workflow](/help/destinations/ui/activate-batch-profile-destinations.md#select-attributes).|
| Export frequency | **[!UICONTROL Streaming]** | Streaming destinations are "always on" API-based connections. As soon as a profile is updated in Experience Platform based on segment evaluation, the connector sends the update downstream to the destination platform. Read more about [streaming destinations](/help/destinations/destination-types.md#streaming-destinations).|
