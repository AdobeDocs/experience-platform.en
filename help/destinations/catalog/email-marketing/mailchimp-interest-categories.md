# [!DNL Mailchimp Interest Categories] connection

[[!DNL Mailchimp]](https://mailchimp.com) *(also known as [!DNL Intuit Mailchimp])* is a popular marketing automation platform and email marketing service used by businesses to manage and talk to contacts *(clients, customers, or other interested parties)* using mailing lists and email marketing campaigns.

[!DNL Mailchimp Interest Categories] uses [audiences](https://mailchimp.com/help/getting-started-audience/) and [groups](https://mailchimp.com/help/getting-started-with-groups/). Groups can be used to help organize your contacts within [!DNL Mailchimp] based on their interests and preferences and then broadcast group specific campaign emails.

<!--
Compared to [!DNL Mailchimp Tags] which you would use for internal classification, [!DNL Mailchimp Interest Categories] is meant to manage subscriptions to topics of interest that your contacts might be interested in. *Note, Experience Platform also has a connection for [!DNL Mailchimp Tags], you can check it out on the [[!DNL Mailchimp Tags]](/help/destinations/catalog/email-marketing/mailchimp-tags.md) page.*
-->

This [!DNL Adobe Experience Platform] [destination](/help/destinations/home.md) leverages the [[!DNL Mailchimp batch subscribe or unsubscribe API]](https://mailchimp.com/developer/marketing/api/lists/batch-subscribe-or-unsubscribe/) endpoint. You can **add new contacts** or **update the information of existing [!DNL Mailchimp] contacts**, then **add or remove them from their desired groups** within an existing [!DNL Mailchimp] audience after activating them within a new segment. [!DNL Mailchimp Interest Groups] uses the selected segment names from Platform as the tag names within [!DNL Mailchimp].

[!DNL Mailchimp Interest Group] uses OAuth 2 with Authorization Code to communicate with the [!DNL Mailchimp] API. Instructions to authenticate to your [!DNL Mailchimp Interest Categories] instance are further below, in the [Authenticate to destination](#authenticate) section.

## Use cases {#use-cases}

To help you better understand how and when you should use the [!DNL Mailchimp Interest Categories] destination, here is a sample use case that Adobe Experience Platform customers can solve by using this destination.

### Send emails to contacts for marketing campaigns {#use-case-send-emails}

The sales department of a sporting goods website wants to broadcast an email based marketing campaign to a list of contacts who have self identified themselves as being interested in soccer. The lists of contacts are segregated as batches in the data export received from the development team of the website and therefore need to be tracked. The team identifies an existing [!DNL Mailchimp] audience and starts building the Experience Platform segment's into which the contacts from each list are added. After sending these segments to [!DNL Mailchimp Interest Categories] if any contacts do not exist in the selected [!DNL Mailchimp] audience they get added to a group having the segment name the contact belongs to. If any contacts already exist in the [!DNL Mailchimp] audience or group then their information is updated. Once the data is sent over to [!DNL Mailchimp Interest Categories] the Sales team can select and send the marketing campaign email to the soccer interest group within the [!DNL Mailchimp] audience.

## Prerequisites {#prerequisites}

Refer to the sections below for any prerequisites that you need to set up in Experience Platform and [!DNL Mailchimp] and for information that you need to gather before working with the [!DNL Mailchimp Interest Categories] destination.

Read the [access control overview](/help/access-control/ui/overview.md) or contact your product administrator to obtain the required permissions.

Read [Activate profiles and segments to streaming segment export destinations](/help/destinations/ui/activate-segment-streaming-destinations.md) for instructions on activating audience segments to this destination.

### Mapping considerations and example {#mapping-considerations-example}

To correctly send your audience data from Adobe Experience Platform to the [!DNL Mailchimp Interest Categories] destination, you need to go through the field mapping step. Mapping consists of creating a link between your Experience Data Model (XDM) schema fields in your Platform account and their corresponding equivalents from the target destination.

To correctly map your XDM fields to the [!DNL Mailchimp Interest Categories] destination fields, follow the steps below:

1. In the **[!UICONTROL Mapping]** step, select **[!UICONTROL Add new mapping]**. You will see a new mapping row on the screen.
1. In the **[!UICONTROL Select source field]** window, choose the **[!UICONTROL Select attributes]** category and select the XDM attribute or choose the **[!UICONTROL Select identity namespace]** and select an identity.
1. In the **[!UICONTROL Select target field]** window, choose the **[!UICONTROL Select identity namespace]** and select an identity or choose **[!UICONTROL Select attributes]** category and select from the list of attributes populated from the [!DNL Mailchimp] API. *Note any custom attributes that have been added to the selected [!DNL Mailchimp] Audience will also be available.*

    The default mappings available between your XDM profile schema and [!DNL Mailchimp Interest Categories] will be as below:
    | Source Field | Target Field | Notes |
    | --- | --- | --- |
    |`IdentityMap: Email`|`Identity: email`| Mandatory: Yes |
    |`xdm: person.name.firstName`|`Attribute: FNAME`| |
    |`xdm: person.name.lastName`|`Attribute: LNAME`| |
    |`xdm: person.birthDayAndMonth`|`Attribute: BIRTHDAY`| |

    Additionally, `ADDRESS` is a special target field known as a `merge field` within your [!DNL Mailchimp] audience. The [[!DNL Mailchimp] documentation](https://mailchimp.com/developer/marketing/docs/merge-fields/) defines the required keys as `addr1`, `city`, `state`, and `zip`, and the optional keys `addr2` and `country`. The values for these fields must be strings. If any of the `ADDRESS` field mappings are present the destination passes the `ADDRESS` object to the [!DNL Mailchimp] API for update. Any `ADDRESS` fields that are not mapped has its value default to `NULL` except for country which defaults to `US`. 
    
    The mappings available for the `ADDRESS` field are as below:

    | Source Field | Target Field |
    | --- | --- |
    | `xdm: workAddress.street1` | `Attribute: ADDRESS.addr1` |
    | `xdm: workAddress.street2` | `Attribute: ADDRESS.addr2` |
    | `xdm: workAddress.city` | `Attribute: ADDRESS.city` |
    | `xdm: workAddress.state` | `Attribute: ADDRESS.state` |
    | `xdm: workAddress.postalCode` | `Attribute: ADDRESS.zip` |
    | `xdm: workAddress.country` | `Attribute: ADDRESS.country` |

    For example, you want to update the value for `country` with the contact's existing address field `addr1`, `city`, `state`, and `zip` values as `132, My Street, Kingston`, `New York`, `New York` and `12401`. To update the `country` you need to pass the existing values with changes *(if any)* and the new value for country. So the values in your dataset should be `132, My Street, Kingston`, `New York`, `New York`, `12401` and `US`. To reiterate if you only pass `country` and do not provide values for `addr1`, `city`, `state`, and `zip` they will be overwritten by `NULL`.

    An example with the completed mappings is shown below:
    ![Platform UI screenshot example showing field mappings.](../../assets/catalog/email-marketing/mailchimp-interest-categories/mappings.png)

When you have finished providing the mappings for your destination connection, select **[!UICONTROL Next]**.

## Validate data export {#exported-data}

To validate that you have correctly set up the destination, follow the steps below:

* Log in to your [[!DNL Mailchimp]](https://login.mailchimp.com/) account. Then navigate to the **[!DNL Audience]** page. Next expand the **[!DNL Manage Contacts]** menu and select **[!DNL Groups]**.

![Mailchimp UI screenshot showing the Audience group page.](../../assets/catalog/email-marketing/mailchimp-interest-categories/audience-groups.png)

* Select the Group and check if the selected segments are created as categories sharing the segment name from Platform followed by an auto generated suffix. 
* Contacts whose emails did not exist in the group will be added to the newly created category.
* For contacts that already exist within the group the attribute field data will be updated. The contact is also added to the newly created category.

![Mailchimp UI screenshot showing the Audience group categories.](../../assets/catalog/email-marketing/mailchimp-interest-categories/audience-groups-category.png)

## Data usage and governance {#data-usage-governance}

All [!DNL Adobe Experience Platform] destinations are compliant with data usage policies when handling your data. For detailed information on how [!DNL Adobe Experience Platform] enforces data governance, see the [Data Governance overview](/help/data-governance/home.md).

## Errors and troubleshooting {#errors-and-troubleshooting}

When creating the destination, you might receive the following error messages: `Cannot have more than 60 interests per list (Across all categories)` or `400 BAD_REQUEST`. This happens when you exceed the 60 group names in a single group or across several groups within the same audience limit, as described in the [guardrails](#guardrails) section. To fix this error, make sure you are not exceeding the group name limit in [!DNL Mailchimp].

Refer to the [[!DNL Mailchimp] errors page](https://mailchimp.com/developer/marketing/docs/errors/) for a comprehensive list of status and error codes with explanations.
