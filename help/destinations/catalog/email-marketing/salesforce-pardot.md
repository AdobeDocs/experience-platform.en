# [!DNL Salesforce Pardot] connection

[[!DNL Salesforce Pardot]](https://www.salesforce.com/products/marketing-cloud/overview/) *(now renamed as [!DNL Marketing Cloud Account Engagement])* allows you to capture and track leads by building templates, drag-and-drop builders; its powerful visual editor allows you to easily create custom landing pages, forms, and offers that attract potential leads for your sales teams. When someone engages with your forms, the lead is auto captured, and you get notified. Leads are also automatically scored and graded, so that those most likely to convert can be prioritized. Your forms can also trigger changes in lead scores upon conversion. [!DNL Salesforce Pardot] enables you to design lead tracks for all stages of the pipeline for targeted market segments and customer groups through email drip campaigns, lead management with nurturing and scoring and campaign segmentation.

This [!DNL Adobe Experience Platform] [destination](/help/destinations/home.md) leverages the [[!DNL Account Engagement]](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/marketing/pardot/guide/overview.html) API, to work with leads for your sales needs after activating them within a new [!DNL Salesforce Pardot] segment.

[!DNL Salesforce Pardot] uses OAuth 2 with Client Credentials as the authentication mechanism to communicate with the [!DNL Account Engagement] API. Instructions to authenticate to your [!DNL Salesforce Pardot] instance are further below, in the [Authenticate to destination](#authenticate) section.

## Use cases {#use-cases}

To help you better understand how and when you should use the [!DNL Salesforce Pardot] destination, here is a sample use case that Adobe Experience Platform customers can solve by using this destination.

### Send emails to contacts for marketing campaigns {#use-case-send-emails}

The marketing department of an online platform wants to broadcast an email based marketing campaign to a curated audience of B2B leads. The platform's marketing team can add new leads / update existing lead information through Adobe Experience Platform, build segments from their own offline data, and send these segments to [!DNL Salesforce Pardot], which can then be used to send the marketing campaign email.

## Prerequisites {#prerequisites}

Refer to the sections below for any prerequisites that have to be setup / information that is to be gathered before working with the [!DNL Salesforce Pardot] destination.

### Prerequisites in Experience Platform {#prerequisites-in-experience-platform}

Before activating data to the [!DNL Salesforce Pardot] destination, you must have a [schema](/help/xdm/schema/composition.md), a [dataset](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/platform-learn/tutorials/data-ingestion/create-datasets-and-ingest-data.html?lang=en), and [segments](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/platform-learn/tutorials/segments/create-segments.html?lang=en) created in [!DNL Experience Platform].

>[!TIP]
>
>The [!DNL Salesforce Pardot] destination uses the selected segment names, to create custom prospect fields in [!DNL Salesforce Pardot], and update them with the Experience Platform segment status. The destination automatically replaces whitespace or special characters with the underscore `(_)` character as a separator to comply with [!DNL Salesforce Pardot] requirements.
>However, as a recommendation, when creating a segment, do not include whitespace or special characters in the segment name. Instead, use the underscore `(_)` character as a separator. For example instead of naming your segment as `Salesforce Pardot Segment 1` use `Salesforce_Pardot_Segment_1`.

### Prerequisites in [!DNL Salesforce Pardot] {#prerequisites-destination}

Note the following prerequisites in order to export data from Platform to your [!DNL Salesforce Pardot] account:

#### You need to have a [!DNL Salesforce Pardot] account {#prerequisites-account}

A [!DNL Salesforce Pardot] account with a subscription to the [Marketing Cloud Account Engagement](https://www.salesforce.com/products/marketing-cloud/marketing-automation/) product is mandatory to proceed.

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>Your account should also have the [Account Engagement Administrator role](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.pardot_fields_create_custom_field.htm&type=5) and the [!DNL Salesforce] admin must give permissions to the [!DNL Account Engagement admin] user that allow access to [!DNL Account Engagement Lightning App].

Reach out to [[!DNL Salesforce] Support](https://www.salesforce.com/company/contact-us/?d=cta-glob-footer-10) or your [!DNL Salesforce] account administrator if you do not have an account, or the account is missing the [!DNL Marketing Cloud Account Engagement] subscription or the [!DNL Account Engagement Administrator role].

#### Configure a connected app within [!DNL Salesforce] {#prerequisites-connected-app}

You can follow the [!DNL Salesforce] documentation [here](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.pardot_sf_connector_setup_v2_parent.htm&type=5) or alternatively check the steps below.

First, you need to configure a [[!DNL Salesforce] connected app](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.connected_app_create.htm&language=en_US&r=https%3A%2F%2Fhelp.salesforce.com%2F&type=5) within your [!DNL Salesforce] account, if you do not have one already. [!DNL Salesforce Pardot] will leverage the connected app to connect to [!DNL Salesforce].

Next, follow the [[!DNL Configure the Connected App for the OAuth 2.0 Client Credentials Flow]](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.connected_app_client_credentials_setup.htm&type=5) documentation so that the access token communication between [!DNL Salesforce Pardot] destination and [!DNL Salesforce] can be setup.

Now, follow the [!DNL Configure the Connector User](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.pardot_sf_connector_setup_connector_user_parent.htm&type=5) tutorial and its subsections to [!DNL Assign the Connector User Permission Set](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.pardot_sf_connector_setup_prepare_connector_user.htm&language=en_US&type=5) and the [!DNL Assign Object Permissions to the Connector User](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.pardot_sf_connector_setup_add_connector_permissions.htm&language=en_US&type=5) to ensure your user account has the correct permissions.

Also, ensure that the [scopes](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=connected_app_create_api_integration.htm&type=5&language=en_US) mentioned below are selected for the [!DNL Salesforce connected app].

1. In the **[!UICONTROL Mapping]** step, select **[!UICONTROL Add new mapping]**. You will see a new mapping row on the screen.
1. In the **[!UICONTROL Select source field]** window, choose the **[!UICONTROL Select attributes]** category and select the XDM attribute or choose the **[!UICONTROL Select identity namespace]** and select an identity.
1. In the **[!UICONTROL Select target field]** window, choose the **[!UICONTROL Select identity namespace]** and select an identity or choose **[!UICONTROL Select custom attributes]** category and specify from the [!DNL Salesforce Pardot API](https://pi.pardot.com/api/v5/objects/prospects/do/upsertLatestByEmail) the required attribute name.

    * Repeat these steps to add any additional mappings between your XDM profile schema and [!DNL Salesforce Pardot]:
        |Source Field|Target Field| Mandatory|
        |---|---|---|
        |`IdentityMap: Email`|`Identity: email`| `Mandatory` |

    * An example with the above mapping is shown below:
