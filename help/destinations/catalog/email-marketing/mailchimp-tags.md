# [!DNL Mailchimp Tags] connection

[[!DNL Mailchimp]](https://mailchimp.com) *(also known as [!DNL Intuit Mailchimp])* is a popular marketing automation platform and email marketing service used by businesses to manage and talk to contacts *(clients, customers, or other interested parties)* using mailing lists and email marketing campaigns.

[!DNL Mailchimp Tags] uses [audiences](https://mailchimp.com/help/getting-started-audience/) and [tags](https://mailchimp.com/help/getting-started-tags/) to manage your contact information. Tags are labels using which you can organize your contacts and label them for your internal categorization within [!DNL Mailchimp].

This [!DNL Adobe Experience Platform] [destination](/help/destinations/home.md) leverages the [[!DNL Mailchimp Batch subscribe or unsubscribe API]](https://mailchimp.com/developer/marketing/api/lists/batch-subscribe-or-unsubscribe/) endpoint. You can add contacts or update tags of existing [!DNL Mailchimp] contacts within an existing [!DNL Mailchimp] audience after activating them within a new segment. [!DNL Mailchimp Tags] uses the selected segment names from Platform as the tag names within [!DNL Mailchimp].

[!DNL Mailchimp Tags] uses [OAuth 2 with Authorization Code](/help/destinations/destination-sdk/functionality/authentication/oauth2-authentication.md#authorization-code) to communicate with the [!DNL Account Engagement] API. Instructions to authenticate to your [!DNL Mailchimp Tags] instance are further below, in the [Authenticate to destination](#authenticate) section.

    | Source Field | Target Field | Mandatory |
    | --- | --- | --- |
    |`IdentityMap: Email`|`Identity: email`| Yes |
