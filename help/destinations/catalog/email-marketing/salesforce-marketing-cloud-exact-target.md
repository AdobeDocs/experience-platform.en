# [!DNL (API) Salesforce Marketing Cloud] connection

## Overview {#overview}

[[!DNL Salesforce Marketing Cloud]](https://www.salesforce.com/products/marketing-cloud/overview/) (formerly known as [!DNL ExactTarget]) is a digital marketing suite that allows you to build and customize journeys for visitors and customers to personalize their experience.

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>Note the difference between this connection and the other [[!DNL Salesforce Marketing Cloud] connection](/help/destinations/catalog/email-marketing/salesforce-marketing-cloud.md) that exists within the Email marketing catalog section. The other Salesforce Marketing Cloud connection allows you to export files to a specified storage location, whereas this is an API-based streaming connection.

This [!DNL Adobe Experience Platform] [destination](/help/destinations/home.md) leverages the [!DNL Salesforce Marketing Cloud] [update contacts](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/marketing/marketing-cloud/guide/updateContacts.html) API, which allows you to add contacts / update contact data for your business needs after activating them within a new [!DNL Salesforce Marketing Cloud] segment.

[!DNL Salesforce Marketing Cloud] uses OAuth 2 with Client Credentials as the authentication mechanism to communicate with the [!DNL Salesforce Marketing Cloud] API. Instructions to authenticate to your [!DNL Salesforce Marketing Cloud] instance are further below, in the [Authenticate to destination](#authenticate) section.

## Use cases {#use-cases}

To help you better understand how and when you should use the [!DNL Salesforce Marketing Cloud] destination, here is a sample use case that Adobe Experience Platform customers can solve by using this destination.

### Send emails to contacts for marketing campaigns {#use-case-send-emails}

The sales department of a home rental platform wants to broadcast a marketing email to a targeted customer audience. The platform's marketing team can add new contacts / update existing contacts *(and their email addresses)* through Adobe Experience Platform, build segments from their own offline data, and send these segments to [!DNL Salesforce Marketing Cloud], which can then be used to send the marketing campaign email.

## Prerequisites {#prerequisites}

### Prerequisites in Experience Platform {#prerequisites-in-experience-platform}

Before activating data to the [!DNL Salesforce Marketing Cloud] destination, you must have a [schema](/help/xdm/schema/composition.md), a [dataset](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/platform-learn/tutorials/data-ingestion/create-datasets-and-ingest-data.html?lang=en), and [segments](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/platform-learn/tutorials/segments/create-segments.html?lang=en) created in [!DNL Experience Platform].

### Prerequisites in [!DNL Salesforce Marketing Cloud] {#prerequisites-destination}

Note the following prerequisites in order to export data from Platform to your [!DNL Salesforce Marketing Cloud] account:

#### You need to have a [!DNL Salesforce Marketing Cloud] account {#prerequisites-account}

Reach out to your [!DNL Salesforce Account Executive] to subscribe to the [!DNL Salesforce Marketing Cloud Account Engagement] product if you do not have it already.

#### Create custom field within [!DNL Salesforce Marketing Cloud] {#prerequisites-custom-field}

You must create a custom attribute of the type `Text Area Long`, which Experience Platform will use to update the segment status within [!DNL Salesforce Marketing Cloud]. In the workflow to activate segments to the destination, in the **[Segment schedule](#schedule-segment-export-example)** step, you will use the custom attribute as **[!UICONTROL Mapping ID]** for each segment you activate.

Refer to the [!DNL Salesforce Marketing Cloud] documentation to [create custom fields](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=mc_cab_create_an_attribute.htm&type=5&language=en_US) if you need additional guidance.

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
> Ensure you create the custom attribute under the `Email Demographics` attribute-set within your [!DNL Salesforce Marketing Cloud] account.

Refer to the Adobe Experience Platform documentation for [Segment Membership Details schema field group](/help/xdm/field-groups/profile/segmentation.md) if you need guidance on segment statuses.

>To activate data, you need the **[!UICONTROL Manage Destinations]**, **[!UICONTROL Activate Destinations]**, **[!UICONTROL View Profiles]**, and **[!UICONTROL View Segments]** [access control permissions](/help/access-control/home.md#permissions). Read the [access control overview](/help/access-control/ui/overview.md) or contact your product administrator to obtain the required permissions.

Read [Activate profiles and segments to streaming segment export destinations](/help/destinations/ui/activate-segment-streaming-destinations.md) for instructions on activating audience segments to this destination.

### Mapping considerations and example {#mapping-considerations-example}

To correctly send your audience data from Adobe Experience Platform to the [!DNL Salesforce Marketing Cloud] destination, you need to go through the field mapping step. Mapping consists of creating a link between your Experience Data Model (XDM) schema fields in your Platform account and their corresponding equivalents from the target destination. To correctly map your XDM fields to the [!DNL Salesforce Marketing Cloud] destination fields, follow the steps below.

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>Although your attribute names would be as per your [!DNL Salesforce Marketing Cloud] account, the mappings for both `contactKey` and `personalEmail.address` are mandatory.

1. In the **[!UICONTROL Mapping]** step, select **[!UICONTROL Add new mapping]**. You will see a new mapping row on the screen.
![Platform UI screenshot example for Add new mapping.](../../assets/catalog/email-marketing/salesforce-marketing-cloud-exact-target/add-new-mapping.png)

1. In the **[!UICONTROL Select source field]** window, choose the **[!UICONTROL Select attributes]** category and select `contactKey`.
![Platform UI screenshot example for Source mapping.](../../assets/catalog/email-marketing/salesforce-marketing-cloud-exact-target/source-mapping.png)

1. In the **[!UICONTROL Select target field]** window, select the type of target field that you want to map your source field to.
    * **[!UICONTROL Select identity namespace]**: select this option to map your source field to an identity namespace from the list.
    ![Platform UI screenshot showing Target mapping for salesforceContactKey.](../../assets/catalog/email-marketing/salesforce-marketing-cloud-exact-target/target-mapping.png)

    * Add the following mapping between your XDM profile schema and your [!DNL Salesforce Marketing Cloud] instance:
        |XDM Profile Schema|[!DNL Salesforce Marketing Cloud] Instance| Mandatory|
        |---|---|---|
        |`contactKey`|`salesforceContactKey`| Yes |

    * **[!UICONTROL Select custom attributes]**: select this option to map your source field to a custom attribute that you define in the **[!UICONTROL Attribute name]** field. Refer to [!DNL Salesforce Marketing Cloud] [documentation](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/marketing/marketing-cloud/guide/updateContacts.html) for a list of supported attributes. Also note that the destination uses the [Salesforce Search Attribute-Set Definitions REST API](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/marketing/marketing-cloud/guide/retrieveAttributeSetDefinitions.html) to retrieve attributes defined within Salesforce for your contacts and specific to your account.
    ![Platform UI screenshot showing Target mapping.](../../assets/catalog/email-marketing/salesforce-marketing-cloud-exact-target/target-mapping-custom.png)

    * For instance, depending on the values you want to update, add the following mapping between your XDM profile schema and your [!DNL Salesforce Marketing Cloud] instance:
        |XDM Profile Schema|[!DNL Salesforce Marketing Cloud] Instance|
        |---|---|
        |`person.name.firstName`|`Email Demographics.First Name`|
        |`personalEmail.address`|`Email Addresses.Email Address`|

    * An example using these mappings is shown below:
    ![Platform UI screenshot example showing Target mappings.](../../assets/catalog/email-marketing/salesforce-marketing-cloud-exact-target/mappings.png)

### Schedule segment export and example {#schedule-segment-export-example}

When performing the [Schedule segment export](/help/destinations/ui/activate-segment-streaming-destinations.md#scheduling) step, you must manually map Platform segments to the [custom attribute](#prerequisites-custom-field) in Salesforce.

To do this, select each segment, then enter the corresponding custom attribute from Salesforce in the **[!UICONTROL Mapping ID]** field.

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>The value used for the Mapping ID should exactly match the name of the custom attribute created within Salesforce under the "Email Demographics" attribute-set.

An example is shown below:
![Platform UI screenshot example showing Schedule segment export.](../../assets/catalog/email-marketing/salesforce-marketing-cloud-exact-target/schedule-segment-export.png)

## Validate data export {#exported-data}

To validate that you have correctly set up the destination, follow the steps below:

1. Select **[!UICONTROL Destinations]** > **[!UICONTROL Browse]** to navigate to the list of destinations.
![Platform UI screenshot showing Browse Destinations.](../../assets/catalog/email-marketing/salesforce-marketing-cloud-exact-target/browse-destinations.png)

1. Select the destination and validate that the status is **[!UICONTROL enabled]**.
![Platform UI screenshot showing Destinations Dataflow Run.](../../assets/catalog/email-marketing/salesforce-marketing-cloud-exact-target/destination-dataflow-run.png)

![Platform UI screenshot example showing Destinations Activation Data.](../../assets/catalog/email-marketing/salesforce-marketing-cloud-exact-target/destinations-activation-data.png)

1. Monitor the segment summary and ensure that the count of profiles corresponds to the count created within the segment.
![Platform UI screenshot example showing Segment.](../../assets/catalog/email-marketing/salesforce-marketing-cloud-exact-target/segment.png)

1. Log in to the [!DNL Salesforce Marketing Cloud](https://mc.exacttarget.com/) website. Then navigate to the **[!DNL Audience Builder]** > **[!DNL Contact Builder]** > **[!DNL All contacts]** > **[!DNL Email]** page and check if the profiles from the segment have been added.
![Salesforce Marketing Cloud UI screenshot showing the Contacts page with profiles used in the segment.](../../assets/catalog/email-marketing/salesforce-marketing-cloud-exact-target/contacts.png)

1. To check if any profiles have been updated, navigate to the **[!DNL Email]** page and verify if the attribute values for the profile from the segment have been updated. If successful you can see that each segment status in [!Salesforce Marketing Cloud] was updated with the corresponding segment status from Platform, based on the **[!UICONTROL Mapping ID]** value provided during the [segment scheduling](#schedule-segment-export-example) step.
![Salesforce Marketing Cloud UI screenshot showing the selected Contacts Email page with updated segment statuses.](../../assets/catalog/email-marketing/salesforce-marketing-cloud-exact-target/contact-detail.png)
