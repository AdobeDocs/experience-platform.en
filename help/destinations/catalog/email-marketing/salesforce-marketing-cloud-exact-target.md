# [!DNL (API) Salesforce Marketing Cloud] connection

## Overview {#overview}

[[!DNL (API) Salesforce Marketing Cloud]](https://www.salesforce.com/products/marketing-cloud/engagement/) (formerly known as [!DNL ExactTarget]) is a digital marketing suite that allows you to build and customize journeys for visitors and customers to personalize their experience.

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
> Note the difference between this connection and the other [[!DNL Salesforce Marketing Cloud] connection](/help/destinations/catalog/email-marketing/salesforce-marketing-cloud.md) that exists within the Email marketing catalog section. The other Salesforce Marketing Cloud connection allows you to export files to a specified storage location, whereas this is an API-based streaming connection.

Compared to [!DNL Salesforce Marketing Cloud Account Engagement] which is more oriented towards **B2B** marketing, the [!DNL (API) Salesforce Marketing Cloud] destination is ideal for **B2C** use cases with shorter transactional decision-making cycles. You can consolidate larger datasets representing your target audience's behavior to adjust and improve marketing campaigns by prioritizing and segmenting contacts, especially from datasets outside [!DNL Salesforce]. *Note, Experience Platform also has a connection for the [[!DNL Salesforce Marketing Cloud Account Engagement]](/help/destinations/catalog/email-marketing/salesforce-marketing-cloud-account-engagement.md).*

This [!DNL Adobe Experience Platform] [destination](/help/destinations/home.md) uses the [!DNL Salesforce Marketing Cloud] [update contacts](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/marketing/marketing-cloud/guide/updateContacts.html) API, which allows you to **add contacts and update contact data** for your business needs after activating them within a new [!DNL Salesforce Marketing Cloud] segment.

[!DNL Salesforce Marketing Cloud] uses OAuth 2 with Client Credentials as the authentication mechanism to communicate with the [!DNL Salesforce Marketing Cloud] API. Instructions to authenticate to your [!DNL Salesforce Marketing Cloud] instance are further below, in the [Authenticate to destination](#authenticate) section.

## Use cases {#use-cases}

To help you better understand how and when you should use the [!DNL (API) Salesforce Marketing Cloud] destination, here is a sample use case that Adobe Experience Platform customers can solve by using this destination.

### Send emails to contacts for marketing campaigns {#use-case-send-emails}

The sales department of a home rental platform wants to broadcast a marketing email to a targeted customer audience. The platform's marketing team can add new contacts / update existing contacts *(and their email addresses)* through Adobe Experience Platform, build audiences from their own offline data, and send these audiences to [!DNL Salesforce Marketing Cloud], which can then be used to send the marketing campaign email.

## Prerequisites {#prerequisites}

### Prerequisites in Experience Platform {#prerequisites-in-experience-platform}

Before activating data to the [!DNL (API) Salesforce Marketing Cloud] destination, you must have a [schema](/help/xdm/schema/composition.md), a [dataset](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/platform-learn/tutorials/data-ingestion/create-datasets-and-ingest-data.html), and [segments](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/platform-learn/tutorials/segments/create-segments.html) created in [!DNL Experience Platform].

### Prerequisites in [!DNL (API) Salesforce Marketing Cloud] {#prerequisites-destination}

Note the following prerequisites in order to export data from Platform to your [!DNL Salesforce Marketing Cloud] account:

#### You need to have a [!DNL Salesforce Marketing Cloud] account {#prerequisites-account}

A [!DNL Salesforce Marketing Cloud] account with a subscription to the [[!DNL Marketing Cloud Engagement]](https://www.salesforce.com/products/marketing-cloud/engagement/) product is mandatory to proceed.

Reach out to [[!DNL Salesforce] Support](https://www.salesforce.com/company/contact-us/?d=cta-glob-footer-10) if you do not have a [!DNL Salesforce Marketing Cloud] account or your account is missing the [!DNL Marketing Cloud Engagement] product subscription.

#### Create attributes within [!DNL Salesforce Marketing Cloud] {#prerequisites-attribute}

When activating audiences to the [!DNL (API) Salesforce Marketing Cloud] destination, you must input a value in the **[!UICONTROL Mapping ID]** field for each activated audience, in the **[Audience schedule](#schedule-segment-export-example)** step.

[!DNL Salesforce] requires this value to correctly read and interpret audiences coming in from Experience Platform and to update their audience status within [!DNL Salesforce Marketing Cloud]. Refer to the Experience Platform documentation for [Audience Membership Details schema field group](/help/xdm/field-groups/profile/segmentation.md) if you need guidance on audience statuses.

For each audience that you activate from Platform to [!DNL Salesforce], you must have an attribute of type `Text` linked to the [!DNL Email Demographics] data extension within [!DNL Salesforce Marketing Cloud]. Use the [!DNL Salesforce Marketing Cloud] [!DNL Contact Builder] to create attributes. Refer to the [!DNL Salesforce Marketing Cloud] documentation to [create attributes](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=mc_cab_create_an_attribute.htm&type=5&language=en_US) if you need guidance on creating attributes.

The attribute field names are used for the [!DNL (API) Salesforce Marketing Cloud] target field during the **[!UICONTROL Mapping]** step. You can define the field character with a maximum of 4000 characters, according to your business requirement. See the [!DNL Salesforce Marketing Cloud] [Data Extensions Data Types](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.mc_es_data_extension_data_types.htm&type=5) documentation page for additional information on attribute types.

An example of the data designer screen in [!DNL Salesforce Marketing Cloud], into which you will add the attribute is shown below:
![Salesforce Marketing Cloud UI data designer.](../../assets/catalog/email-marketing/salesforce-marketing-cloud-exact-target/salesforce-data-designer.png)

A view of a [!DNL Salesforce Marketing Cloud] [!DNL Email Data] attribute group with attributes corresponding to the audience status within the [!DNL Email Demographics] data extension is shown below:
![Salesforce Marketing Cloud UI email data attribute group.](../../assets/catalog/email-marketing/salesforce-marketing-cloud-exact-target/salesforce-email-demographics-fields.png)

The [!DNL (API) Salesforce Marketing Cloud] destination uses the [!DNL Salesforce Marketing Cloud] [!DNL Search Attribute-Set Definitions REST] [API](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/marketing/marketing-cloud/guide/retrieveAttributeSetDefinitions.html) to dynamically retrieve the data extensions and their linked attributes' defined within [!DNL Salesforce Marketing Cloud].

These are displayed in the **[!UICONTROL Target field]** selection window when you set up the [mapping](#mapping-considerations-example) in the workflow to [activate audiences to the destination](#activate).

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
> Within [!DNL Salesforce Marketing Cloud], you must create attributes with a **[!UICONTROL FIELD NAME]** that exactly matches the value specified within **[!UICONTROL Mapping ID]** for each activated Platform segment. For example, the screenshot below shows an attribute named `salesforce_mc_segment_1`. When activating an audience to this destination, add `salesforce_mc_segment_1` as **[!UICONTROL Mapping ID]** to populate audience audiences from Experience Platform into this attribute.

An example of attribute creation in [!DNL Salesforce Marketing Cloud], is shown below:
![Salesforce Marketing Cloud UI screenshot showing an attribute.](../../assets/catalog/email-marketing/salesforce-marketing-cloud-exact-target/salesforce-custom-field.png)

>[!TIP]
>
> * When creating the attribute, do not include whitespace characters in the field name. Instead, use the underscore `(_)` character as a separator.
> * To distinguish between attributes used for Platform audiences and other attributes within [!DNL Salesforce Marketing Cloud], you could include a recognizable prefix or suffix for the attributes used for Adobe segments. For example, instead of `test_segment`, use `Adobe_test_segment` or `test_segment_Adobe`.
> * If you already have other attributes created in [!DNL Salesforce Marketing Cloud], you can use the same name as the Platform segment, to easily identify the audience in [!DNL Salesforce Marketing Cloud].

#### Assign user roles and permissions within [!DNL Salesforce Marketing Cloud] {#prerequisites-roles-permissions}

As [!DNL Salesforce Marketing Cloud] supports custom roles depending on your use-case, your user should be assigned the relevant roles to update your attributes within [!DNL Salesforce Marketing Cloud]. An example of roles assigned to a user is shown below:
![Salesforce Marketing Cloud UI for a selected user which shows their assigned roles.](../../assets/catalog/email-marketing/salesforce-marketing-cloud-exact-target/salesforce-edit-roles.png)

Depending on which roles your [!DNL Salesforce Marketing Cloud] user has been assigned, you would also need to assign permissions to the [!DNL Salesforce Marketing Cloud] data extension which are linked to the fields you are looking to update. 

As this destination requires access to the `[!DNL data extension]`, you need to allow them. For Example for the `Email` [!DNL data extension] you need to allow as shown below:

![Salesforce Marketing Cloud UI showing the email data extension with allowed permissions.](../../assets/catalog/email-marketing/salesforce-marketing-cloud-exact-target/salesforce-permisions-list.png)

To restrict the level of access, you can also override individual access by using granular privileges.
![Salesforce Marketing Cloud UI showing the email data extension with granular permissions.](../../assets/catalog/email-marketing/salesforce-marketing-cloud-exact-target/sales-email-attribute-set-permission.png)

Refer to the [[!DNL Marketing Cloud Roles]](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?language=en_US&id=sf.mc_overview_marketing_cloud_roles.htm&type=5) and [[!DNL Marketing Cloud Roles and Permissions]](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?language=en_US&id=sf.mc_overview_roles.htm&type=5) pages for detailed guidance.

Read [Activate profiles and audiences to streaming audience export destinations](/help/destinations/ui/activate-segment-streaming-destinations.md) for instructions on activating audiences to this destination.

### Mapping considerations and example {#mapping-considerations-example}

To correctly send your audience data from Adobe Experience Platform to the [!DNL (API) Salesforce Marketing Cloud] destination, you need to go through the field mapping step. Mapping consists of creating a link between your Experience Data Model (XDM) schema fields in your Platform account and their corresponding equivalents from the target destination. 

To correctly map your XDM fields to the [!DNL (API) Salesforce Marketing Cloud] destination fields, follow the steps below.

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
> * Although your attribute names would be as per your [!DNL Salesforce Marketing Cloud] account, the mappings for both `contactKey` and `personalEmail.address` are mandatory.
>
> * The integration with the [!DNL Salesforce Marketing Cloud] API is subject to a pagination limit of how many attributes Experience Platform can retrieve from Salesforce. This means during the **[!UICONTROL Mapping]** step, the target field schema can display a maximum of 2000 attributes from your Salesforce account.

1. In the **[!UICONTROL Mapping]** step, select **[!UICONTROL Add new mapping]**. You will see a new mapping row on the screen.
![Platform UI screenshot example for Add new mapping.](../../assets/catalog/email-marketing/salesforce-marketing-cloud-exact-target/add-new-mapping.png)
1. In the **[!UICONTROL Select source field]** window, choose the **[!UICONTROL Select attributes]** category and select the XDM attribute or choose the **[!UICONTROL Select identity namespace]** and select an identity.
1. In the **[!UICONTROL Select target field]** window, choose the **[!UICONTROL Select identity namespace]** and select an identity or choose **[!UICONTROL Select attributes]** category and select an attribute from the data extensions displayed as needed. The [!DNL (API) Salesforce Marketing Cloud] destination uses the [!DNL Salesforce Marketing Cloud] [!DNL Search Attribute-Set Definitions REST] [API](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/marketing/marketing-cloud/guide/retrieveAttributeSetDefinitions.html) to dynamically retrieve the data extensions and their linked attributes' defined within [!DNL Salesforce Marketing Cloud]. These are displayed in the **[!UICONTROL Target field]** popup when you set up the [mapping](#mapping-considerations-example) in the [activate audiences workflow](#activate). 

    * Repeat these steps to add the following mappings between your XDM profile schema and [!DNL (API) Salesforce Marketing Cloud]:
    
        |Source Field|Target Field| Mandatory|
        |---|---|---|
        |`IdentityMap: contactKey`|`Identity: salesforceContactKey`| `Mandatory` |
        |`xdm: personalEmail.address`|`Attribute: Email Address` from the [!DNL Salesforce Marketing Cloud] [!DNL Email Addresses] data extension. | `Mandatory`, when adding new contacts. |
        |`xdm: person.name.firstName`|`Attribute: First Name` from the desired [!DNL Salesforce Marketing Cloud] data extension.| - |

    * An example using these mappings is shown below:
    ![Platform UI screenshot example showing Target mappings.](../../assets/catalog/email-marketing/salesforce-marketing-cloud-exact-target/mappings.png)

When you have finished providing the mappings for your destination connection, select **[!UICONTROL Next]**.

### Schedule audience export and example {#schedule-segment-export-example}

When performing the [Schedule audience export](/help/destinations/ui/activate-segment-streaming-destinations.md#scheduling) step, you must manually map Platform audiences to the [attributes](#prerequisites-attribute) in [!DNL Salesforce Marketing Cloud].

To do this, select each segment, then enter name of the attribute from [!DNL Salesforce Marketing Cloud] in the [!DNL (API) Salesforce Marketing Cloud] **[!UICONTROL Mapping ID]** field. Refer to the [Create attribute within [!DNL Salesforce Marketing Cloud]](#prerequisites-custom-field) section for guidance and best practices on creating attributes in [!DNL Salesforce Marketing Cloud].

For example, if your [!DNL Salesforce Marketing Cloud] attribute is `salesforce_mc_segment_1`, specify this value in the [!DNL (API) Salesforce Marketing Cloud] **[!UICONTROL Mapping ID]** to populate audience audiences from Experience Platform into this attribute.

An example attribute from [!DNL Salesforce Marketing Cloud] is shown below:
![Salesforce Marketing Cloud UI screenshot showing an attribute.](../../assets/catalog/email-marketing/salesforce-marketing-cloud-exact-target/salesforce-custom-field.png)

An example indicating the location of the [!DNL (API) Salesforce Marketing Cloud] **[!UICONTROL Mapping ID]** is shown below:
![Platform UI screenshot example showing Schedule audience export.](../../assets/catalog/email-marketing/salesforce-marketing-cloud-exact-target/schedule-segment-export.png)

As shown the [!DNL (API) Salesforce Marketing Cloud] **[!UICONTROL Mapping ID]** should exactly match the value specified within [!DNL Salesforce Marketing Cloud] **[!UICONTROL FIELD NAME]**.

Repeat this section for each activated Platform segment.

A typical example based on the image shown above could be.
| [!DNL (API) Salesforce Marketing Cloud] segment name | [!DNL Salesforce Marketing Cloud] **[!UICONTROL FIELD NAME]** | [!DNL (API) Salesforce Marketing Cloud] **[!UICONTROL Mapping ID]** | 
| --- | --- | --- |
| salesforce mc audience 1 | `salesforce_mc_segment_1` | `salesforce_mc_segment_1` |
| salesforce mc audience 2 | `salesforce_mc_segment_2` | `salesforce_mc_segment_2` |

## Validate data export {#exported-data}

To validate that you have correctly set up the destination, follow the steps below:

1. Select **[!UICONTROL Destinations]** > **[!UICONTROL Browse]** to navigate to the list of destinations.
![Platform UI screenshot showing Browse Destinations.](../../assets/catalog/email-marketing/salesforce-marketing-cloud-exact-target/browse-destinations.png)

1. Select the destination and validate that the status is **[!UICONTROL enabled]**.
![Platform UI screenshot showing Destinations Dataflow Run.](../../assets/catalog/email-marketing/salesforce-marketing-cloud-exact-target/destination-dataflow-run.png)

1. Switch to the **[!DNL Activation data]** tab, then select an audience name.
![Platform UI screenshot example showing Destinations Activation Data.](../../assets/catalog/email-marketing/salesforce-marketing-cloud-exact-target/destinations-activation-data.png)

1. Monitor the audience summary and ensure that the count of profiles corresponds to the count created within the segment.
![Platform UI screenshot example showing Segment.](../../assets/catalog/email-marketing/salesforce-marketing-cloud-exact-target/segment.png)

1. Log in to the [[!DNL Salesforce Marketing Cloud]](https://mc.exacttarget.com/) website. Then navigate to the **[!DNL Audience Builder]** > **[!DNL Contact Builder]** > **[!DNL All contacts]** > **[!DNL Email]** page and check if the profiles from the audience have been added.
![Salesforce Marketing Cloud UI screenshot showing the Contacts page with profiles used in the segment.](../../assets/catalog/email-marketing/salesforce-marketing-cloud-exact-target/contacts.png)

1. To check if any profiles have been updated, navigate to the **[!UICONTROL Email]** page and verify if the attribute values for the profile from the audience have been updated. If successful, you can see that each audience status in [!DNL Salesforce Marketing Cloud] was updated with the corresponding audience status from Platform, based on the **[!UICONTROL Mapping ID]** value provided in the [audience scheduling](#schedule-segment-export-example) step.
![Salesforce Marketing Cloud UI screenshot showing the selected Contacts Email page with updated audience statuses.](../../assets/catalog/email-marketing/salesforce-marketing-cloud-exact-target/contact-detail.png)
