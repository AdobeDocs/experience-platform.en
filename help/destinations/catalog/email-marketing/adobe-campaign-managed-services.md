# Adobe Campaign Managed Cloud Services connection {#adobe-campaign-managed-services}

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>This integration works with [Adobe Campaign version 8.4 or higher](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/campaign/campaign-v8/new/release-notes.html?lang=en#release-8-4-1).

## Overview {#overview}

Adobe Campaign Managed Cloud Services provides a platform for designing cross-channel customer experiences and an environment for visual campaign orchestration, real-time interaction management and cross channel execution. [Get Started with Campaign](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/campaign/campaign-v8/start/get-started.html)

Use Campaign to:
* Drive personalization and engagement through a single accessible view of the customer,
* Integrate email, mobile, online and offline channels into the customer journey,
* Automate the delivery of meaningful and timely messages and offers.

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>Keep in mind the following guardrails when using the Adobe Campaign Managed Cloud Services connection:
>
>* A maximum of 50 segments can be [activated](#activate) for the destination,
>* For each segment, you can add up to 20 fields to [map](#map) to Adobe Campaign,
>* Data retention on Azure Blob storage Data Landing Zone (DLZ) : 7 day,
>* The activation frequency is 3 hours minimum.

## Use cases {#use-cases}

To help you better understand how and when you should use the Adobe Campaign Manage Service destination, here is a sample use case that Adobe Experience Platform customers can solve by using this destination.

* Adobe Experience Platform creates a customer profile that incorporates information like the identity graph, behavioral data from analytics, merges offline and online data etc. With this integration, you can augment the segmentation capabilities that are already existing within Adobe Campaign with those Adobe Experience Platform powered audiences, and you can hence activate that data in Campaign.

  For example, a sports attire company wants to leverage the Adobe Experience Platform powered smart segments and activate them using Adobe Campaign to reach out to their customer base across the different channels supported by Adobe Campaign. Once the messages are sent, they want to enhance the customer profile in Adobe Experience platform with experience data from Adobe Campaign such as sends, open and clicks.

  The result is cross channel campaigns that are more consistent across the Adobe Experience cloud ecosystem and a rich customer profile that is quickly adapting and learning.


* In addition to segment activation in Campaign, you can leverage the Adobe Campaign Managed Services destination to bring in additional profile attributes which are tied to a profile on Adobe Experience Platform and have a sync process in place so that they are updated in the Adobe Campaign database. 

  For example, let's say you are capturing opt-in and opt-out values in Adobe Experience Platform. With this connection, you can bring over these values into Adobe Campaign and have a sync process in place so that they are updated on a regular basis.

  >[!NOTE]
  >
  >Profile attributes sync is available for profiles that are already present in the Adobe Campaign database.

## Supported identities {#supported-identities}

*Adobe Campaign Managed Cloud Services* supports the activation of identities described in the table below. Learn more about [identities](/help/identity-service/namespaces.md).

|Target Identity|Description|Considerations|
|---|---|---|
|external_id|Custom user IDs|Select this target identity when your source identity is a custom namespace. We recommend using this identity and mapping it to the ID in your Campaign instance that represents customer (loyalty_ID, account_ID, customer_ID...)|
|ECID|Experience Cloud ID|A namespace that represents ECID. This namespace can also be referred to by the following aliases: "Adobe Marketing Cloud ID", "Adobe Experience Cloud ID", "Adobe Experience Platform ID". See the following document on [ECID](/help/identity-service/ecid.md) for more information.|
|email_lc_sha256|Email addresses hashed with the SHA256 algorithm|Both plain text and SHA256 hashed email addresses are supported by Adobe Experience Platform. When your source field contains unhashed attributes, check the **[!UICONTROL Apply transformation]** option, to have [!DNL Platform] automatically hash the data on activation.|
|phone_sha256|Phone numbers hashed with the SHA256 algorithm|Both plain text and SHA256 hashed phone numbers are supported by Adobe Experience Platform. When your source field contains unhashed attributes, check the **[!UICONTROL Apply transformation]** option, to have [!DNL Platform] automatically hash the data on activation.|
|GAID|Google Advertising ID|Select the GAID target identity when your source identity is a GAID namespace.|
|IDFA|Apple ID for Advertisers|Select the IDFA target identity when your source identity is an IDFA namespace.|

## Activate segments to this destination {#activate}

>[!IMPORTANT]
> 
>To activate data, you need the **[!UICONTROL Manage Destinations]**, **[!UICONTROL Activate Destinations]**, **[!UICONTROL View Profiles]**, and **[!UICONTROL View Segments]** [access control permissions](/help/access-control/home.md#permissions). Read the [access control overview](/help/access-control/ui/overview.md) or contact your product administrator to obtain the required permissions.

Read [Activate audience data to batch profile export destinations](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-platform/destinations/ui/activate/activate-batch-profile-destinations.html) for instructions on activating audience data to this destination.

### Map attributes and identities {#map}

Select XDM fields to export with the profiles and map them to the corresponding Adobe Campaign fields.[Learn more on identity and attributes selection for email marketing destinations](overview.md)

1. Select source fields:

    * Select an **identifier** (For example: the email field) as source identity that uniquely identifies a profile in Adobe Experience Platform and Adobe Campaign.

    * Select all other **XDM source profile attributes** that need to be exported to Adobe Campaign.

    >[!NOTE]
    >
    >The "segmentMembershipStatus" field is a required mapping to reflect segmentMembership status. This field is added by default and cannot be modified or removed.

1. Map each field with its target field in Adobe Campaign. Available target fields are determined by the target mapping selected when [creating the destination](#destination-details).

1. Identify mandatory attributes and deduplication keys. Note that values in attributes marked as "Mandatory" or "Deduplication key" cannot be null.

    * [Mandatory attributes](../../ui/activate-batch-profile-destinations.md#mandatory-attributes) ensure that all profile records contain the selected attribute(s). For example: all exported profiles contain an email address. Recommendation is to set to mandatory both the identity field and the field used as deduplication key.
    * [A deduplication key](../../ui/activate-batch-profile-destinations.md#mandatory-attributes) is a primary key which determines the identity by which users want their profiles to be deduplicated.

      >[!IMPORTANT]
      >
      >Make sure that the deduplication key attribute's name matches a column name of the selected target mapping.

    ![](../../assets/catalog/email-marketing/adobe-campaign-managed-services/mapping.png)

1. Once mapping has been performed, you can review and complete the destination configuration to start sending data to **[!DNL Campaign]**.
