# [!DNL Outreach] connection

## Overview {#overview}

[Outreach](https://www.outreach.io/) is a Sales Execution Platform with the most B2B buyer-seller interaction data in the world and significant investments in proprietary AI technologies to translate sales data into intelligence, Outreach helps revenue organizations automate sales engagement and act on revenue intelligence to improve their efficiency, predictability, and growth.

This [!DNL Adobe Experience Platform] [destination](/help/destinations/home.md) leverages the [Outreach Update Resource API](https://api.outreach.io/api/v2/docs#update-an-existing-resource), which allows you to update identities within a segment corresponding to prospects in Outreach.

Outreach uses OAuth 2 with Authorization Grant as the authentication mechanism to communicate with the Outreach Update Resource API. Instructions to authenticate to your Outreach instance are further below, in the [Authenticate to destination](#authenticate) section.

## Use cases {#use-cases}

As a marketer, you can deliver personalized experiences to your prospects, based on attributes from their Adobe Experience Platform profiles. You can build segments from your offline data and send these segments to Outreach, to display in the prospectsâ€™ feeds as soon as segments and profiles are updated in Adobe Experience Platform.

## Prerequisites {#prerequisites}

### Prerequisites in Experience Platform {#prerequisites-in-experience-platform}

Before activating data to the Outreach destination, you must have a [schema](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-platform/xdm/schema/composition.html), a [dataset](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/platform-learn/tutorials/data-ingestion/create-datasets-and-ingest-data.html?lang=en), and [segments](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/platform-learn/tutorials/segments/create-segments.html?lang=en) created in [!DNL Experience Platform].

### Prerequisites in Outreach {#prerequisites-destination}

Note the following prerequisites in Outreach, in order to export data from Platform to your Outreach account:

#### You need to have an Outreach account {#prerequisites-account}

Go to the Outreach [sign in](https://accounts.outreach.io/users/sign_in) page to register and create an account, if you do not have one already. Also see support [page](https://support.outreach.io/hc/en-us/articles/207238607-Claim-Your-Outreach-Account).

Refer to Adobe's documentation for [Segment Membership Details schema field group](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-platform/xdm/field-groups/profile/segmentation.html?lang=en) if you need guidance on segment statuses.

#### Gather Outreach credentials {#gather-credentials}

Note down the items below before you authenticate to the Outreach CRM destination:

| Credential | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Email | Your Outreach account email |
| Password | Your Outreach account password |

#### Setup custom field labels

Outreach supports custom fields for [prospects](https://support.outreach.io/hc/en-us/articles/360001557554-Outreach-Prospect-Profile-Overview). Refer to [How To add a custom field in Outreach](https://support.outreach.io/hc/en-us/articles/219124908-How-To-Add-a-Custom-Field-in-Outreach) for additional guidance. For ease of identification it is recommended to manually update the label's to their corresponding segment names instead of keeping the defaults. For example as below:

Outreach settings page for prospects displaying custom fields.
![Outreach custom fields defaults](../../assets/catalog/crm/outreach/outreach-custom-fields.png)

Outreach settings page for prospects displaying custom fields with *user-friendly* labels matching to the segment names. You can view the segment status on the prospect page against these labels.
![Outreach custom fields with labels](../../assets/catalog/crm/outreach/outreach-custom-field-labels.png)

> [!NOTE]
>
> When updating prospects the label names are not used they are for ease of identification only.

## Supported identities {#supported-identities}

Outreach supports update of identities described in the table below. Learn more about [identities](/help/identity-service/namespaces.md).

|Target Identity|Description|Considerations|
|---|---|---|
| OutreachId |Custom Outreach identifier that supports mapping of any identity.|Mandatory. You can send any [identity](../../../identity-service/namespaces.md) to the [!DNL Outreach] destination, as long as you map it to the `OutreachId`. |

## Export type and frequency {#export-type-frequency}

Refer to the table below for information about the destination export type and frequency.

| Item | Type | Notes |
---------|----------|---------|
| Export type | **[!UICONTROL Profile-based]** | <ul><li>You are exporting all members of a segment, together with the desired schema fields *(for example: email address, phone number, last name)*, according to your field mapping.</li><li> Platform segment statuses are exported to [!DNL Outreach] by specifying their corresponding custom field attribute in [!DNL Outreach], within the **[!UICONTROL Activate Destination]** > **[!UICONTROL Schedule segment export]** > **[!UICONTROL Mapping ID]** field.</li></ul> |
| Export frequency | **[!UICONTROL Streaming]** | <ul><li>Streaming destinations are "always on" API-based connections. As soon as a profile is updated in Experience Platform based on segment evaluation, the connector sends the update downstream to the destination platform. Read more about [streaming destinations](/help/destinations/destination-types.md#streaming-destinations).</li></ul>|

### Mapping considerations and example {#mapping-considerations-example}

To correctly send your audience data from Adobe Experience Platform to the Outreach destination, you need to go through the field mapping step. Mapping consists of creating a link between your Experience Data Model (XDM) schema fields in your Platform account and their corresponding equivalents from the target destination. To correctly map your XDM fields to the Outreach destination fields, follow these steps:

1. In the Mapping step, click **[!UICONTROL Add new mapping]**, you will see a new mapping row on the screen.
![Add new mapping](../../assets/catalog/crm/outreach/add-new-mapping.png)

1. In the select source field window, when selecting the source field choose the **[!UICONTROL Select identity namespace]** category and add the mappings desired.
![Source mapping](../../assets/catalog/crm/outreach/source-mapping.png)

1. In the select target field window, select the target field and choose the **[!UICONTROL Select identity namespace]** category and add the mappings desired.
![Target mapping using contactId](../../assets/catalog/crm/outreach/target-mapping.png)

1. For custom attributes, in the select target field window, select the target field and choose the **[!UICONTROL Select custom attributes]** category, Next provide the desired target attribute name and add the mappings desired.
![Target mapping using LastName](../../assets/catalog/crm/outreach/target-mapping-lastname.png)

1. For instance, you could add the following mapping between your XDM profile schema and your [!DNL Outreach] instance:

    ||XDM Profile Schema|[!DNL Outreach] Instance| Mandatory|
    |---|---|---|---|
    |Attributes|<ul><li><code>person.name.firstName</code></li><li><code>person.name.lastName</code></li></ul>|<ul><li><code>firstName</code></li><li><code>lastName</code></li></ul>|
    |Identities|<ul><li><code>Oid</code></li></ul>|<ul><li><code>OutreachId</code></li></ul>|Yes|

1. An example using these mappings is shown below:
![Target mapping](../../assets/catalog/crm/outreach/mappings.png)

Refer to [Outreach prospect documentation](https://api.outreach.io/api/v2/docs#prospect) for a comprehensive list of supported attributes.

### Schedule segment export and example {#schedule-segment-export-example}

When performing the [Schedule segment export](../../ui/activate/activate-segment-streaming-destinations.html?lang=en#scheduling) step you must manually map Platform segments to the custom field attribute in Outreach.

To do this, select each segment, then enter the corresponding numeric value which corresponds to the *custom`N`* attribute from Outreach in the **[!UICONTROL Mapping ID]** field.

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> The numeric value *(`N`)* used within the Mapping ID should match the custom attribute key suffixed with the numeric value i.e. *custom`N`* within Outreach. A maximum of custom1 ... custom150 fields are supported within Outreach. Refer to [Outreach prospect documentation](https://api.outreach.io/api/v2/docs#prospect) for details.

An example is shown below:
![Schedule segment export](../../assets/catalog/crm/outreach/schedule-segment-export.png)

## Validate data export {#exported-data}

To validate that you have correctly set up the destination, follow the steps below:

1. Select **[!UICONTROL Destinations]** > **[!UICONTROL Browse]** to navigate to the list of destinations.
![Browse Destinations](../../assets/catalog/crm/outreach/browse-destinations.png)

1. Select the destination and validate that the status is **[!UICONTROL enabled]**.
![Destinations Dataflow Run](../../assets/catalog/crm/outreach/destination-dataflow-run.png)

1. Switch to the **[!DNL Activation data]** tab, then select a segment name.
![Destinations Activation Data](../../assets/catalog/crm/outreach/destinations-activation-data.png)

1. Monitor the segment summary and ensure that the count of profiles corresponds to the count created within the segment.
![Segment](../../assets/catalog/crm/outreach/segment.png)

1. Login to the Outreach website, then navigate to the **[!DNL Apps]** > **[!DNL Contacts]** page and check if the profiles from the segment have been added. You will also notice the segment status from Experience Platform has been updated against the corresponding custom field attribute *(identified through the friendly label name)* that was provided in the **Mapping ID** field during the **[!UICONTROL Activate destination]** > **[!UICONTROL Schedule segment export]** step.
