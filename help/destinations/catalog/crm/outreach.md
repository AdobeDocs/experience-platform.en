# [!DNL Outreach] connection

## Overview {#overview}

[[!DNL Outreach]](https://www.outreach.io/) is a Sales Execution Platform with the most B2B buyer-seller interaction data in the world and significant investments in proprietary AI technologies to translate sales data into intelligence. [!DNL Outreach] helps organizations automate sales engagement and act on revenue intelligence to improve their efficiency, predictability, and growth.

This [!DNL Adobe Experience Platform] [destination](/help/destinations/home.md) leverages the [Outreach Update Resource API](https://api.outreach.io/api/v2/docs#update-an-existing-resource), which allows you to update identities within a segment corresponding to prospects in [!DNL Outreach].

[!DNL Outreach] uses OAuth 2 with Authorization Grant as the authentication mechanism to communicate with the [!DNL Outreach] Update Resource API. Instructions to authenticate to your [!DNL Outreach] instance are further below, within [Authenticate to destination](#authenticate) section.

## Use cases {#use-cases}

As a marketer, you can deliver personalized experiences to your prospects, based on attributes from their Adobe Experience Platform profiles. You can build segments from your offline data and send these segments to [!DNL Outreach], to display in the prospectsâ€™ feeds as soon as segments and profiles are updated in Adobe Experience Platform.

## Prerequisites {#prerequisites}

### Experience Platform Prerequisites {#prerequisites-in-experience-platform}

Before activating data to the [!DNL Outreach] destination, you must have a [schema](/help/xdm/schema/composition.html), a [dataset](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/platform-learn/tutorials/data-ingestion/create-datasets-and-ingest-data.html?lang=en), and [segments](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/platform-learn/tutorials/segments/create-segments.html?lang=en) created in [!DNL Experience Platform].

Refer to Adobe's documentation for [Segment Membership Details schema field group](/help/xdm/field-groups/profile/segmentation.md) if you need guidance on segment statuses.

### Outreach Prerequisites {#prerequisites-destination}

Note the following prerequisites in [!DNL Outreach], in order to export data from Platform to your [!DNL Outreach] account:

#### You need to have an Outreach account {#prerequisites-account}

Go to the [!DNL Outreach] [sign in](https://accounts.outreach.io/users/sign_in) page to register and create an account, if you do not have one already. Also see the [!DNL Outreach] support [page](https://support.outreach.io/hc/en-us/articles/207238607-Claim-Your-Outreach-Account) for more details.

#### Setup custom field labels

[!DNL Outreach] supports custom fields for [prospects](https://support.outreach.io/hc/en-us/articles/360001557554-Outreach-Prospect-Profile-Overview). Refer to [How To add a custom field in Outreach](https://support.outreach.io/hc/en-us/articles/219124908-How-To-Add-a-Custom-Field-in-Outreach) for additional guidance. For ease of identification it is recommended to manually update the labels to their corresponding segment names instead of keeping the defaults. For example as below:

[!DNL Outreach] settings page for prospects displaying custom fields.
![[!DNL Outreach] custom fields defaults](../../assets/catalog/crm/outreach/outreach-custom-fields.png)

[!DNL Outreach] settings page for prospects displaying custom fields with *user-friendly* labels matching to the segment names. You can view the segment status on the prospect page against these labels.
![[!DNL Outreach] custom fields with labels](../../assets/catalog/crm/outreach/outreach-custom-field-labels.png)

> [!NOTE]
>
> Label names are for ease of identification only, they are not used when updating prospects.

### Mapping considerations and example {#mapping-considerations-example}

To correctly send your audience data from Adobe Experience Platform to the [!DNL Outreach] destination, you need to go through the field mapping step. Mapping consists of creating a link between your Experience Data Model (XDM) schema fields in your Platform account and their corresponding equivalents from the target destination. To correctly map your XDM fields to the [!DNL Outreach] destination fields, follow these steps:

1. In the "[!UICONTROL Mapping]" step, click **[!UICONTROL Add new mapping]**, you will see a new mapping row on the screen.
![Add new mapping](../../assets/catalog/crm/outreach/add-new-mapping.png)

1. In the "[!UICONTROL Select source field]" window, when selecting the source field choose the **[!UICONTROL Select identity namespace]** category and add the desired mappings.
![Source mapping](../../assets/catalog/crm/outreach/source-mapping.png)

1. In the "[!UICONTROL Select target field]" window, select the type of target field that you want to map your source field to.
    * **[!UICONTROL Select identity namespace]**: select this option to map your source field to an identity namespace from the list.
    ![Target mapping using OutreachId](../../assets/catalog/crm/outreach/target-mapping.png)

    * Add the following mapping between your XDM profile schema and your [!DNL Outreach] instance:
        |XDM Profile Schema|[!DNL Outreach] Instance| Mandatory|
        |---|---|---|
        |`Oid`|`OutreachId`| Yes |

    * **[!UICONTROL Select custom attributes]**: select this option to map your source field to a custom attribute that you define in the [!UICONTROL Attribute name] field. Refer to [[!DNL Outreach] prospect documentation](https://api.outreach.io/api/v2/docs#prospect) for a comprehensive list of supported attributes.
    ![Target mapping using LastName](../../assets/catalog/crm/outreach/target-mapping-lastname.png)

    * For instance, depending on the values you want to update, add the following mapping between your XDM profile schema and your [!DNL Outreach] instance:
        |XDM Profile Schema|[!DNL Outreach] Instance|
        |---|---|
        |`person.name.firstName`|`firstName`|
        |`person.name.lastName`|`lastName`|

1. An example using these mappings is shown below:
![Target mapping](../../assets/catalog/crm/outreach/mappings.png)

### Schedule segment export and example {#schedule-segment-export-example}

* When performing the [Schedule segment export](../../ui/activate/activate-segment-streaming-destinations.md) step you must manually map Platform segments to the custom field attribute in [!DNL Outreach].

* To do this, select each segment, then enter the corresponding numeric value which corresponds to the *Custom Field `N` Label* field from [!DNL Outreach] in the **[!UICONTROL Mapping ID]** field.
    > [!IMPORTANT]
    >
    > * The numeric value *(`N`)* used within the Mapping ID should match the custom attribute key suffixed with the numeric value i.e. *Custom Field `N` Label* within [!DNL Outreach]. 
    > * Note you only need to specify the number.
    > * A maximum of *Custom Field `1` Label* ... *Custom Field `150` Label* fields are supported within [!DNL Outreach].
    > * Refer to [[!DNL Outreach] prospect documentation](https://api.outreach.io/api/v2/docs#prospect) for details.

* For example:
    |[!DNL Outreach] Field|Platform Mapping ID|
    |---|---|
    | Custom Field `4` Label | `4` |
