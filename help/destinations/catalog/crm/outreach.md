# [!DNL Outreach] connection

## Overview {#overview}

[[!DNL Outreach]](https://www.outreach.io/) is a Sales Execution Platform with the most B2B buyer-seller interaction data in the world and significant investments in proprietary AI technologies to translate sales data into intelligence. [!DNL Outreach] helps organizations automate sales engagement and act on revenue intelligence to improve their efficiency, predictability, and growth.

This [!DNL Adobe Experience Platform] [destination](/help/destinations/home.md) leverages the [Outreach Update Resource API](https://api.outreach.io/api/v2/docs#update-an-existing-resource), which allows you to update identities within an audience corresponding to prospects in [!DNL Outreach].

[!DNL Outreach] uses OAuth 2 with Authorization Grant as the authentication mechanism to communicate with the [!DNL Outreach] [!DNL Update Resource API]. Instructions to authenticate to your [!DNL Outreach] instance are further below, within [Authenticate to destination](#authenticate) section.

## Use cases {#use-cases}

As a marketer, you can deliver personalized experiences to your prospects, based on attributes from their Adobe Experience Platform profiles. You can build audiences from your offline data and send these audiences to [!DNL Outreach], to display in the prospects' feeds as soon as audiences and profiles are updated in Adobe Experience Platform.

## Prerequisites {#prerequisites}

### Experience Platform prerequisites {#prerequisites-in-experience-platform}

Before activating data to the [!DNL Outreach] destination, you must have a [schema](/help/xdm/schema/composition.md), a [dataset](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/platform-learn/tutorials/data-ingestion/create-datasets-and-ingest-data.html?lang=en), and [segments](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/platform-learn/tutorials/segments/create-segments.html?lang=en) created in [!DNL Experience Platform].

Refer to Adobe's documentation for [Audience Membership Details schema field group](/help/xdm/field-groups/profile/segmentation.md) if you need guidance on audience statuses.

### Outreach prerequisites {#prerequisites-destination}

Note the following prerequisites in [!DNL Outreach], in order to export data from Platform to your [!DNL Outreach] account:

#### You need to have an Outreach account {#prerequisites-account}

Go to the [!DNL Outreach] [sign in](https://accounts.outreach.io/users/sign_in) page to register and create an account, if you do not have one already. Also see the [!DNL Outreach] support [page](https://support.outreach.io/hc/en-us/articles/207238607-Claim-Your-Outreach-Account) for more details.

Note down the items below before you authenticate to the [!DNL Outreach] CRM destination:

| Credential | Description |
|---|---|
| Email | Your [!DNL Outreach] account email |
| Password | Your [!DNL Outreach] account password |

#### Set up custom field labels {#prerequisites-custom-fields}

[!DNL Outreach] supports custom fields for [prospects](https://support.outreach.io/hc/en-us/articles/360001557554-Outreach-Prospect-Profile-Overview). Refer to [How To add a custom field in Outreach](https://support.outreach.io/hc/en-us/articles/219124908-How-To-Add-a-Custom-Field-in-Outreach) for additional guidance. For ease of identification it is recommended to manually update the labels to their corresponding audience names instead of keeping the defaults. For example as below:

[!DNL Outreach] settings page for prospects displaying custom fields.
![Outreach UI screenshot showing the custom fields on the settings page.](../../assets/catalog/crm/outreach/outreach-custom-fields.png)

[!DNL Outreach] settings page for prospects displaying custom fields with *user-friendly* labels matching to the audience names. You can view the audience status on the prospect page against these labels.
![Outreach UI screenshot showing custom fields with associated labels on the settings page.](../../assets/catalog/crm/outreach/outreach-custom-field-labels.png)

>[!NOTE]
>
> Label names are for ease of identification only. They are not used when updating prospects.

## Guardrails

The [!DNL Outreach] API has a rate limit of 10,000 requests per hour per user. If you reach this limit you will receive a `429` response with the following message: `You have exceeded your permitted rate limit of 10,000; please try again at 2017-01-01T00:00:00.`.

If you received this message, you must update your audience export schedule to conform to the rate threshold.

Refer to the [[!DNL Outreach] documentation](https://api.outreach.io/api/v2/docs#rate-limiting) for additional details.

## Supported identities {#supported-identities}

### Mapping considerations and example {#mapping-considerations-example}

To correctly send your audience data from Adobe Experience Platform to the [!DNL Outreach] destination, you need to go through the field mapping step. Mapping consists of creating a link between your Experience Data Model (XDM) schema fields in your Platform account and their corresponding equivalents from the target destination. To correctly map your XDM fields to the [!DNL Outreach] destination fields, follow these steps:

1. In the [!UICONTROL Mapping] step, click **[!UICONTROL Add new mapping]**. You will see a new mapping row on the screen.
![Platform UI screenshot showing how to Add new mapping](../../assets/catalog/crm/outreach/add-new-mapping.png)

1. In the [!UICONTROL Select source field] window, choose the **[!UICONTROL Select identity namespace]** category and add the desired mappings.
![Platform UI screenshot showing Source mapping](../../assets/catalog/crm/outreach/source-mapping.png)

1. In the [!UICONTROL Select target field] window, select the type of target field that you want to map your source field to.
    * **[!UICONTROL Select identity namespace]**: select this option to map your source field to an identity namespace from the list.
    ![Platform UI screenshot showing Target mapping using OutreachId.](../../assets/catalog/crm/outreach/target-mapping.png)

    * Add the following mapping between your XDM profile schema and your [!DNL Outreach] instance:
        |XDM Profile Schema|[!DNL Outreach] Instance| Mandatory|
        |---|---|---|
        |`Oid`|`OutreachId`| Yes |

    * **[!UICONTROL Select custom attributes]**: select this option to map your source field to a custom attribute that you define in the [!UICONTROL Attribute name] field. Refer to [[!DNL Outreach] prospect documentation](https://api.outreach.io/api/v2/docs#prospect) for a comprehensive list of supported attributes.
    ![Platform UI screenshot showing Target mapping using LastName.](../../assets/catalog/crm/outreach/target-mapping-lastname.png)

    * For instance, depending on the values you want to update, add the following mapping between your XDM profile schema and your [!DNL Outreach] instance:
        |XDM Profile Schema|[!DNL Outreach] Instance|
        |---|---|
        |`person.name.firstName`|`firstName`|
        |`person.name.lastName`|`lastName`|

    * An example using these mappings is shown below:
    ![Platform UI screenshot example showing Target mappings.](../../assets/catalog/crm/outreach/mappings.png)

### Schedule audience export and example {#schedule-segment-export-example}

* When performing the [Schedule audience export](../../ui/activate-segment-streaming-destinations.md) step you must manually map Platform audiences to the custom field attribute in [!DNL Outreach].

* To do this, select each segment, then enter the corresponding numeric value which corresponds to the *Custom Field `N` Label* field from [!DNL Outreach] in the **[!UICONTROL Mapping ID]** field.
    
    >[!IMPORTANT]
    >
    > * The numeric value *(`N`)* used within the [!UICONTROL Mapping ID] should match the custom attribute key suffixed with the numeric value within [!DNL Outreach]. Example: *Custom Field `N` Label*.
    > * You only need to specify the numeric value, not the whole custom field label.
    > * [!DNL Outreach] supports a maximum of 150 custom label fields.
    > * Refer to [[!DNL Outreach] prospect documentation](https://api.outreach.io/api/v2/docs#prospect) for details.

    * For example:
    
        |[!DNL Outreach] Field|Platform Mapping ID|
        |---|---|
        | Custom Field `4` Label | `4` |

        ![Platform UI screenshot showing an example Mapping Id during Schedule audience export.](../../assets/catalog/crm/outreach/schedule-segment-export.png)

![Platform UI screenshot showing Segment summary.](../../assets/catalog/crm/outreach/segment.png)

1. Log in to the [!DNL Outreach] website, then navigate to the [!DNL Apps] > [!DNL Contacts] page and check if the profiles from the audience have been added. You can see that each audience status in [!DNL Outreach] was updated with the corresponding audience status from Platform, based on the [!UICONTROL Mapping ID] value provided during the [audience scheduling](#schedule-segment-export-example) step.

![Outreach UI screenshot showing the Outreach Prospects page with the updated audience statuses.](../../assets/catalog/crm/outreach/outreach-prospect.png)
