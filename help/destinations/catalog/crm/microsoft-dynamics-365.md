# [!DNL Microsoft Dynamics 365] connection

## Overview {#overview}

[Microsoft Dynamics 365](https://dynamics.microsoft.com/en-us/) is a cloud-based business application platform that combines Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) and Customer Relationship Management (CRM) along with productivity applications and AI tools, to bring end-to-end smoother and more controlled operations, better growth potential and reduced costs.

This [!DNL Adobe Experience Platform] [destination](/help/destinations/home.md) leverages the [Contact Entity Reference API](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/customerengagement/on-premises/developer/entities/contact?view=op-9-1), which allows you to update identities within a segment into Dynamics 365.

Dynamics 365 uses OAuth 2 with Authorization Grant as the authentication mechanism to communicate with the Contact Entity Reference API. Instructions to authenticate to your Dynamics 365 instance are further below, in the [Authenticate to destination](#authenticate) section.

## Use cases {#use-cases}

As a marketer, you can deliver personalized experiences to your users, based on attributes from their Adobe Experience Platform profiles. You can build segments from your offline data and send these segments to Dynamics 365, to display in the usersâ€™ feeds as soon as segments and profiles are updated in Adobe Experience Platform.

## Prerequisites {#prerequisites}

### Prerequisites in Experience Platform {#prerequisites-in-experience-platform}

Before activating data to the Microsoft Dynamics 365 destination, you must have a [schema](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-platform/xdm/schema/composition.html), a [dataset](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/platform-learn/tutorials/data-ingestion/create-datasets-and-ingest-data.html?lang=en), and [segments](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/platform-learn/tutorials/segments/create-segments.html?lang=en) created in [!DNL Experience Platform].

### Prerequisites in Microsoft Dynamics 365 {#prerequisites-destination}

Note the following prerequisites in Microsoft Dynamics 365, in order to export data from Platform to your Dynamics 365 account:

#### You need to have a Microsoft Dynamics 365 account {#prerequisites-account}

Go to the Dynamics 365 [trial](https://dynamics.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics-365-free-trial/) page to register and create an account, if you do not have one already.

#### Create field within Dynamics 365 {#prerequisites-custom-field}

Create the custom field of type `Simple` with field data type as `Single Line of Text` which Experience Platform will use to update the segment status within Dynamics 365.

|Target Identity|Description|Considerations|
|---|---|---|
| contactId |Custom Microsoft Dynamics 365 identifier that supports mapping of any identity.|Mandatory. You can send any [identity](../../../identity-service/namespaces.md) to the [!DNL Microsoft Dynamics 365] destination, as long as you map it to the `contactId`. |

## Export type and frequency {#export-type-frequency}

Refer to the table below for information about the destination export type and frequency.

| Item | Type | Notes |
---------|----------|---------|
| Export type | **[!UICONTROL Profile-based]** | <ul><li>You are exporting all members of a segment, together with the desired schema fields *(for example: email address, phone number, last name)*, according to your field mapping.</li><li> Platform segment statuses are exported to [!DNL Dynamics 365] by specifying their corresponding custom field attribute in [!DNL Dynamics 365], within the **[!UICONTROL Activate Destination]** > **[!UICONTROL Schedule segment export]** > **[!UICONTROL Mapping ID]** field.</li></ul> |
| Export frequency | **[!UICONTROL Streaming]** | <ul><li>Streaming destinations are "always on" API-based connections. As soon as a profile is updated in Experience Platform based on segment evaluation, the connector sends the update downstream to the destination platform. Read more about [streaming destinations](/help/destinations/destination-types.md#streaming-destinations).</li></ul>|

## Activate segments to this destination {#activate}

> [!IMPORTANT]
> 
> To activate data, you need the **[!UICONTROL Manage Destinations]**, **[!UICONTROL Activate Destinations]**, **[!UICONTROL View Profiles]**, and **[!UICONTROL View Segments]** [access control permissions](/help/access-control/home.md#permissions). Read the [access control overview](/help/access-control/ui/overview.md) or contact your product administrator to obtain the required permissions.

Read [Activate profiles and segments to streaming segment export destinations](../../ui/activate/activate-segment-streaming-destinations.md) for instructions on activating audience segments to this destination.

### Mapping considerations and example {#mapping-considerations-example}

To correctly send your audience data from Adobe Experience Platform to the Microsoft Dynamics 365 destination, you need to go through the field mapping step. Mapping consists of creating a link between your Experience Data Model (XDM) schema fields in your Platform account and their corresponding equivalents from the target destination. To correctly map your XDM fields to the Microsoft Dynamics 365 destination fields, follow these steps:

1. In the Mapping step, click **[!UICONTROL Add new mapping]**, you will see a new mapping row on the screen.
![Add new mapping](../../assets/catalog/crm/microsoft-dynamics-365/add-new-mapping.png)

1. In the select source field window, when selecting the source field choose the **[!UICONTROL Select identity namespace]** category and add the mappings desired.
![Source mapping](../../assets/catalog/crm/microsoft-dynamics-365/source-mapping.png)

1. In the select target field window, select the target field and choose the **[!UICONTROL Select identity namespace]** category and add the mappings desired.
![Target mapping using contactId](../../assets/catalog/crm/microsoft-dynamics-365/target-mapping-contactid.png)

1. For custom attributes, in the select target field window, select the target field and choose the **[!UICONTROL Select custom attributes]** category, Next provide the desired target attribute name and add the mappings desired.
![Target mapping using LastName](../../assets/catalog/crm/microsoft-dynamics-365/target-mapping-lastname.png)

1. For instance, you could add the following mapping between your XDM profile schema and your [!DNL Dynamics 365] instance:

    ||XDM Profile Schema|[!DNL Dynamics 365] Instance| Mandatory|
    |---|---|---|---|
    |Attributes|<ul><li><code>person.name.firstName</code></li><li><code>person.name.lastName</code></li><li><code>personalEmail.address</code></li></ul>|<ul><li><code>FirstName</code></li><li><code>LastName</code></li><li><code>Email</code></li></ul>|
    |Identities|<ul><li><code>contactId</code></li></ul>|<ul><li><code>contactId</code></li></ul>|Yes|

1. An example using these mappings is shown below:
![Target mapping](../../assets/catalog/crm/microsoft-dynamics-365/mappings.png)

> [!NOTE]
>
> When mapping to a Dynamics 365 [date or timestamp](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/power-apps/developer/data-platform/webapi/reference/timestampdatemapping?view=dataverse-latest), the corresponding attribute value in the dataset should not be empty else during execution, else you will encounter [errors](#unknown-errors).

### Schedule segment export and example {#schedule-segment-export-example}

When performing the [Schedule segment export](../../ui/activate/activate-segment-streaming-destinations.html?lang=en#scheduling) step you must manually map Platform segments to the custom field attribute in Dynamics 365.

To do this, select each segment, then enter the corresponding custom field attribute from Dynamics 365 in the **[!UICONTROL Mapping ID]** field.

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> The value used for the Mapping ID should exactly match the name of the custom field attribute created within Dynamics 365.

An example is shown below:
![Schedule segment export](../../assets/catalog/crm/microsoft-dynamics-365/schedule-segment-export.png)

## Validate data export {#exported-data}

To validate that you have correctly set up the destination, follow the steps below:

1. Select **[!UICONTROL Destinations]** > **[!UICONTROL Browse]** to navigate to the list of destinations.
![Browse Destinations](../../assets/catalog/crm/microsoft-dynamics-365/browse-destinations.png)

1. Select the destination and validate that the status is **[!UICONTROL enabled]**.
![Destinations Dataflow Run](../../assets/catalog/crm/microsoft-dynamics-365/destination-dataflow-run.png)

1. Switch to the **[!DNL Activation data]** tab, then select a segment name.
![Destinations Activation Data](../../assets/catalog/crm/microsoft-dynamics-365/destinations-activation-data.png)

1. Monitor the segment summary and ensure that the count of profiles corresponds to the count created within the segment.
![Segment](../../assets/catalog/crm/microsoft-dynamics-365/segment.png)

1. Login to the Dynamics 365 website, then navigate to the **[!DNL Apps]** > **[!DNL Contacts]** page and check if the profiles from the segment have been added. You will also notice the segment status from Experience Platform has been updated against the corresponding custom field attribute that was provided in the **Mapping ID** field during the **[!UICONTROL Activate destination]** > **[!UICONTROL Schedule segment export]** step.
