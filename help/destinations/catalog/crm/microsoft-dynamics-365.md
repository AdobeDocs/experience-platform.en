# [!DNL Microsoft Dynamics 365] connection

## Overview {#overview}

[[!DNL Microsoft Dynamics 365]](https://dynamics.microsoft.com/en-us/) is a cloud-based business application platform that combines Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) and Customer Relationship Management (CRM) along with productivity applications and AI tools, to bring end-to-end smoother and more controlled operations, better growth potential and reduced costs.

This [!DNL Adobe Experience Platform] [destination](/help/destinations/home.md) leverages the [[!DNL Contact Entity Reference API]](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/customerengagement/on-premises/developer/entities/contact?view=op-9-1), which allows you to update identities within an audience into [!DNL Dynamics 365].

[!DNL Dynamics 365] uses OAuth 2 with Authorization Grant as the authentication mechanism to communicate with the [!DNL Contact Entity Reference API]. Instructions to authenticate to your [!DNL Dynamics 365] instance are further below, in the [Authenticate to destination](#authenticate) section.

## Use cases {#use-cases}

As a marketer, you can deliver personalized experiences to your users, based on attributes from their Adobe Experience Platform profiles. You can build audiences from your offline data and send these audiences to [!DNL Dynamics 365], to display in the users' feeds as soon as audiences and profiles are updated in Adobe Experience Platform.

## Prerequisites {#prerequisites}

### Experience Platform prerequisites {#prerequisites-in-experience-platform}

Before activating data to the [!DNL Dynamics 365] destination, you must have a [schema](/help/xdm/schema/composition.md), a [dataset](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/platform-learn/tutorials/data-ingestion/create-datasets-and-ingest-data.html), and [audiences](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/platform-learn/tutorials/audiences/create-audiences.html) created in [!DNL Experience Platform].

Refer to Adobe's documentation for [Audience Membership Details schema field group](/help/xdm/field-groups/profile/segmentation.md) if you need guidance on audience statuses.

### [!DNL Microsoft Dynamics 365] prerequisites {#prerequisites-destination}

Note the following prerequisites in [!DNL Dynamics 365], in order to export data from Platform to your [!DNL Dynamics 365] account:

### Mapping considerations and example {#mapping-considerations-example}

To correctly send your audience data from Adobe Experience Platform to the [!DNL Dynamics 365] destination, you need to go through the field mapping step. Mapping consists of creating a link between your Experience Data Model (XDM) schema fields in your Platform account and their corresponding equivalents from the target destination. To correctly map your XDM fields to the [!DNL Dynamics 365] destination fields, follow these steps:

1. In the **[!UICONTROL Mapping]** step, select **[!UICONTROL Add new mapping]**. You will see a new mapping row on the screen.
![Platform UI screenshot example for Add new mapping.](../../assets/catalog/crm/microsoft-dynamics-365/add-new-mapping.png)

1. In the **[!UICONTROL Select source field]** window, choose the **[!UICONTROL Select identity namespace]** category and select `contactId`.
![Platform UI screenshot example for Source mapping.](../../assets/catalog/crm/microsoft-dynamics-365/source-mapping.png)

1. In the **[!UICONTROL Select target field]** window, select the type of target field that you want to map your source field to.
    * **[!UICONTROL Select identity namespace]**: select this option to map your source field to an identity namespace from the list.
    ![Platform UI screenshot showing Target mapping for contactId.](../../assets/catalog/crm/microsoft-dynamics-365/target-mapping-contactid.png)

    * Add the following mapping between your XDM profile schema and your [!DNL Dynamics 365] instance:
        |XDM Profile Schema|[!DNL Dynamics 365] Instance| Mandatory|
        |---|---|---|
        |`contactId`|`contactId`| Yes |

    * **[!UICONTROL Select custom attributes]**: select this option to map your source field to a custom attribute that you define in the **[!UICONTROL Attribute name]** field. Refer to [[!DNL Dynamics 365] documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/customerengagement/on-premises/developer/entities/contact?view=op-9-1#entity-properties) for a comprehensive list of supported attributes.
    ![Platform UI screenshot showing Target mapping for LastName.](../../assets/catalog/crm/microsoft-dynamics-365/target-mapping-lastname.png)

        >[!IMPORTANT]
        >
        >If you have a date or timestamp source field which is mapped to a [!DNL Dynamics 365] [date or timestamp](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/power-apps/developer/data-platform/webapi/reference/timestampdatemapping?view=dataverse-latest) target field, ensure that the mapped value being is not empty. If the value passed is empty you will encounter a *`Bad request reported while pushing events to the destination. Please contact the administrator and try again.`* error message and the data will not be updated. This is a [!DNL Dynamics 365] limitation.

    * For instance, depending on the values you want to update, add the following mapping between your XDM profile schema and your [!DNL Dynamics 365] instance:
        |XDM Profile Schema|[!DNL Dynamics 365] Instance|
        |---|---|
        |`person.name.firstName`|`FirstName`|
        |`person.name.lastName`|`LastName`|
        |`personalEmail.address`|`Email`|

    * An example using these mappings is shown below:
    ![Platform UI screenshot example showing Target mappings.](../../assets/catalog/crm/microsoft-dynamics-365/mappings.png)

### Schedule audience export and example {#schedule-audience-export-example}

In the [[!UICONTROL Schedule audience export]](/help/destinations/ui/activate-segment-streaming-destinations.md#scheduling) step of the activation workflow, you must manually map Platform audiences to the custom field attribute in [!DNL Dynamics 365].

To do this, select each audience, then enter the corresponding custom field attribute from [!DNL Dynamics 365] in the **[!UICONTROL Mapping ID]** field.

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>The value used for the **[!UICONTROL Mapping ID]** should exactly match the name of the custom field attribute created within [!DNL Dynamics 365]. See [[!DNL Dynamics 365] documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/customerengagement/on-premises/customize/create-edit-fields?view=op-9-1) if you need guidance on finding your custom field attributes.

An example is shown below:
![Platform UI screenshot example showing Schedule audience export.](../../assets/catalog/crm/microsoft-dynamics-365/schedule-segment-export.png)

## Validate data export {#exported-data}

To validate that you have correctly set up the destination, follow the steps below:

1. Select **[!UICONTROL Destinations]** > **[!UICONTROL Browse]** to navigate to the list of destinations.
![Platform UI screenshot showing Browse Destinations.](../../assets/catalog/crm/microsoft-dynamics-365/browse-destinations.png)

1. Select the destination and validate that the status is **[!UICONTROL enabled]**.
![Platform UI screenshot showing Destinations Dataflow Run.](../../assets/catalog/crm/microsoft-dynamics-365/destination-dataflow-run.png)

1. Switch to the **[!DNL Activation data]** tab, then select an audience name.
![Platform UI screenshot example showing Destinations Activation Data.](../../assets/catalog/crm/microsoft-dynamics-365/destinations-activation-data.png)

1. Monitor the audience summary and ensure that the count of profiles corresponds to the count created within the audience.
![Platform UI screenshot example showing audience.](../../assets/catalog/crm/microsoft-dynamics-365/segment.png)

1. Log in to the [!DNL Dynamics 365] website, then navigate to the [!DNL Customers] > [!DNL Contacts] page and check if the profiles from the audience have been added. You can see that each audience status in [!DNL Dynamics 365] was updated with the corresponding audience status from Platform, based on the **[!UICONTROL Mapping ID]** value provided during the [audience scheduling](#schedule-audience-export-example) step.
![Dynamics 365 UI screenshot showing the Contacts page with updated audience statuses.](../../assets/catalog/crm/microsoft-dynamics-365/contacts.png)

## Data usage and governance {#data-usage-governance}

All [!DNL Adobe Experience Platform] destinations are compliant with data usage policies when handling your data. For detailed information on how [!DNL Adobe Experience Platform] enforces data governance, see the [Data Governance overview](/help/data-governance/home.md).

## Errors and troubleshooting {#errors-and-troubleshooting}

### Unknown errors encountered while pushing events to destination {#unknown-errors}

When checking a dataflow run, if you obtain the following error message: `Bad request reported while pushing events to the destination. Please contact the administrator and try again.`

![Platform UI screenshot showing Bad request error.](../../assets/catalog/crm/microsoft-dynamics-365/error.png)
