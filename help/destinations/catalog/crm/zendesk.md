# [!DNL Zendesk] connection

[[!DNL Zendesk]](https://www.zendesk.com) is a customer service solution and sales tool.

This [!DNL Adobe Experience Platform] [destination](/help/destinations/home.md) leverages the [[!DNL Zendesk] Contacts API](https://developer.zendesk.com/api-reference/sales-crm/resources/contacts/), to **create and update identities** within an audience as contacts within [!DNL Zendesk].

[!DNL Zendesk] uses bearer tokens as an authentication mechanism to communicate with the [!DNL Zendesk] Contacts API. Instructions to authenticate to your [!DNL Zendesk] instance are further below, in the [Authenticate to destination](#authenticate) section.

## Use cases {#use-cases}

The customer service department of a multichannel B2C platform wants to ensure a seamless personalized experience for its customers. The department can build audiences from their own offline data to create new user profiles or update existing profile information from different interactions (for example purchases, returns etc.) and send these audiences from Adobe Experience Platform to [!DNL Zendesk]. Having the updated information in [!DNL Zendesk] ensures the customer service agent has the recent information of the customer immediately available, enabling quicker responses and resolution.

## Prerequisites {#prerequisites}

### Experience Platform prerequisites {#prerequisites-in-experience-platform}

Before activating data to the [!DNL Zendesk] destination, you must have a [schema](/help/xdm/schema/composition.md), a [dataset](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/platform-learn/tutorials/data-ingestion/create-datasets-and-ingest-data.html), and [segments](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/platform-learn/tutorials/segments/create-segments.html) created in [!DNL Experience Platform].

Refer to Experience Platform documentation for [Audience Membership Details schema field group](/help/xdm/field-groups/profile/segmentation.md) if you need guidance on audience statuses.

### [!DNL Zendesk] prerequisites {#prerequisites-destination}

In order to export data from Platform to your [!DNL Zendesk] account you need to have a [!DNL Zendesk] account.

#### Gather [!DNL Zendesk] credentials {#gather-credentials}

Note down the items below before you authenticate to the [!DNL Zendesk] destination:

| Credential | Description | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `Bearer token` | The Access token you have generated in your [!DNL Zendesk] account. <br> Follow the documentation to [generate a [!DNL Zendesk] access token](https://developer.zendesk.com/documentation/sales-crm/first-call/#1-generate-an-access-token) if you do not have one.| `a0b1c2d3e4...v20w21x22y23z` |

## Guardrails {#guardrails}

The [Pricing and Rate Limits](https://developer.zendesk.com/api-reference/sales-crm/rate-limits/#pricing) page details the [!DNL Zendesk] API limits associated with your account. You need to ensure that your data and payload are within these constraints.

## Supported identities {#supported-identities}

[!DNL Zendesk] supports update of identities described in the table below. Learn more about [identities](/help/identity-service/features/namespaces.md).

|Target Identity|Example|Description|Mandatory|
|---|---|---|---|
| `email` | `test@test.com` | Email address of the contact.| Yes |

## Export type and frequency {#export-type-frequency}

Refer to the table below for information about the destination export type and frequency.

| Item | Type | Notes |
---------|----------|---------|
| Export type | **[!UICONTROL Profile-based]** | <ul><li>You are exporting all members of a segment, together with the desired schema fields *(for example: email address, phone number, last name)*, according to your field mapping.</li><li> Each segment status in [!DNL Zendesk] gets updated with the corresponding audience status from Platform, based on the **[!UICONTROL Mapping ID]** value provided during the [audience scheduling](#schedule-segment-export-example) step.</li></ul> |
| Export frequency | **[!UICONTROL Streaming]** | <ul><li>Streaming destinations are "always on" API-based connections. As soon as a profile is updated in Experience Platform based on audience evaluation, the connector sends the update downstream to the destination platform. Read more about [streaming destinations](/help/destinations/destination-types.md#streaming-destinations).</li></ul>|

### Mapping considerations and example {#mapping-considerations-example}

To correctly send your audience data from Adobe Experience Platform to the [!DNL Zendesk] destination, you need to go through the field mapping step. Mapping consists of creating a link between your Experience Data Model (XDM) schema fields in your Platform account and their corresponding equivalents from the target destination.

Attributes specified in the **[!UICONTROL Target field]** should be named exactly as described in the attribute mappings table as these attributes will form the request body.

Attributes specified in the **[!UICONTROL Source field]** do not follow any such restriction. You can map it based on your need, however if the data format is not correct when pushed to [!DNL Zendesk] it will result in an error.

To correctly map your XDM fields to the [!DNL Zendesk] destination fields, follow these steps:

1. In the **[!UICONTROL Mapping]** step, select **[!UICONTROL Add new mapping]**. You will see a new mapping row on the screen.
1. In the **[!UICONTROL Select source field]** window, choose the **[!UICONTROL Select attributes]** category and select the XDM attribute or choose the **[!UICONTROL Select identity namespace]** and select an identity.
1. In the **[!UICONTROL Select target field]** window, choose the **[!UICONTROL Select identity namespace]** category and select a target identity, or choose the **[!UICONTROL Select attributes]** category and select one of the supported schema attributes.
    * Repeat these steps to add the following mandatory mappings, you can also add any other attributes you want to update between your XDM profile schema and your [!DNL Zendesk] instance:
        |Source Field|Target Field| Mandatory|
        |---|---|---|
        |`xdm: person.name.lastName`|`xdm: last_name`| Yes |
        |`IdentityMap: Email`|`Identity: email`| Yes |
        |`xdm: person.name.firstName`|`xdm: first_name`| |

    * An example using these mappings is shown below:
    ![Platform UI screenshot example with attribute mappings.](../../assets/catalog/crm/zendesk/mappings.png)

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>The `Attribute: last_name` and `Identity: email` target mappings are mandatory for this destination. If these mappings are missing, any other mappings are ignored and not sent to [!DNL Zendesk].

When you are finished providing the mappings for your destination connection, select **[!UICONTROL Next]**.

### Schedule audience export and example {#schedule-segment-export-example}

In the [[!UICONTROL Schedule audience export]](/help/destinations/ui/activate-segment-streaming-destinations.md#scheduling) step of the activation workflow, you must manually map Platform audiences to the custom field attribute in [!DNL Zendesk].

To do this, select each segment, then enter the corresponding custom field attribute from [!DNL Zendesk] in the **[!UICONTROL Mapping ID]** field.

An example is shown below:
![Platform UI screenshot example showing Schedule audience export.](../../assets/catalog/crm/zendesk/schedule-segment-export.png)

## Validate data export {#exported-data}

To validate that you have correctly set up the destination, follow the steps below:

1. Select **[!UICONTROL Destinations]** > **[!UICONTROL Browse]** and navigate to the list of destinations.
1. Next, select the destination and switch to the **[!UICONTROL Activation data]** tab, then select an audience name.
![Platform UI screenshot example showing Destinations Activation Data.](../../assets/catalog/crm/zendesk/destinations-activation-data.png)

1. Monitor the audience summary and ensure that the count of profiles corresponds to the count within the segment.
![Platform UI screenshot example showing Segment.](../../assets/catalog/crm/zendesk/segment.png)

1. Log in to the [!DNL Zendesk] website, then navigate to the **[!UICONTROL Contacts]** page to check if the profiles from the audience have been added. This list can be configured to display columns for the additional fields created with the audience**[!UICONTROL Mapping ID]** and audience statuses.
![Zendesk UI screenshot showing the Contacts page with the additional fields created with the audience name.](../../assets/catalog/crm/zendesk/contacts.png)

1. You can alternatively drill down into an individual **[!UICONTROL Person]** page and check the **[!UICONTROL Additional fields]** section displaying the audience name and audience statuses.
