# [!DNL Salesforce CRM] connection

## Overview {#overview}

[Salesforce CRM](https://www.salesforce.com/) is a popular Customer Relationship Management (CRM) platform.

This [!DNL Adobe Experience Platform] [destination](/help/destinations/home.md) leverages the [Salesforce REST API](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.api_rest.meta/api_rest/dome_composite_upsert_example.htm?q=contacts), which allows you to add accounts and create contacts after activating them within a new Salesforce segment for your business needs.

Salesforce CRM uses OAuth 2 with Password Grant as an authentication mechanism to communicate with the Salesforce REST API. Instructions to authenticate to your Salesforce CRM instance are further below, in the [Authenticate to destination](#authenticate) section.

## Use cases {#use-cases}

To help you better understand how and when you should use the Salesforce CRM destination, here are sample use cases that Adobe Experience Platform customers can solve by using this destination.

### Send emails to contacts for marketing campaigns

The sales department of a home rental platform wants to broadcast a marketing email to a targeted customer audience. The platform's marketing team can add new customer contacts into CRM through Adobe Experience Platform, build segments from their own offline data, and send these segments to Salesforce CRM, which can then be used to send the marketing campaign email.

### Display ads in the social media feeds of existing customers

An athletic apparel brand wants to reach existing customers through their social media accounts. The apparel brand can ingest email addresses from their own CRM to Adobe Experience Platform, build segments from their own offline data, and send these segments to Salesforce CRM, to display ads in their customersâ€™ social media feeds.

## Prerequisites {#prerequisites}

Before activating data to the Salesforce CRM destination, you must have a [schema](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-platform/xdm/schema/composition.html), a [dataset](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/platform-learn/tutorials/data-ingestion/create-datasets-and-ingest-data.html?lang=en), and [segments](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/platform-learn/tutorials/segments/create-segments.html?lang=en) created in [!DNL Experience Platform].

Note the following prerequisites in Salesforce, in order to export data from Platform to your Salesforce account:

1. You need to have a Salesforce account.
    * Go to the Salesforce [trial](https://www.salesforce.com/in/form/signup/freetrial-sales/) page to register and create a Salesforce account, if you do not have one already.
1. Next, You need to configure a [connected app](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.connected_app_create.htm&language=en_US&r=https%3A%2F%2Fhelp.salesforce.com%2F&type=5) within your Salesforce account, if you do not have one already. 
    * Within the connected app ensure that [OAuth Settings](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=connected_app_create_api_integration.htm&type=5&language=en_US) is enabled.
    * Also ensure that [scopes](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=connected_app_create_api_integration.htm&type=5&language=en_US) mentioned below are selected.

    * Note down your [Salesforce domain prefix](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.domain_name_setting_login_policy.htm&type=5). For example if your domain is *`d5i000000isb4eak-dev-ed`.my.salesforce.com*, you need the highlighted value.
    * Copy the *Consumer Key* and *Consumer Secret* from the connected app.
        * Refer to the [Salesforce documentation](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.connected_app_rotate_consumer_details.htm&type=5) if you need additional guidance.    

## Supported identities {#supported-identities}

Salesforce CRM supports the activation of identities described in the table below. Learn more about [identities](/help/identity-service/namespaces.md).

|Target Identity|Description|Considerations|
|---|---|---|
| email |Salesforce Email ID|Mandatory, Note that *Salesforce CRM* does not support hashed email addresses, hence only plain text data without transformation is sent to the destination.|

## Export type and frequency {#export-type-frequency}

Refer to the table below for information about the destination export type and frequency.

| Item | Type | Notes |
---------|----------|---------|
| Export type | **[!UICONTROL Profile-based]** | You are exporting all members of a segment, together with the desired schema fields (for example: email address, phone number, last name), as chosen in the select profile attributes screen of the [destination activation workflow](/help/destinations/ui/activate-batch-profile-destinations.md#select-attributes).|
| Export frequency | **[!UICONTROL Streaming]** | Streaming destinations are "always on" API-based connections. As soon as a profile is updated in Experience Platform based on segment evaluation, the connector sends the update downstream to the destination platform. Read more about [streaming destinations](/help/destinations/destination-types.md#streaming-destinations).|
