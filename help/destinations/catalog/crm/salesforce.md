# [!DNL Salesforce CRM] connection

## Overview {#overview}

[[!DNL Salesforce CRM]](https://www.salesforce.com/crm/) is a popular Customer Relationship Management (CRM) platform and supports the below:
* [Leads](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.object_reference.meta/object_reference/sforce_api_objects_lead.htm) - A lead is the name of a person or company who may (or may not) be interested in the products or services you sell.
* [Contacts](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.object_reference.meta/object_reference/sforce_api_objects_contact.htm) - A contact is an individual with whom one of your representatives has established a relationship and has been qualified as a potential customer.	 

This [!DNL Adobe Experience Platform] [destination](/help/destinations/home.md) leverages the [[!DNL Salesforce composite API]](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.api_rest.meta/api_rest/resources_composite_sobjects_collections_update.htm), which supports both types of profiles described above.

When [activating segments](#activate), you can select between either leads or contacts and update attributes and segment data into [!DNL Salesforce CRM].

[!DNL Salesforce CRM] uses OAuth 2 with Password Grant as an authentication mechanism to communicate with the Salesforce REST API. Instructions to authenticate to your [!DNL Salesforce CRM] instance are further below, in the [Authenticate to destination](#authenticate) section.

## Use cases {#use-cases}

As a marketer, you can deliver personalized experiences to your users, based on attributes from their Adobe Experience Platform profiles. You can build segments from your offline data and send these segments to Salesforce CRM, to display in the usersâ€™ feeds as soon as segments and profiles are updated in Adobe Experience Platform.

## Prerequisites {#prerequisites}

### Prerequisites in Experience Platform {#prerequisites-in-experience-platform}

Before activating data to the Salesforce CRM destination, you must have a [schema](/help/xdm/schema/composition.md), a [dataset](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/platform-learn/tutorials/data-ingestion/create-datasets-and-ingest-data.html?lang=en), and [segments](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/platform-learn/tutorials/segments/create-segments.html?lang=en) created in [!DNL Experience Platform].

### Prerequisites in [!DNL Salesforce CRM] {#prerequisites-destination}

Note the following prerequisites in [!DNL Salesforce CRM], in order to export data from Platform to your Salesforce account:

#### You need to have a Salesforce account {#prerequisites-account}

Go to the Salesforce [trial](https://www.salesforce.com/in/form/signup/freetrial-sales/) page to register and create a Salesforce account, if you do not have one already.

#### Configure a connected app {#prerequisites-connected-app}

Next, you need to configure a [connected app](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.connected_app_create.htm&language=en_US&r=https%3A%2F%2Fhelp.salesforce.com%2F&type=5) within your Salesforce account, if you do not have one already. 

Within the connected app, ensure that [OAuth Settings](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=connected_app_create_api_integration.htm&type=5&language=en_US) is enabled.

Also ensure that the [scopes](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=connected_app_create_api_integration.htm&type=5&language=en_US) mentioned below are selected.

* ``chatter_api``
* ``lightning``
* ``visualforce``
* ``content``
* ``openid``
* ``full``
* ``api``
* ``web``
* ``refresh_token``
* ``offline_access``

#### Create custom field within Salesforce {#prerequisites-custom-field}

Create the custom field of type `Text Area Long`, which Experience Platform will use to update the segment status within [!DNL Salesforce CRM]. 
Refer to the Salesforce documentation to [create custom fields](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.adding_fields.htm&type=5) if you need additional guidance. 

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>Ensure there are no whitespace characters in the field name. Instead, use the underscore `(_)` character as a separator.

>[!NOTE]
>
>* Objects in Salesforce are restricted to 25 External fields, see [Custom Field Attributes](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.custom_field_attributes.htm&type=5).
>* This restriction implies you will only be able to have at a maximum 25 Experience Platform segment memberships active at any time. 
>* If you have reached this limit within Salesforce, you will need to remove the custom attribute from Salesforce that were used to store the segment status against older segments within Experience Platform before a new **[!UICONTROL Mapping ID]** can be used.

Refer to the Adobe Experience Platform documentation for [Segment Membership Details schema field group](/help/xdm/field-groups/profile/segmentation.md) if you need guidance on segment statuses.

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>To activate data, you need the **[!UICONTROL Manage Destinations]**, **[!UICONTROL Activate Destinations]**, **[!UICONTROL View Profiles]**, and **[!UICONTROL View Segments]** [access control permissions](/help/access-control/home.md#permissions). Read the [access control overview](/help/access-control/ui/overview.md) or contact your product administrator to obtain the required permissions.

Read [Activate profiles and segments to streaming segment export destinations](/help/destinations/ui/activate-segment-streaming-destinations.md) for instructions on activating audience segments to this destination.

### Mapping considerations and example {#mapping-considerations-example}

To correctly send your audience data from Adobe Experience Platform to the [!DNL Salesforce CRM] destination, you need to go through the field mapping step. Mapping consists of creating a link between your Experience Data Model (XDM) schema fields in your Platform account and their corresponding equivalents from the target destination. To correctly map your XDM fields to the [!DNL Salesforce CRM] destination fields, follow these steps:

1. In the **[!UICONTROL Mapping]** step, select **[!UICONTROL Add new mapping]**, you will see a new mapping row on the screen.
![Platform UI screenshot example for Add new mapping.](../../assets/catalog/crm/salesforce/add-new-mapping.png)

1. In the **[!UICONTROL Select source field]** window, choose the **[!UICONTROL Select identity namespace]** or **[!UICONTROL Select Attributes]** category and select `crmID`.
![Platform UI screenshot example for Source mapping.](../../assets/catalog/crm/salesforce/source-mapping.png)

1. In the **[!UICONTROL Select target field]** window, choose the **[!UICONTROL Select identity namespace]** category and select `SalesforceId`.
    ![Platform UI screenshot showing Target mapping for SalesforceId.](../../assets/catalog/crm/salesforce/target-mapping-salesforceid.png)

    * Add the following mapping between your XDM profile schema and your [!DNL Salesforce CRM] instance:

    |XDM Profile Schema|[!DNL Salesforce CRM] Instance| Mandatory |
    |---|---|---|
    |`crmID`|`SalesforceId`|Yes|

    * **[!UICONTROL Select custom attributes]**: select this option to map your source field to a custom attribute that you have defined in the **[!UICONTROL Attribute name]** field. Refer to the [[!DNL Salesforce CRM] documentation](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.custom_field_attributes.htm&type=5) for guidance on supported attributes.
    ![Platform UI screenshot showing Target mapping for LastName.](../../assets/catalog/crm/salesforce/target-mapping-lastname.png)

    * If you are working with *Contacts* within your segment, refer to the Object Reference in Salesforce for [Contact](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.object_reference.meta/object_reference/sforce_api_objects_contact.htm) to define mappings for the fields to be updated.
    * You can identify mandatory fields by searching for the word *Required*, which is mentioned in field descriptions in the link above.
    * Depending on the fields you want to export or update, add mappings between your XDM profile schema and your [!DNL Salesforce CRM] instance:

    | XDM Profile Schema | [!DNL Salesforce CRM] Instance | Notes |
    | --- | --- | --- |
    |`person.name.lastName`|`LastName`| `Required`. Last name of the contact up to 80 characters. |    
    |`person.name.firstName`|`FirstName`| The contactâ€™s first name up to 40 characters. |
    |`personalEmail.address`|`Email`| The contactâ€™s email address. |

    * An example using these mappings is shown below:
    ![Platform UI screenshot example showing Target mappings.](../../assets/catalog/crm/salesforce/mappings-contacts.png)

    * If you are working with *Leads* within your segment, refer to the Object Reference in Salesforce for [Lead](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.object_reference.meta/object_reference/sforce_api_objects_lead.htm) to define mappings for the fields to be updated.
    * You can identify mandatory fields by searching for the word *Required*, which is mentioned in field descriptions in the link above.
    * Depending on the fields you want to export or update, add mappings between your XDM profile schema and your [!DNL Salesforce CRM] instance:

    | XDM Profile Schema | [!DNL Salesforce CRM] Instance | Notes |
    | --- | --- | --- |
    |`person.name.lastName`|`LastName`| `Required`. Last name of the contact up to 80 characters. |    
    |`b2b.companyName`|`Company`| `Required`. The leadâ€™s company. |
    |`personalEmail.address`|`Email`| The contactâ€™s email address. |

    * An example using these mappings is shown below:
    ![Platform UI screenshot example showing Target mappings.](../../assets/catalog/crm/salesforce/mappings-leads.png)    

### Schedule segment export and example {#schedule-segment-export-example}

When performing the [Schedule segment export](/help/destinations/ui/activate-segment-streaming-destinations.md#scheduling) step you must manually map Platform segments to the custom field attribute in Salesforce.

To do this, select each segment, then enter the corresponding custom field attribute from Salesforce in the **[!UICONTROL Mapping ID]** field.

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>* The value used for the **[!UICONTROL Mapping ID]** should exactly match the name of the custom field attribute created within Salesforce.
>* Ensure that the name of the custom field attribute you have created in Salesforce doesn't use the whitespace character.

An example is shown below:
![Platform UI screenshot example showing Schedule segment export.](../../assets/catalog/crm/salesforce/schedule-segment-export.png)

## Validate data export {#exported-data}

To validate that you have correctly set up the destination, follow the steps below:

1. Select **[!UICONTROL Destinations]** > **[!UICONTROL Browse]** to navigate to the list of destinations.
![Platform UI screenshot showing Browse Destinations.](../../assets/catalog/crm/salesforce/browse-destinations.png)

1. Select the destination and validate that the status is **[!UICONTROL enabled]**.
![Platform UI screenshot showing Destinations Dataflow Run.](../../assets/catalog/crm/salesforce/destination-dataflow-run.png)

1. Switch to the **[!UICONTROL Activation data]** tab, then select a segment name.
![Platform UI screenshot example showing Destinations Activation Data.](../../assets/catalog/crm/salesforce/destinations-activation-data.png)

1. Monitor the segment summary and ensure that the count of profiles corresponds to the count created within the segment.
![Platform UI screenshot example showing Segment.](../../assets/catalog/crm/salesforce/segment.png)

1. Finally, log in to the Salesforce website and validate if the profiles from the segment have been added or updated.
    * If you had *Contacts* within your Platform segment, navigate to the **[!DNL Apps]** > **[!DNL Contacts]** page.
    ![Salesforce CRM screenshot showing the Contacts page with the profiles from the segment.](../../assets/catalog/crm/salesforce/contacts.png)

    * Select a *Contact* and check if the fields are updated. You can see that each segment status in [!DNL Salesforce CRM] was updated with the corresponding segment status from Platform, based on the **[!UICONTROL Mapping ID]** value provided during the [segment scheduling](#schedule-segment-export-example).
    ![Salesforce CRM screenshot showing the Contact Details page with updated segment statuses.](../../assets/catalog/crm/salesforce/contact-info.png)

    * If you had *Leads* within your Platform segment, then navigate to the **[!DNL Apps]** > **[!DNL Leads]** page.
    ![Salesforce CRM screenshot showing the Leads page with the profiles from the segment.](../../assets/catalog/crm/salesforce/leads.png)

    * Select a *Lead* and check if the fields are updated. You can see that each segment status in [!DNL Salesforce CRM] was updated with the corresponding segment status from Platform, based on the **[!UICONTROL Mapping ID]** value provided during the [segment scheduling](#schedule-segment-export-example).
    ![Salesforce CRM screenshot showing the Lead Details page with updated segment statuses.](../../assets/catalog/crm/salesforce/lead-info.png)
