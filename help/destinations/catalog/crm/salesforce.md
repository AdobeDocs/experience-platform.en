# [!DNL Salesforce CRM] connection

## Overview {#overview} 

[[!DNL Salesforce CRM]](https://www.salesforce.com/crm/) is a popular Customer Relationship Management (CRM) platform and supports the types of profiles described below:

* [Leads](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.object_reference.meta/object_reference/sforce_api_objects_lead.htm) - A lead is the name of a person or company who may (or may not) be interested in the products or services you sell.
* [Contacts](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.object_reference.meta/object_reference/sforce_api_objects_contact.htm) - A contact is an individual with whom one of your representatives has established a relationship and has been qualified as a potential customer.     

This [!DNL Adobe Experience Platform] [destination](/help/destinations/home.md) leverages the [[!DNL Salesforce composite API]](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.api_rest.meta/api_rest/resources_composite_sobjects_collections_update.htm), which supports both types of profiles described above.

When [activating segments](#activate), you can select between either leads or contacts and update attributes and audience data into [!DNL Salesforce CRM].

[!DNL Salesforce CRM] uses OAuth 2 with Password Grant as an authentication mechanism to communicate with the Salesforce REST API. Instructions to authenticate to your [!DNL Salesforce CRM] instance are further below, in the [Authenticate to destination](#authenticate) section.

## Use cases {#use-cases}

As a marketer, you can deliver personalized experiences to your users, based on attributes from their Adobe Experience Platform profiles. You can build audiences from your offline data and send these audiences to Salesforce CRM, to update CRM membership as soon as audiences and profiles are updated in Adobe Experience Platform.

## Prerequisites {#prerequisites}

### Prerequisites in Experience Platform {#prerequisites-in-experience-platform}

Before activating data to the Salesforce CRM destination, you must have a [schema](/help/xdm/schema/composition.md), a [dataset](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/platform-learn/tutorials/data-ingestion/create-datasets-and-ingest-data.html), and [segments](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/platform-learn/tutorials/segments/create-segments.html) created in [!DNL Experience Platform].

### Prerequisites in [!DNL Salesforce CRM] {#prerequisites-destination}

Note the following prerequisites in [!DNL Salesforce CRM], in order to export data from Platform to your Salesforce account:

#### You need to have a [!DNL Salesforce] account {#prerequisites-account}

Go to the [!DNL Salesforce] [trial](https://www.salesforce.com/in/form/signup/freetrial-sales/) page to register and create a [!DNL Salesforce] account, if you do not have one already.

#### Configure a connected app within [!DNL Salesforce] {#prerequisites-connected-app}

First, you need to configure a [[!DNL Salesforce] connected app](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.connected_app_create.htm&language=en_US&r=https%3A%2F%2Fhelp.salesforce.com%2F&type=5) within your [!DNL Salesforce] account, if you do not have one already. [!DNL Salesforce CRM] will leverage the connected app to connect to [!DNL Salesforce].

Next, enable [!DNL OAuth Settings for API Integration] for the [!DNL Salesforce connected app]. Refer to the [[!DNL Salesforce]](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=connected_app_create_api_integration.htm&type=5&language=en_US) documentation for guidance.

Also, ensure that the [scopes](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=connected_app_create_api_integration.htm&type=5&language=en_US) mentioned below are selected for the [!DNL Salesforce connected app].

* ``chatter_api``
* ``lightning``
* ``visualforce``
* ``content``
* ``openid``
* ``full``
* ``api``
* ``web``
* ``refresh_token``
* ``offline_access``

Finally, ensure that the `password` grant is enabled within your [!DNL Salesforce] account. Refer to the [!DNL Salesforce] [OAuth 2.0 Username-Password Flow for Special Scenarios](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.remoteaccess_oauth_username_password_flow.htm&type=5) documentation if you need guidance.

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>If your [!DNL Salesforce] account administrator has restricted access to trusted IP ranges, you need to contact them to get [Experience Platform IP's](/help/destinations/catalog/streaming/ip-address-allow-list.md) allowlisted. Refer to the [!DNL Salesforce] [Restrict Access to Trusted IP Ranges for a Connected App](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.connected_app_edit_ip_ranges.htm&type=5) documentation if you need additional guidance.

#### Create custom fields within [!DNL Salesforce] {#prerequisites-custom-field}

When activating audiences to the [!DNL Salesforce CRM] destination, you must input a value in the **[!UICONTROL Mapping ID]** field for each activated audience, in the **[Audience schedule](#schedule-segment-export-example)** step.

[!DNL Salesforce CRM] requires this value to correctly read and interpret audiences coming in from Experience Platform and to update their audience status within [!DNL Salesforce]. Refer to the Experience Platform documentation for [Audience Membership Details schema field group](/help/xdm/field-groups/profile/segmentation.md) if you need guidance on audience statuses.

For each audience that you activate from Platform to [!DNL Salesforce CRM], you need to create a custom field of the type `Text Area (Long)` within [!DNL Salesforce]. You can define the field character length of any size between 256 - 131,072 characters according to your business requirement. See the [!DNL Salesforce] [Custom Field Types](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.custom_field_types.htm&type=5) documentation page for additional information on custom field types. Also refer the [!DNL Salesforce] documentation to [create custom fields](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=mc_cab_create_an_attribute.htm&type=5&language=en_US) if you need assistance on field creation.

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>Do not include whitespace characters in the field name. Instead, use the underscore `(_)` character as a separator.
>Within [!DNL Salesforce] you must create custom fields with a **[!UICONTROL Field Name]** that exactly matches the value specified within **[!UICONTROL Mapping ID]** for each activated Platform segment. For example, the screenshot below shows a custom field named `crm_2_seg`. When activating an audience to this destination, add `crm_2_seg` as **[!UICONTROL Mapping ID]** to populate audience audiences from Experience Platform into this custom field.

An example of custom field creation in [!DNL Salesforce], *Step 1 - Select the data type*, is shown below:
![Salesforce UI screenshot showing custom field creation, Step 1 - Select the data type.](../../assets/catalog/crm/salesforce/create-salesforce-custom-field-step-1.png)

An example of custom field creation in [!DNL Salesforce], *Step 2 - Enter the details for the custom field*, is shown below:
![Salesforce UI screenshot showing custom field creation, Step 2 - Enter the details for the custom field.](../../assets/catalog/crm/salesforce/create-salesforce-custom-field-step-2.png)

>[!TIP]
>
>* To distinguish between custom fields used for Platform audiences and other custom fields within [!DNL Salesforce] you could include a recognizable prefix or suffix when creating the custom field. For example, instead of `test_segment`, use `Adobe_test_segment` or `test_segment_Adobe`
>* If you already have other custom fields created in [!DNL Salesforce], you can use the same name as the Platform segment, to easily identify the audience in [!DNL Salesforce].

>[!NOTE]
>
>* Objects in Salesforce are restricted to 25 External fields, see [Custom Field Attributes](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.custom_field_attributes.htm&type=5).
>* This restriction implies that you can only have a maximum of 25 Experience Platform audience memberships active at any time. 
>* If you have reached this limit within Salesforce, you must remove the custom attributes from Salesforce that were used to store the audience status against older audiences within Experience Platform before a new **[!UICONTROL Mapping ID]** can be used.

#### Gather [!DNL Salesforce CRM] credentials {#gather-credentials}

Read [Activate profiles and audiences to streaming audience export destinations](/help/destinations/ui/activate-segment-streaming-destinations.md) for instructions on activating audiences to this destination.

### Mapping considerations and example {#mapping-considerations-example}

To correctly send your audience data from Adobe Experience Platform to the [!DNL Salesforce CRM] destination, you need to go through the field mapping step. Mapping consists of creating a link between your Experience Data Model (XDM) schema fields in your Platform account and their corresponding equivalents from the target destination.

Attributes specified in the **[!UICONTROL Target field]** should be named exactly as described in the attribute mappings table as these attributes will form the request body.

Attributes specified in the **[!UICONTROL Source field]** do not follow any such restriction. You can map it based on your need, however ensure the format of the input data is valid according to the [[!DNL Salesforce] documentation](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.custom_field_attributes.htm&type=5). If the input data is not valid, the update call to [!DNL Salesforce] will fail and your contacts / leads would not get updated.

To correctly map your XDM fields to the [!DNL (API) Salesforce CRM] destination fields, follow these steps:

1. In the **[!UICONTROL Mapping]** step, select **[!UICONTROL Add new mapping]**, you will see a new mapping row on the screen.
![Platform UI screenshot example for Add new mapping.](../../assets/catalog/crm/salesforce/add-new-mapping.png)
1. In the **[!UICONTROL Select source field]** window, choose the **[!UICONTROL Select attributes]** category and select the XDM attribute or choose the **[!UICONTROL Select identity namespace]** and select an identity.
1. In the **[!UICONTROL Select target field]** window, choose the **[!UICONTROL Select identity namespace]** and select an identity or choose **[!UICONTROL Select custom attributes]** category and select an attribute or define one using the **[!UICONTROL Attribute name]** field as needed. Refer to the [[!DNL Salesforce CRM] documentation](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.custom_field_attributes.htm&type=5) for guidance on supported attributes.
    * Repeat these steps to add the following mappings between your XDM profile schema and [!DNL (API) Salesforce CRM]:

    **Working with Contacts**

    * If you are working with *Contacts* within your segment, refer to the Object Reference in Salesforce for [Contact](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.object_reference.meta/object_reference/sforce_api_objects_contact.htm) to define mappings for the fields to be updated.
    * You can identify mandatory fields by searching for the word *Required*, which is mentioned in field descriptions in the link above.
    * Depending on the fields you want to export or update, add mappings between your XDM profile schema and [!DNL (API) Salesforce CRM]:
        |Source Field|Target Field| Notes |
        | --- | --- | --- |
        |`IdentityMap: crmID`|`Identity: SalesforceId`|`Mandatory`|
        |`xdm: person.name.lastName`|`Attribute: LastName`| `Mandatory`. Last name of the contact up to 80 characters. |    
        |`xdm: person.name.firstName`|`Attribute: FirstName`| The contact's first name up to 40 characters. |
        |`xdm: personalEmail.address`|`Attribute: Email`| The contact's email address. |

    * An example using these mappings is shown below:
    ![Platform UI screenshot example showing Target mappings.](../../assets/catalog/crm/salesforce/mappings-contacts.png)

    **Working with Leads**

    * If you are working with *Leads* within your segment, refer to the Object Reference in Salesforce for [Lead](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.object_reference.meta/object_reference/sforce_api_objects_lead.htm) to define mappings for the fields to be updated.
    * You can identify mandatory fields by searching for the word *Required*, which is mentioned in field descriptions in the link above.
    * Depending on the fields you want to export or update, add mappings between your XDM profile schema and [!DNL (API) Salesforce CRM]:
        |Source Field|Target Field| Notes |
        | --- | --- | --- |
        |`IdentityMap: crmID`|`Identity: SalesforceId`|`Mandatory`|
        |`xdm: person.name.lastName`|`Attribute: LastName`| `Mandatory`. Last name of the lead up to 80 characters. |    
        |`xdm: b2b.companyName`|`Attribute: Company`| `Mandatory`. The lead's company. |
        |`xdm: personalEmail.address`|`Attribute: Email`| The lead's email address. |

    * An example using these mappings is shown below:
    ![Platform UI screenshot example showing Target mappings.](../../assets/catalog/crm/salesforce/mappings-leads.png)    

When you have finished providing the mappings for your destination connection, select **[!UICONTROL Next]**.

### Schedule audience export and example {#schedule-segment-export-example}

When performing the [Schedule audience export](/help/destinations/ui/activate-segment-streaming-destinations.md#scheduling) step you must manually map audiences activated from Platform to their corresponding custom field in [!DNL Salesforce].

To do this, select each segment, then enter the custom field name from [!DNL Salesforce] in the [!DNL Salesforce CRM] **[!UICONTROL Mapping ID]** field. Refer to the [Create custom fields within [!DNL Salesforce]](#prerequisites-custom-field) section for guidance and best practices on creating custom fields in [!DNL Salesforce].

For example, if your [!DNL Salesforce] custom field is `crm_2_seg`, specify this value in the [!DNL Salesforce CRM] **[!UICONTROL Mapping ID]** to populate audience audiences from Experience Platform into this custom field.

An example custom field from [!DNL Salesforce] is shown below:
![[!DNL Salesforce] UI screenshot showing custom field.](../../assets/catalog/crm/salesforce/salesforce-custom-field.png)

An example indicating the location of the [!DNL Salesforce CRM] **[!UICONTROL Mapping ID]** is shown below:
![Platform UI screenshot example showing Schedule audience export.](../../assets/catalog/crm/salesforce/schedule-segment-export.png)

As shown above the [!DNL Salesforce] **[!UICONTROL Field Name]** exactly matches the value specified within [!DNL Salesforce CRM] **[!UICONTROL Mapping ID]**.

Depending on your use case, all activated audiences can be mapped to the same [!DNL Salesforce] custom field or to different **[!UICONTROL Field Name]** in [!DNL Salesforce CRM]. A typical example based on the image shown above could be.
| [!DNL Salesforce CRM] segment name | [!DNL Salesforce] **[!UICONTROL Field Name]** | [!DNL Salesforce CRM] **[!UICONTROL Mapping ID]** | 
| --- | --- | --- |
| crm_1_seg | `crm_1_seg` | `crm_1_seg` |
| crm_2_seg | `crm_2_seg` | `crm_2_seg` |

Repeat this section for each activated Platform segment.

## Validate data export {#exported-data}

To validate that you have correctly set up the destination, follow the steps below:

1. Select **[!UICONTROL Destinations]** > **[!UICONTROL Browse]** to navigate to the list of destinations.
![Platform UI screenshot showing Browse Destinations.](../../assets/catalog/crm/salesforce/browse-destinations.png)

1. Select the destination and validate that the status is **[!UICONTROL enabled]**.
![Platform UI screenshot showing Destinations Dataflow Run.](../../assets/catalog/crm/salesforce/destination-dataflow-run.png)

1. Switch to the **[!UICONTROL Activation data]** tab, then select an audience name.
![Platform UI screenshot example showing Destinations Activation Data.](../../assets/catalog/crm/salesforce/destinations-activation-data.png)

1. Monitor the audience summary and ensure that the count of profiles corresponds to the count created within the segment.
![Platform UI screenshot example showing Segment.](../../assets/catalog/crm/salesforce/segment.png)

1. Finally, log in to the Salesforce website and validate if the profiles from the audience have been added or updated.

    **Working with Contacts**

    * If you have selected *Contacts* within your Platform segment, navigate to the **[!DNL Apps]** > **[!DNL Contacts]** page.
    ![Salesforce CRM screenshot showing the Contacts page with the profiles from the segment.](../../assets/catalog/crm/salesforce/contacts.png)

    * Select a *Contact* and check if the fields are updated. You can see that each audience status in [!DNL Salesforce CRM] was updated with the corresponding audience status from Platform, based on the **[!UICONTROL Mapping ID]** value provided during the [audience scheduling](#schedule-segment-export-example).
    ![Salesforce CRM screenshot showing the Contact Details page with updated audience statuses.](../../assets/catalog/crm/salesforce/contact-info.png)

    **Working with Leads**

    * If you have selected *Leads* within your Platform segment, then navigate to the **[!DNL Apps]** > **[!DNL Leads]** page.
    ![Salesforce CRM screenshot showing the Leads page with the profiles from the segment.](../../assets/catalog/crm/salesforce/leads.png)

    * Select a *Lead* and check if the fields are updated. You can see that each audience status in [!DNL Salesforce CRM] was updated with the corresponding audience status from Platform, based on the **[!UICONTROL Mapping ID]** value provided during the [audience scheduling](#schedule-segment-export-example).
    ![Salesforce CRM screenshot showing the Lead Details page with updated audience statuses.](../../assets/catalog/crm/salesforce/lead-info.png)
