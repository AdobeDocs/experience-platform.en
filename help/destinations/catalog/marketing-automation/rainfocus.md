# RainFocus {#rainfocus-destination}

## Overview {#overview}

Use the RainFocus destination to stream customer profiles from Adobe Experience Platform into the RainFocus platform in order to create and update attendee profiles.

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>The destination connector and documentation page are created and maintained by the RainFocus team. For any inquiries or update requests, please contact them directly at clientcare@rainfocus.com or visit the RainFocus [Help Center](https://help.rainfocus.com/hc/en-us).

## Use cases {#use-cases}

To help you better understand how and when you should use the RainFocus destination, here are sample use cases that Adobe Experience Platform customers can solve by using this destination.

### Use case #1 {#use-case-1}

A large enterprise technology company is due to open registration for its upcoming global expo and would like to push customer profiles to RainFocus in order to streamline the registration process.

### Use case #2 {#use-case-2}

A financial services brand is due to host a series of roadshows targeting new and existing customers. They have a series of audience segments with target customers in Adobe Experience Platform. Using the RainFocus Destination Connector, they are able to easily send those profiles to RainFocus for activation.

## Prerequisites {#prerequisites}

Before you can use the RainFocus destination, make sure to meet the following prerequisites:
  
* Create a RainFocus API Profile with OAuth (Global). 
  * The **Attendee Store** endpoint must be enabled. 
  * A **Client ID** and **Client Secret** will need to be generated.

You must also have a RainFocus **event code** identifier, into which you would like profiles sent to.

## Supported identities {#supported-identities}

RainFocus supports the activation of identities described in the table below. Learn more about [identities](/help/identity-service/namespaces.md).

|Target Identity|Description|Considerations|
|---|---|---|
|email_lc_sha256|Email addresses hashed with the SHA256 algorithm|Both plain text and SHA256 hashed email addresses are supported by Adobe Experience Platform. When your source field contains unhashed attributes, check the **[!UICONTROL Apply transformation]** option, to have [!DNL Platform] automatically hash the data on activation.|

## Supported audiences {#supported-audiences}

This section describes which type of audiences you can export to this destination.

| Audience origin | Supported | Description | 
---------|----------|----------|
| [!DNL Segmentation Service] | ✓ | Audiences generated through the Experience Platform [Segmentation Service](../../../segmentation/home.md).|
| Custom uploads | ✓ | Audiences [imported](../../../segmentation/ui/overview.md#import-audience) into Experience Platform from CSV files. |

## Export type and frequency {#export-type-frequency}

Refer to the table below for information about the destination export type and frequency.

| Item | Type | Notes |
---------|----------|---------|
| Export type | **[!UICONTROL Profile-based]** | You are exporting all members of a segment, together with the desired schema fields (for example: email address, phone number, last name), as chosen in the select profile attributes screen of the [destination activation workflow](/help/destinations/ui/activate-batch-profile-destinations.md#select-attributes).|
| Export frequency | **[!UICONTROL Streaming]** | Streaming destinations are "always on" API-based connections. As soon as a profile is updated in Experience Platform based on segment evaluation, the connector sends the update downstream to the destination platform. Read more about [streaming destinations](/help/destinations/destination-types.md#streaming-destinations).|
