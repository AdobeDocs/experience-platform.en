## Overview {#overview}

[Gainsight PX](https://www.gainsight.com/product-experience/) is a product experience platform that enables product teams to understand how users use their products, collect feedback, and create in-app engagements like product walkthroughs to drive user onboarding and product adoption.

## Supported audiences {#supported-audiences}

This section describes which type of audiences you can export to this destination.

| Audience origin | Supported | Description | 
---------|----------|----------|
| [!DNL Segmentation Service] | âœ“ | Audiences generated through the Experience Platform [Segmentation Service](../../../segmentation/home.md).|
| Custom uploads | X | Audiences [imported](../../../segmentation/ui/overview.md#import-audience) into Experience Platform from CSV files. |

## Export type and frequency {#export-type-frequency}

Refer to the table below for information about the destination export type and frequency.

| Item | Type | Notes |
---------|----------|---------|
| Export type | **[!UICONTROL Segment export]** | You are exporting all members of a segment (audience) with the identifiers (name, phone number, or others) used in the *YourDestination* destination.|
| Export frequency | **[!UICONTROL Streaming]** | Streaming destinations are "always on" API-based connections. As soon as a profile is updated in Experience Platform based on segment evaluation, the connector sends the update downstream to the destination platform. Read more about [streaming destinations](/help/destinations/destination-types.md#streaming-destinations).|

Read the [access control overview](/help/access-control/ui/overview.md) or contact your product administrator to obtain the required permissions.
>* To export *identities*, you need the **[!UICONTROL View Identity Graph]** [access control permission](/help/access-control/home.md#permissions). <br> ![Select identity namespace highlighted in the workflow to activate audiences to destinations.](/help/destinations/assets/overview/export-identities-to-destination.png "Select identity namespace highlighted in the workflow to activate audiences to destinations."){width="100" zoomable="yes"}

Read [Activate profiles and segments to streaming segment export destinations](/help/destinations/ui/activate-segment-streaming-destinations.md) for instructions on activating audience segments to this destination.

### Map attributes and identities {#map}

The only relevant mapping is between the Adobe identity and the Gainsight PX identity.  Choose the appropriate identity source field on the Adobe side and map it to the IDENTIFY_ID (the only choice) field on the target side.  It is important that the source field have the exact same value that is passed during the Gainsight PX identify step.
![Example showing the identity mapping](../../assets/catalog/analytics/gainsight_px/mapping_identities.png)

## Exported data / Validate data export {#exported-data}

Segmentation data is streamed from the Adobe environment to Gainsight PX.  
Segment metadata will be visible in the Segments screen within the PX application:![Segments screen](../../assets/catalog/analytics/gainsight_px/segment_metadata.png)  
Segment membership information will be visible on the Segments tab of the Audience Explorer screen within PX: ![Audience Explorer](../../assets/catalog/analytics/gainsight_px/PX_Segments.png)
