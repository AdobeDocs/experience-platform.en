# (Beta) Data Landing Zone destination

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>* This destination is currently in Beta and is only available to a limited number of customers. To request access to the [!DNL Data Landing Zone] connection, contact your Adobe representative and provide your [!DNL Organization ID].
>* This documentation page refers to the [!DNL Data Landing Zone] *destination*. There is also a [!DNL Data Landing Zone] *source* in the sources catalog. For more information, read the [[!DNL Data Landing Zone] source](/help/sources/connectors/cloud-storage/data-landing-zone.md) documentation.


## Overview {#overview}

[!DNL Data Landing Zone] is an [!DNL Azure Blob] storage interface provisioned by Adobe Experience Platform, granting you access to a secure, cloud-based file storage facility to export files out of Platform. You have access to one [!DNL Data Landing Zone] container per sandbox, and the total data volume across all containers is limited to the total data provided with your Platform Products and Services license. All customers of Platform and its application services such as [!DNL Customer Journey Analytics], [!DNL Journey Orchestration], [!DNL Intelligent Services], and [!DNL Real-Time Customer Data Platform] are provisioned with one [!DNL Data Landing Zone] container per sandbox. You can read and write files to your container through [!DNL Azure Storage Explorer] or your command-line interface.

[!DNL Data Landing Zone] supports SAS-based authentication and its data is protected with standard [!DNL Azure Blob] storage security mechanisms at rest and in transit. SAS-based authentication allows you to securely access your [!DNL Data Landing Zone] container through a public internet connection. There are no network changes required for you to access your [!DNL Data Landing Zone] container, which means you do not need to configure any allow lists or cross-region setups for your network. 

Platform enforces a strict seven-day time-to-live (TTL) on all files uploaded to a [!DNL Data Landing Zone] container. All files are deleted after seven days.
