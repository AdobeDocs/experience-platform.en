# Snowflake connection {#snowflake-destination}

Export data to your Snowflake account using private listings.

## Overview {#overview}

Export data to your Snowflake account using private listings.

## Use cases {#use-cases}

To help you better understand how and when you should use the *YourDestination* destination, here are sample use cases that Adobe Experience Platform customers can solve by using this destination.

### Use case #1 {#use-case-1}

*For mobile messaging platforms:*

*A home rental and sales platform wants to push mobile notifications to customers' Android and iOS devices to let them know that there are 100 updated listings in the area where they previously searched for a rental.*

### Use case #2 {#use-case-2}

*For social network platforms:*

*An athletic apparel brand wants to reach existing customers through their social media accounts. The apparel brand can ingest email addresses from their own CRM to Adobe Experience Platform, build audiences from their own offline data, and send these audiences to YourDestination, to display ads in their customers' social media feeds.*

## Prerequisites {#prerequisites}

*You can link out to your relevant documentation if that would be useful to customers.*
