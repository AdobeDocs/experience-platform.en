# SFTP connection

## Overview {#overview}

Create a live outbound connection to your SFTP server to periodically export delimited data files from Adobe Experience Platform.

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
> While Adobe supports data exports to SFTP servers, the recommended cloud storage locations to export data are [!DNL Amazon S3] and [!DNL Azure Blob].

## Export Type {#export-type}

**Profile-based** - you are exporting all members of a segment, together with the desired schema fields (for example: email address, phone number, last name), as chosen from the select attributes screen of the [destination activation workflow](../../ui/activate-batch-profile-destinations.md).

## Connect to the destination {#connect}

To connect to this destination, follow the steps described in the [destination configuration tutorial](../../ui/connect-destination.md).

### Connection parameters {#parameters}

While [setting up](../../ui/connect-destination.md) this destination, you must provide the following information:

* **Host**: The address of your SFTP storage location
* **Username**: The username to log into your SFTP storage location
* **Password**: The password to log into your SFTP storage location
* **[!UICONTROL Name]**: enter a name that will help you identify this destination.
* **[!UICONTROL Description]**: enter a description of this destination.
* **[!UICONTROL Folder path]**: enter the path to the destination folder that will host the exported files.

Optionally, you can attach your RSA-formatted public key to add encryption to your exported files. Your public key must be written as a [!DNL Base64] encoded string.

## Exported data {#exported-data}

For [!DNL SFTP] destinations, Platform creates a tab-delimited `.csv` file in the storage location that you provided. For more information about the files, see [Activate audience data to batch profile export destinations](../../ui/activate-batch-profile-destinations.md) in the segment activation tutorial.

## IP address allow list

Refer to [IP address allow list for cloud storage destinations](ip-address-allow-list.md) if you need to add Adobe IPs to an allow list.
