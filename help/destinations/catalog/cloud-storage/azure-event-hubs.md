# (Beta) [!DNL Azure Event Hubs] connection

## Overview {#overview}

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>The [!DNL Azure Event Hubs] destination in Platform is currently in beta. The documentation and the functionality are subject to change.

[!DNL Azure Event Hubs] is a big data streaming platform and event ingestion service. It can receive and process millions of events per second. Data sent to an event hub can be transformed and stored by using any real-time analytics provider or batching/storage adapters.

You can create a real-time outbound connection to your [!DNL Azure Event Hubs] storage to stream data from Adobe Experience Platform.

* For more information about [!DNL Azure Event Hubs], see the [Microsoft documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/event-hubs/event-hubs-about).
* To connect to [!DNL Azure Event Hubs] programmatically, see the [Streaming destinations API tutorial](../../api/streaming-destinations.md).
* To connect to [!DNL Azure Event Hubs] using the Platform user interface, see the sections below.

## Use Cases {#use-cases}

By using streaming destinations such as [!DNL Azure Event Hubs], you can easily feed high-value segmentation events and associated profile attributes into your systems of choice.

For example, a prospect downloaded a white-paper which qualifies them into a "high-propensity to convert" segment. By mapping the segment that the prospect falls in to the [!DNL Azure Event Hubs] destination, you would receive this event in [!DNL Azure Event Hubs]. There, you can employ a do-it-yourself approach and describe business logic on top of the event, as you think would work best with your enterprise IT systems.

## Export type {#export-type}

**Profile-based** - you are exporting all members of a segment, together with the desired schema fields (for example: email address, phone number, last name), as chosen from the select attributes screen of the [audience activation workflow](../../ui/activate-streaming-profile-destinations.md#select-attributes).

## Connect to the destination {#connect}

To connect to this destination, follow the steps described in the [destination configuration tutorial](../../ui/connect-destination.md).

### Connection parameters {#parameters}

While [setting up](../../ui/connect-destination.md) this destination, you must provide the following information:

* **[!UICONTROL SAS Key Name]** and **[!UICONTROL SAS Key]**: Fill in your SAS key name and key. Learn about authenticating to [!DNL Azure Event Hubs] with SAS keys in the [Microsoft documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/event-hubs/authenticate-shared-access-signature).
* **[!UICONTROL Namespace]**: Fill in your [!DNL Azure Event Hubs] namespace. Learn about [!DNL Azure Event Hubs] namespaces in the [Microsoft documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/event-hubs/event-hubs-create#create-an-event-hubs-namespace).
* **[!UICONTROL Name]**: Fill in a name for the connection to [!DNL Azure Event Hubs].
* **[!UICONTROL Description]**: Provide a description of the connection.  Examples: "Premium tier customers", "Males interested in kitesurfing".
* **[!UICONTROL eventHubName]**: Provide a name for the stream to your [!DNL Azure Event Hubs] destination.

## Activate segments to this destination {#activate}

See [Activate audience data to streaming profile export destinations](../../ui/activate-streaming-profile-destinations.md) for instructions on activating audience segments to this destination.

## Profile export behavior {#profile-export-behavior}

Experience Platform optimizes the profile export behavior to your Azure Event Hubs destination, to only export data to your destination when relevant updates to a profile have occurred following segment qualification or other significant events. Profiles are exported to your destination in the following situations:

* The profile update was triggered by a change in segment membership for at least one of the segments mapped to the destination. For example, the profile has qualified for one of the segments mapped to the destination or has exited one of the segments mapped to the destination.
* The profile update was triggered by a change in the [identity map](/help/xdm/field-groups/profile/identitymap.md). For example, a profile who had already qualified for one of the segments mapped to the destination has been added a new identity in the identity map attribute.
* The profile update was triggered by a change in attributes for at least one of the attributes mapped to the destination. For example, one of the attributes mapped to the destination in the mapping step is added to a profile.

In all the cases described above, only the profiles where relevant updates have occurred are exported to your destination. For example, if a segment mapped to the destination flow has a hundred members, and five new profiles qualify for the segment, the export to your destination is incremental and only includes the five new profiles.

Note that the all the mapped attributes are exported for a profile, no matter where the changes lie. So, in the example above all the mapped attributes for those five new profiles will be exported even if the attributes themselves haven't changed.

## Exported data {#exported-data}

Your exported [!DNL Experience Platform] data lands in [!DNL Azure Event Hubs] in JSON format. For example, the event below contains the email address profile attribute of an audience that has qualified for a certain segment and exited another segment. The identities for this prospect are ECID and email.

```json
{
  "person": {
    "birthDate": "YYYY-MM-DD",
    "name": {
      "firstName": "John",
      "lastName": "Doe"
    }
  },
