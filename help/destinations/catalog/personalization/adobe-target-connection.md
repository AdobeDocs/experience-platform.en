## Overview {#overview}

Adobe Target is an application that provides real-time, AI-powered personalization and experimentation capabilities in all inbound customer interactions across websites, mobile apps, and more.

Adobe Target is a personalization connection in the Adobe Experience Platform destinations catalog.

## Video overview {#video-overview}

For a brief overview on how to configure the Adobe Target connection in Experience Platform, watch the video below.

>[!VIDEO](https://video.tv.adobe.com/v/3418799/?quality=12&learn=on)

## Prerequisites {#prerequisites}

### Datastream ID {#datastream-id}

When configuring the Adobe Target connection to [use a datastream ID](#parameters), you must have the [Adobe Experience Platform Web SDK](../../../edge/home.md) implemented.

Configuring the Adobe Target connection without using a datastream ID does not require you to implement the Web SDK.

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>Before creating an [!DNL Adobe Target] connection, read the guide on how to [configure personalization destinations for same-page and next-page personalization](../../ui/activate-edge-personalization-destinations.md). This guide takes you through the required configuration steps for same-page and next-page personalization use cases, across multiple Experience Platform components. To achieve same-page and next-page personalization use cases, you must use a datastream ID when configuring the Adobe Target connection.

### Prerequisites in Adobe Target {#prerequisites-in-adobe-target}

In Adobe Target, make sure that your user has:

* Access to the [default workspace](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/target/using/administer/manage-users/enterprise/property-channel.html#default-workspace);
* The **Approver** [role](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/target/using/administer/manage-users/enterprise/property-channel.html#roles-and-permissions).

Read more about granting permissions for [Target Premium](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/target/using/administer/manage-users/enterprise/properties-overview.html#section_8C425E43E5DD4111BBFC734A2B7ABC80) and for [Target Standard](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/target/using/administer/manage-users/users/user-management.html#roles-permissions).

## Supported audiences {#supported-audiences}

This section describes which types of audiences you can export to this destination.

| Audience origin | Supported | Description | 
---------|----------|----------|
| [!DNL Segmentation Service] | âœ“ | Audiences generated through the Experience Platform [Segmentation Service](../../../segmentation/home.md).|
| Custom uploads | X | Audiences [imported](../../../segmentation/ui/overview.md#import-audience) into Experience Platform from CSV files. |

{style="table-layout:auto"}

## Export type and frequency {#export-type-frequency}

Refer to the table below for information about the destination export type and frequency.

| Item | Type | Notes |
---------|----------|---------|
| Export type | **[!DNL Profile request]** | You are requesting all the audiences that are mapped in the Adobe Target destination for a single profile.|
| Export frequency | **[!UICONTROL Streaming]** | Streaming destinations are "always on" API-based connections. As soon as a profile is updated in Experience Platform based on audience evaluation, the connector sends the update downstream to the destination platform. Read more about [streaming destinations](/help/destinations/destination-types.md#streaming-destinations).|

While [setting up](../../ui/connect-destination.md) this destination, you must provide the following information:

* **Name**: Fill in the preferred name for this destination.
* **Description**: Enter a description for your destination. For example, you can mention which campaign you are using this destination for. This field is optional.
* **Datastream ID**: This determines in which Data Collection datastream the audiences will be included. The drop-down menu shows only datastreams that have the Target and Adobe Experience Platform services enabled. See [configuring a datastream](../../../datastreams/configure.md#aep) for detailed information on how to configure a datastream for Adobe Experience Platform and Adobe Target.
    * **[!UICONTROL None]**: Select this option if you need to configure Adobe Target personalization but you cannot implement the [Experience Platform Web SDK](../../../edge/home.md). When using this option, audiences exported from Experience Platform to Target only support next-session personalization, and edge segmentation is disabled. See the table below for more information.
