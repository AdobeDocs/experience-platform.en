# [!DNL Algolia User Segments] connection

## Overview {#overview}

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>The [!DNL Algolia User Segments] destination connector and documentation page are created and maintained by the Algolia Integration Services team. For inquiries or update requests, contact them at [adobe-algolia-solutions@algolia.com](adobe-algolia-solutions@algolia.com).

Use the [!DNL Algolia User Segments] destination connection to send Adobe Experience Platform audiences to Algolia to personalize search and recommendations. This requires the use of the [!DNL Algolia User Profiles] source connector to pull user profiles from Algolia to help build rich audiences.

This tutorial provides steps to create an [!DNL Algolia User Segments] destination connection and dataflow using the Adobe Experience Platform user interface.

## Use cases {#use-cases}

To help you better understand how and when you should use the [!DNL Algolia User Segments] destination, here are sample use cases that Adobe Experience Platform customers can solve by using this destination.

### Personalization consistency {#personalization-consistency}

Use this destination connector to deliver a consistent personalization across your site from home page to search.  

For example, as a marketer, you might want to build rich audiences in Adobe Experience Platform from multiple user data sources, including Algolia. You can use the [!DNL Algolia User Segments] connector to share the audiences for targeting strategies, leading to a boost in campaign personalization and conversion.

To implement this use case, you must use both the [[!DNL Algolia] source](/help/sources/connectors/data-partners/algolia-user-profiles.md) and destination connectors.

You would start by importing your existing [!DNL Algolia] user profiles into Adobe Experience Platform Real-Time CDP and other sources to begin creating rich audiences with the source connector. Marketers would create audiences using the profile data that can be sent to Algolia for search and recommendation personalization.

Then, use the corresponding [[!DNL Algolia User Profiles]](/help/sources/connectors/data-partners/algolia-user-profiles.md) source connector to ingest and augment customer profiles back into Real-Time CDP.
