## Use cases 

To help you better understand how and when you should use the Customer Decision Hub destination, here are sample use cases that Adobe Experience Platform customers can solve by using this destination.

### Use case #1

### Telecommunications

A marketer wants to leverage insights from data science model-based next best action as delivered by Pega Customer Decision Hub for customer engagement. Pega Customer Decision Hub is heavily reliant on customer intent â€“ for example "Interested_In_5G", "Interested_in_Unlimited_Dataplan" or "Interest_in_iPhone_accessories".

### Use case #2

### Financial services

A marketer wants to optimize the offers for customers who subscribed or unsubscribed from Pension Plan or Retirement Plan newsletters. Financial services companies can ingest multiple Customer IDs from their own CRMs into Adobe Experience Platform, build segments from their own offline data, and send profiles that are entering and exiting the segments to Pega Customer Decision Hub for next-best-action (NBA) decisioning in outbound channels.
