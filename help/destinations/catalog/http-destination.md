# (Alpha) [!DNL HTTP] connection

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>The [!DNL HTTP] destination in Platform is currently in alpha. The documentation and the functionality are subject to change.

## Overview {#overview}

The [!DNL HTTP] destination is an [!DNL Adobe Experience Platform] streaming destination that helps you send profile data to third-party [!DNL HTTP] endpoints.

To send profile data to [!DNL HTTP] endpoints, you must first connect to the destination in [[!DNL Adobe Experience Platform]](#connect-destination).

## Use cases {#use-cases}

The [!DNL HTTP] destination is targeted towards customers who need to export XDM profile data and audience segments to generic [!DNL HTTP] endpoints.

[!DNL HTTP] endpoints can be either customers' own systems  or third-party solutions.

## Connect to the destination {#connect}

To connect to this destination, follow the steps described in the [destination configuration tutorial](../ui/connect-destination.md).

### Connection parameters {#parameters}

While [setting up](../ui/connect-destination.md) this destination, you must provide the following information:

* **[!UICONTROL httpEndpoint]**: the [!DNL URL] of the HTTP endpoint that you want to send the profile data to.
  * Optionally, you can add query parameters to the [!UICONTROL httpEndpoint] [!DNL URL].
* **[!UICONTROL authEndpoint]**: the [!DNL URL] of the HTTP endpoint used for [!DNL OAuth2] authentication.
* **[!UICONTROL Client ID]**: the [!DNL clientID] parameter used in the [!DNL OAuth2] client credentials.
* **[!UICONTROL Client Secret]**: the [!DNL clientSecret] parameter used in the [!DNL OAuth2] client credentials.

  >[!NOTE]
  >
  >Only [!DNL OAuth2] client credentials are currently supported.

* **[!UICONTROL Name]**: enter a name by which you will recognize this destination in the future.
* **[!UICONTROL Description]**: enter a description that will help you identify this destination in the future.
* **[!UICONTROL Custom Headers]**: enter any custom headers that you want to be included in the destination calls, following this format: `header1:value1,header2:value2,...headerN:valueN`.

  >[!IMPORTANT]
  >
  >The current implementation requires at least one custom header. This limitation will be resolved in a future update.

## Activate segments to this destination {#activate}

See [Activate audience data to streaming profile export destinations](../ui/activate-streaming-profile-destinations.md) for instructions on activating audience segments to this destination.

### Destination attributes {#attributes}

In the [[!UICONTROL Select attributes]](../ui/activate-streaming-profile-destinations.md#select-attributes) step, Adobe recommends that you select a unique identifier from your [union schema](../../profile/home.md#profile-fragments-and-union-schemas). Select the unique identifier and any other XDM fields that you want to export to the destination.

## Exported data {#exported-data}

Your exported [!DNL Experience Platform] data lands in your [!DNL HTTP] destination in JSON format. For example, the event below contains the email address profile attribute of an audience that has qualified for a certain segment and exited another segment. The identities for this prospect are [!DNL ECID] and email.
