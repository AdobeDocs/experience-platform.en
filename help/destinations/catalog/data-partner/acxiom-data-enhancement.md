# [!DNL Acxiom Data Enhancement] destination connection

>[!NOTE]
>
>The [!DNL Acxiom Data Enhancement] destination is in beta.  This destination connector and documentation page are created and maintained by the Acxiom team. For any inquiries or update requests, please contact them directly at acxiom-adobe-help@acxiom.com.

## Overview {#overview}

Use the [!DNL Acxiom Data Enhancement] connector to supply additional descriptive data to your customer profiles, for use in analytics, segmentation, and targeting applications. With hundreds of elements available, this allows you to better segment and model data, resulting in more accurate targeting and predictive modeling.

![Marketing diagram to export first-party data to Acxiom, then import enriched data back into Real-Time CDP](/help/destinations/assets/catalog/data-partner/acxiom/marketing-workflow-data-enhancement.png)

This tutorial provides steps to create an [!DNL Acxiom Data Enhancement] destination connection and dataflow using the Adobe Experience Platform user interface. This connector is used to deliver data to Acxiom enhancement service using Amazon S3 as a drop point.

## Use cases {#use-cases}

To help you better understand how and when you should use the [!DNL Acxiom Data Enhancement] destination, here are sample use cases that Adobe Experience Platform customers can solve by using this destination.

### Enhance Customer data {#enhance-customer-data}

This connector should be used by marketing professionals aiming to enhance the effectiveness of their outreach strategies by appending selected descriptive elements to their customer profiles and use these to better target campaigns.

For example, as a marketer, you might want to deepen your understanding of your existing audiences by enriching their profiles with additional data. Doing so will improve your segmentation and targeting strategies, leading to a boost in campaign personalization and conversion.

The use case is executed through a combination of both destination and source connectors.

You would start by exporting your existing customer records for enrichment using this destination connector. Acxiom's service would search for the file, retrieve it, enrich it with Acxiom's data and generate a file. 

The customer would then use the corresponding [Acxiom Data Ingestion](/help/sources/connectors/data-partners/acxiom-data-ingestion.md) source card to ingest the hydrated customer profiles back into Adobe Real-Time CDP.

### Mapping suggestions

The correct processing of files on the Acxiom side requires name and address elements. While not all elements are required, providing as much as possible will aid in successful matching.

Mapping suggestions are provided in the table below listing attributes on your destination side that are used by Acxiom processing that customers can map profile attributes to. Treat these elements as suggestions as not all elements are required and the source values will depend on the needs of the account.

| Target Field | Source Description                                          |
|--------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| name         | The `person.name.fullName` value in Experience Platform.      |
| firstName    | The `person.name.firstName` value in Experience Platform.     |
| lastName     | The `person.name.lastName` value in Experience Platform.      |
| address1     | The `mailingAddress.street1` value in Experience Platform.    |
| address2     | The `mailingAddress.street2` value in Experience Platform.    |
| city         | The `mailingAddress.city` value in Experience Platform.       |

>If you map additional fields not listed above in the dataflow, these will be included in the data export, but will be ignored by Acxiom processing.

## Validate data export {#exported-data}

To verify if data has been exported successfully, check your [!DNL Amazon S3 Storage] bucket and make sure that the exported files contain the expected profile populations.

## Next steps

By following this tutorial, you have successfully created a dataflow to export profile data from Experience Platform to your [!DNL Acxiom] managed S3 location. Next, you need to contact your Acxiom representative with the name of the account, file names, and the bucket path so that processing can set up.

## Data usage and governance {#data-usage-governance}

All [!DNL Adobe Experience Platform] destinations are compliant with data usage policies when handling your data. For detailed information on how [!DNL Adobe Experience Platform] enforces data governance, read the [Data Governance overview](/help/data-governance/home.md).
