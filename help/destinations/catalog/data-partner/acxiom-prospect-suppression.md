# [!DNL Acxiom Prospect-Suppression] destination connection

>[!NOTE]
>
>The [!DNL Acxiom Prospect-Suppression] destination is in beta. This destination connector and documentation page are created and maintained by the Acxiom team. For any inquiries or update requests, please contact them directly at acxiom-adobe-help@acxiom.com.

## Overview {#overview}

Use [!DNL Acxiom Prospect-Suppression] to deliver the most productive prospect audiences possible. This connector securely exports first party data from Real-Time Customer Data Platform and runs it through an award-winning hygiene and identity resolution which produces a data file to be used as a suppression list. This will be matched against the [!DNL Acxiom Global] database which enables the prospect lists to be tailored for import. Then, use the [[!DNL Acxiom Prospecting Data Import]](/help/sources/connectors/data-partners/acxiom-prospecting-data-import.md) source connector to prospect lists from Acxiom back into Real-Time CDP, with your known or converted customers removed. 

![Marketing diagram to export first-party data to Acxiom, then import prospect data back into Real-Time CDP](/help/destinations/assets/catalog/data-partner/acxiom/marketing-workflow.png)

Acxiom offers the industry's best-performing audiences with the largest catalog of over 12,000 global data attributes specifically focused on providing personalized experiences. Tap into limitless combinations of high-quality data to create and distribute audiences to meet specific campaign needs.

This tutorial provides steps to create an [!DNL Acxiom Prospect-Suppression] destination connection and dataflow using the Adobe Experience Platform user interface. This connector is used to deliver data to the Acxiom prospect service using Amazon S3 as a drop point. Contact your Acxiom account representative once you start exporting files to the Amazon S3 drop point.

## Use cases {#use-cases}

To help you better understand how and when you should use the [!DNL Acxiom Prospect-Suppression] destination, here are sample use cases that Adobe Experience Platform customers can solve by using this destination.

### Create a suppression list for prospecting datasets {#create-suppression-list}

Marketing professionals aiming to enhance the effectiveness of their outreach strategies often employ the creation of a suppression list. This list includes existing customers and specific segments, ensuring their exclusion from prospecting activities during targeted campaigns. This strategic approach helps refine the audience, avoids redundant communication, and contributes to a more focused and efficient marketing effort.

For example, as a marketer, you may want to broaden your campaign reach by adding targeted prospect profiles to your campaigns based on segmentation and suppression criteria that you have provided.

The use case is executed through a combination of both destination and source connectors.

You would initially start by exporting your existing customer profiles using this destination connector to be used as a suppression file. This ensures that no existing customer records are included.

Acxiom's service would search for the file, retrieve it and use it alongside additional selection criteria and generate a prospect file. You would then use the corresponding [[!DNL Acxiom Prospecting Data Import]](/help/sources/connectors/data-partners/acxiom-prospecting-data-import.md) source connector to ingest the prospect profiles into Adobe Real-Time CDP.
