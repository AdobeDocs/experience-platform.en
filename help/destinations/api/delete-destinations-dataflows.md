# Delete a destination dataflow using the Flow Service API

You can delete dataflows that contain errors or have become obsolete using the [[!DNL Flow Service] API](https://www.adobe.io/experience-platform-apis/references/flow-service/).

This tutorial covers the steps for deleting dataflows to both batch and streaming destinations using [!DNL Flow Service].

## Getting started {#get-started}

This tutorial requires you to have a valid flow ID. If you do not have a valid flow ID, select your destination of choice from the [destinations catalog](../catalog/overview.md) and follow the steps outlined to [connect to the destination](../ui/connect-destination.md) and [activate data](../ui/activation-overview.md) before attempting this tutorial.

This tutorial also requires you to have a working understanding of the following components of Adobe Experience Platform:

* [Destinations](../home.md): [!DNL Destinations] are pre-built integrations with destination platforms that allow for the seamless activation of data from Adobe Experience Platform. You can use destinations to activate your known and unknown data for cross-channel marketing campaigns, email campaigns, targeted advertising, and many other use cases.
* [Sandboxes](../../../sandboxes/home.md): [!DNL Experience Platform] provides virtual sandboxes which partition a single [!DNL Platform] instance into separate virtual environments to help develop and evolve digital experience applications.

The following sections provide additional information that you will need to know in order to successfully delete a dataflow using the [!DNL Flow Service] API.

### Reading sample API calls {#reading-sample-api-calls}

This tutorial provides example API calls to demonstrate how to format your requests. These include paths, required headers, and properly formatted request payloads. Sample JSON returned in API responses is also provided. For information on the conventions used in documentation for sample API calls, see the section on [how to read example API calls](../../../landing/troubleshooting.md#how-do-i-format-an-api-request) in the [!DNL Experience Platform] troubleshooting guide.

### Gather values for required headers {#gather-values-for-required-headers}

In order to make calls to [!DNL Platform] APIs, you must first complete the [authentication tutorial](https://www.adobe.com/go/platform-api-authentication-en). Completing the authentication tutorial provides the values for each of the required headers in all [!DNL Experience Platform] API calls, as shown below:

* `Authorization: Bearer {ACCESS_TOKEN}`
* `x-api-key: {API_KEY}`
* `x-gw-ims-org-id: {IMS_ORG}`

All resources in [!DNL Experience Platform], including those belonging to [!DNL Flow Service], are isolated to specific virtual sandboxes. All requests to [!DNL Platform] APIs require a header that specifies the name of the sandbox the operation will take place in:

* `x-sandbox-name: {SANDBOX_NAME}`

All requests that contain a payload (POST, PUT, PATCH) require an additional media type header:

* `Content-Type: application/json`

## Delete a destination dataflow {#delete-destination-dataflow}

With an existing flow ID, you can delete a destination dataflow by performing a DELETE request to the [!DNL Flow Service] API.

**API format**

```http
DELETE /flows/{FLOW_ID}
```

| Parameter | Description |
| --------- | ----------- |
| `{FLOW_ID}` | The unique `id` value for the destination dataflow you want to delete. |

**Request**

```shell
curl -X DELETE \
    'https://platform.adobe.io/data/foundation/flowservice/flows/455fa81b-f290-4222-94b6-540a73e3fbc2' \
    -H 'Authorization: Bearer {ACCESS_TOKEN}' \
    -H 'x-api-key: {API_KEY}' \
    -H 'x-gw-ims-org-id: {IMS_ORG}' \
    -H 'x-sandbox-name: {SANDBOX_NAME}'
```

**Response**

A successful response returns HTTP status 202 (No Content) and a blank body. You can confirm the deletion by attempting a lookup (GET) request to the dataflow. The API will return an HTTP 404 (Not Found) error, indicating that the dataflow has been deleted.

## Next steps {#next-steps}

By following this tutorial, you have successfully used the [!DNL Flow Service] API to delete an existing dataflow to a destination.

For steps on how to perform these operations using the user interface, please refer to the tutorial on [deleting dataflows in the UI](../ui/delete-destinations.md).
