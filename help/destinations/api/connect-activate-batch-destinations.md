# Connect to file-based email marketing destinations and activate data using the Flow Service API

>[!IMPORTANT]
> 
>* To connect to a destination, you need the **[!UICONTROL View Destinations]** and **[!UICONTROL Manage Destinations]** [access control permissions](/help/access-control/home.md#permissions). 
>
>* To activate data, you need the **[!UICONTROL View Destinations]**, **[!UICONTROL Activate Destinations]**, **[!UICONTROL View Profiles]**, and **[!UICONTROL View Segments]** [access control permissions](/help/access-control/home.md#permissions).
>
>* To export *identities*, you need the **[!UICONTROL View Identity Graph]** [access control permission](/help/access-control/home.md#permissions). <br> ![Select identity namespace highlighted in the workflow to activate audiences to destinations.](/help/destinations/assets/overview/export-identities-to-destination.png "Select identity namespace highlighted in the workflow to activate audiences to destinations."){width="100" zoomable="yes"}
>
>Read the [access control overview](/help/access-control/ui/overview.md) or contact your product administrator to obtain the required permissions.

This tutorial demonstrates how to use the Flow Service API to create a file-based [email marketing destination](../catalog/email-marketing/overview.md), create a dataflow to your newly created destination, and export data to your newly created destination via CSV files.

>[!TIP]
> 
>To learn how to activate data to cloud storage destinations using the Flow Service API, read the [dedicated API tutorial](/help/destinations/api/activate-segments-file-based-destinations.md).

This tutorial uses the [!DNL Adobe Campaign] destination in all examples, but the steps are identical for file-based email marketing destinations.

![Overview - the steps to create a destination and activate audiences](../assets/api/email-marketing/overview.png)

If you prefer to use the Platform user interface to connect to a destination and activate data, see the [Connect a destination](../ui/connect-destination.md) and [Activate audience data to batch profile export destinations](../ui/activate-batch-profile-destinations.md) tutorials.

## Getting started {#get-started}

This guide requires a working understanding of the following components of Adobe Experience Platform:

*   [[!DNL Experience Data Model (XDM) System]](../../xdm/home.md): The standardized framework by which [!DNL Experience Platform] organizes customer experience data.
*   [[!DNL Segmentation Service]](../../segmentation/api/overview.md): [!DNL Adobe Experience Platform Segmentation Service] allows you to build audiences in [!DNL Adobe Experience Platform] from your [!DNL Real-Time Customer Profile] data.
*   [[!DNL Sandboxes]](../../sandboxes/home.md): [!DNL Experience Platform] provides virtual sandboxes which partition a single [!DNL Platform] instance into separate virtual environments to help develop and evolve digital experience applications.

The following sections provide additional information that you need to know in order to activate data to batch destinations in Platform.

### Gather required credentials {#gather-required-credentials}

To complete the steps in this tutorial, you should have the following credentials ready, depending on the type of destination that you are connecting and activating audiences to.

* For [!DNL Amazon S3] connections: `accessId`, `secretKey`
* For [!DNL Amazon S3] connections to [!DNL Adobe Campaign]: `accessId`, `secretKey`
* For SFTP connections: `domain`, `port`, `username`, `password` or `sshKey` (depending on the connection method to the FTP location)
* For [!DNL Azure Blob] connections: `connectionString`

>[!NOTE]
>
>The credentials `accessId`, `secretKey` for [!DNL Amazon S3] connections and `accessId`, `secretKey` for [!DNL Amazon S3] connections to [!DNL Adobe Campaign] are identical.

### Reading sample API calls {#reading-sample-api-calls}

This tutorial provides example API calls to demonstrate how to format your requests. These include paths, required headers, and properly formatted request payloads. Sample JSON returned in API responses is also provided. For information on the conventions used in documentation for sample API calls, see the section on [how to read example API calls](../../landing/troubleshooting.md#how-do-i-format-an-api-request) in the [!DNL Experience Platform] troubleshooting guide.

### Gather values for required and optional headers {#gather-values-headers}

In order to make calls to [!DNL Platform] APIs, you must first complete the [authentication tutorial](https://www.adobe.com/go/platform-api-authentication-en). Completing the authentication tutorial provides the values for each of the required headers in all [!DNL Experience Platform] API calls, as shown below:

* Authorization: Bearer `{ACCESS_TOKEN}`
* x-api-key: `{API_KEY}`
* x-gw-ims-org-id: `{ORG_ID}`

Resources in [!DNL Experience Platform] can be isolated to specific virtual sandboxes. In requests to [!DNL Platform] APIs, you can specify the name and ID of the sandbox that the operation will take place in. These are optional parameters.

* x-sandbox-name: `{SANDBOX_NAME}`

>[!NOTE]
>
>For more information on sandboxes in [!DNL Experience Platform], see the [sandbox overview documentation](../../sandboxes/home.md).

All requests that contain a payload (POST, PUT, PATCH) require an additional media type header:

* Content-Type: `application/json`

### API reference documentation {#api-reference-documentation}

You can find accompanying reference documentation for all the API operations in this tutorial. Refer to the [Flow Service API documentation on Adobe I/O](https://www.adobe.io/experience-platform-apis/references/flow-service/). We recommend that you use this tutorial and the API reference documentation in parallel.

## Get the list of available destinations {#get-the-list-of-available-destinations}

![Destination steps overview step 1](../assets/api/batch-destination/step1.png)

As a first step, you should decide which destination to activate data to. To begin with, perform a call to request a list of available destinations that you can connect and activate audiences to. Perform the following GET request to the `connectionSpecs` endpoint to return a list of available destinations:

**API format**

```http
GET /connectionSpecs
```

**Request** 

```shell
curl --location --request GET 'https://platform.adobe.io/data/foundation/flowservice/connectionSpecs' \
--header 'accept: application/json' \
--header 'x-gw-ims-org-id: {ORG_ID}' \
--header 'x-api-key: {API_KEY}' \
--header 'x-sandbox-name: {SANDBOX_NAME}' \
--header 'Authorization: Bearer {ACCESS_TOKEN}'
```


**Response**

A successful response contains a list of available destinations and their unique identifiers (`id`). Store the value of the destination that you plan to use, as it will be required in further steps. For example, if you want to connect and deliver audiences to [!DNL Adobe Campaign], look for the following snippet in the response:

```json
{
    "id": "0b23e41a-cb4a-4321-a78f-3b654f5d7d97",
  "name": "Adobe Campaign",
  ...
  ...
}
```

For your reference, the table below contains the connection spec IDs for commonly used batch destinations:

| Destination | Connection spec ID |
---------|----------|
| [!DNL Adobe Campaign] | `0b23e41a-cb4a-4321-a78f-3b654f5d7d97` |
| [!DNL Oracle Eloqua] | `c1e44b6b-e7c8-404b-9031-58f0ef760604` |
| [!DNL Oracle Responsys] | `a5e28ddf-e265-426e-83a1-9d03a3a6822b` |
| [!DNL Salesforce Marketing Cloud] | `f599a5b3-60a7-4951-950a-cc4115c7ea27` |

{style="table-layout:auto"}

## Connect to your [!DNL Experience Platform] data {#connect-to-your-experience-platform-data}

![Destination steps overview step 2](../assets/api/batch-destination/step2.png)

Next, you must connect to your [!DNL Experience Platform] data, so you can export profile data and activate it in your preferred destination. This consists of two substeps which are described below.

1. First, you must perform a call to authorize access to your data in [!DNL Experience Platform], by setting up a base connection.
2. Then, using the base connection ID, perform another call in which you create a *source connection*, which establishes the connection to your [!DNL Experience Platform] data.

### Authorize access to your data in [!DNL Experience Platform]

**API format**

```http

}
```

## Connect to batch destination {#connect-to-batch-destination}

![Destination steps overview step 3](../assets/api/batch-destination/step3.png)

In this step, you are setting up a connection to your desired batch cloud storage or email marketing destination. This consists of two substeps which are described below.

1. First, you must perform a call to authorize access to the destination platform, by setting up a base connection.
2. Then, using the base connection ID, you will make another call in which you create a *target connection*, which specifies the location in your storage account where the exported data files will be delivered, as well as the format of the data that will be exported.

### Authorize access to the batch destination {#authorize-access-to-batch-destination}

**API format**

```http
POST /connections

### Specify storage location and data format {#specify-storage-location-data-format}

[!DNL Adobe Experience Platform] exports data for batch email marketing and cloud storage destinations in the form of [!DNL CSV] files. In this step, you can determine the path in your storage location where the files will be exported.

>[!IMPORTANT]
> 
>[!DNL Adobe Experience Platform] automatically splits the export files at 5 million records (rows) per file. Each row represents one profile.
>
>Split file names are appended with a number that indicates the file is part of a larger export, as such: `filename.csv`, `filename_2.csv`, `filename_3.csv`.

**API format**

```http
POST /targetConnections
```

**Request**

## Create a dataflow {#create-dataflow}

![Destination steps overview step 4](../assets/api/batch-destination/step4.png)

Using the flow spec, source connection, and target connection IDs that you obtained in the previous steps, you can now create a dataflow between your [!DNL Experience Platform] data and the destination where you will export data files. Think of this step as constructing the pipeline through which data will later flow between [!DNL Experience Platform] and your desired destination.

To create a dataflow, perform a POST request as shown below, while providing the values mentioned below within the payload.

**API format**

```http
POST /flows
```

**Request**

```shell
curl -X POST \
'https://platform.adobe.io/data/foundation/flowservice/flows' \

                    }
                }
            }
        ]
    }
```

| Property | Description |
| --------- | ----------- |
|`name`| Provide a name for the dataflow you are creating. |
|`description` | Optionally, you can provide a description for the dataflow. |
| `flowSpec.Id`| Use the flow spec ID for the batch destination that you want to connect to. To retrieve the flow spec ID, perform a GET operation on the `flowspecs` endpoint, as shown in the [flow specs API reference documentation](https://www.adobe.io/experience-platform-apis/references/flow-service/#operation/retrieveFlowSpec). In the response, look for `upsTo` and copy the corresponding ID of the batch destination that you want to connect to. For example, for Adobe Campaign, look for `upsToCampaign` and copy the `id` parameter.|
| `sourceConnectionIds`| Use the source connection ID you obtained in the step [Connect to your Experience Platform data](#connect-to-your-experience-platform-data).|
| `targetConnectionIds`| Use the target connection ID you obtained in the step [Connect to batch destination](#connect-to-batch-destination).|
| `transformations`| In the next step, you will populate this section with the audiences and profile attributes to be activated. |

For your reference, the table below contains the flow spec IDs for commonly used batch destinations:

| Destination | Flow spec ID |
---------|----------|
| All cloud storage destinations ([!DNL Amazon S3], SFTP, [!DNL Azure Blob]) and [!DNL Oracle Eloqua] | `71471eba-b620-49e4-90fd-23f1fa0174d8` |
| [!DNL Oracle Responsys] | `51d675ce-e270-408d-91fc-22717bdf2148` |
| [!DNL Salesforce Marketing Cloud] | `493b2bd6-26e4-4167-ab3b-5e910bba44f0` |

**Response**

A successful response returns the ID (`id`) of the newly created dataflow and an `etag`. Note down both values as you will need them in the next step, to activate audiences and export data files.

```json
{
    "id": "8256cfb4-17e6-432c-a469-6aedafb16cd5",
    "etag": "8256cfb4-17e6-432c-a469-6aedafb16cd5"
}
```


## Activate data to your new destination {#activate-data}

![Destination steps overview step 5](../assets/api/batch-destination/step5.png)

Having created all the connections and the dataflow, you now can activate your profile data to the destination platform. In this step, you select which audiences and which profile attributes to export to the destination.

You can also determine the file naming format of the exported files and which attributes should be used as [deduplication keys](../ui/activate-batch-profile-destinations.md#mandatory-keys) or [mandatory attributes](../ui/activate-batch-profile-destinations.md#mandatory-attributes). In this step, you can also determine the schedule to send data to the destination.

To activate audiences to your new destination, you must perform a JSON PATCH operation, similar to the example below. You can activate mutiple audiences and profile attributes in one call. To learn more about JSON PATCH, see the [RFC specification](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6902).

This ensures that when the activation job runs, the most up-to-date profiles are exported to your destination.</li><li>Select `"SCHEDULED"` to have the activation job run at a fixed time. This ensures that Experience Platform profile data is exported at the same time each day, but the profiles you export may not be the most up-to-date, depending on whether the batch segmentation job has completed before the activation job starts. When selecting this option, you must also add a `startTime` to indicate at which time in UTC the daily exports should occur.</li></ul> |
| `endDate` | For *batch destinations* only. This field is required only when adding an audience to a dataflow in batch file export destinations like Amazon S3, SFTP, or Azure Blob. <br> Not applicable when selecting `"exportMode":"DAILY_FULL_EXPORT"` and `"frequency":"ONCE"`. <br> Sets the date when audience members stop being exported to the destination. |
| `startTime` | For *batch destinations* only. This field is required only when adding an audience to a dataflow in batch file export destinations like Amazon S3, SFTP, or Azure Blob. <br> Mandatory. Select the time when files containing members of the audience should be generated and exported to your destination. |

**Response**

Look for a 202 Accepted response. No response body is returned. To validate that the request was correct, see the next step, [Validate the dataflow](#validate-dataflow).

## Validate the dataflow {#validate-dataflow}

![Destination steps overview step 6](../assets/api/batch-destination/step6.png)

As a final step in the tutorial, you should validate that the audiences and profile attributes have indeed been correctly mapped to the dataflow.

To validate this, perform the following GET request:

**API format**

```http
GET /flows
```

**Request**

```shell
curl --location --request PATCH 'https://platform.adobe.io/data/foundation/flowservice/flows/{DATAFLOW_ID}' \
--header 'Authorization: Bearer {ACCESS_TOKEN}' \
--header 'x-api-key: {API_KEY}' \
--header 'x-gw-ims-org-id: {ORG_ID}' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--header 'x-sandbox-name: prod' \
--header 'If-Match: "{ETAG}"' 
```

*   `{DATAFLOW_ID}`: Use the dataflow from the previous step.
*   `{ETAG}`: Use the etag from the previous step.

**Response**

The returned response should include in the `transformations` parameter the audiences and profile attributes that you submitted in the previous step. A sample `transformations` parameter in the response could look like below:

```json
"transformations":[
   {
      "name":"GeneralTransform",

## API error handling {#api-error-handling}

The API endpoints in this tutorial follow the general Experience Platform API error message principles. Refer to [API status codes](/help/landing/troubleshooting.md#api-status-codes) and [request header errors](/help/landing/troubleshooting.md#request-header-errors) in the Platform troubleshooting guide for more information on interpreting error responses.

## Next steps {#next-steps}

By following this tutorial, you have successfully connected Platform to one of your preferred file-based email marketing destinations and set up a dataflow to the respective destination to export data files. Outgoing data can now be used in the destination for email campaigns, targeted advertising, and many other use cases. See the following pages for more details, such as how to edit existing dataflows using the Flow Service API:

* [Destinations overview](../home.md)
* [Destinations Catalog overview](../catalog/overview.md)
* [Update destination dataflows using the Flow Service API](../api/update-destination-dataflows.md)
