# Create a new destination connection

## Overview {#overview}

Before you can send audience data to a destination, you must set up a connection to your destination platform. This article shows you how to set up a new destination using the Adobe Experience Platform user interface.

## Create a new destination connection {#setup}

1. Go to **[!UICONTROL Connections]** > **[!UICONTROL Destinations]**, and select the **[!UICONTROL Catalog]** tab.

1. Depending on whether you have an existing connection to your destination, you can see either a **[!UICONTROL Set up]** or an **[!UICONTROL Activate segments]** button on the destination card. For more information about the difference between **[!UICONTROL Activate segments]** and **[!UICONTROL Set up]**, refer to the [Catalog](../ui/destinations-workspace.md#catalog) section of the destination workspace documentation.

   Select either **[!UICONTROL Set up]** or **[!UICONTROL Activate segments]**, depending on which button is available to you.

You can select from Adobe-defined marketing actions or you can create your own marketing action. For more information about marketing actions, see the [data usage policies overview](../../data-governance/policies/overview.md) page.
