# Monitor dataflows

[!UICONTROL Destinations] allow you to activate your data from Adobe Experience Platform to countless external partners. 

Dataflows are a representation of data jobs that move data across [!DNL Experience Platform]. These dataflows are configured across different services, helping move data from source connectors to target datasets, where it is then utilized by [!DNL Identity Service] and[!DNL Real-Time Customer Profile] before ultimately being activated to destinations.

To learn more about monitoring dataflows for destinations, please read the [Monitor dataflows for destinations in the UI](../../dataflows/ui/monitor-destinations.md) tutorial.
