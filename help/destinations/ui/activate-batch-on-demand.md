>To activate data, you need the **[!UICONTROL Manage Destinations]**, **[!UICONTROL Activate Destinations]**, **[!UICONTROL View Profiles]**, and **[!UICONTROL View Segments]** [access control permissions](/help/access-control/home.md#permissions). Read the [access control overview](/help/access-control/ui/overview.md) or contact your product administrator to obtain the required permissions.

## Overview {#overview}

This article explains how to use the Experience Platform UI to activate audience segments to batch destinations such as cloud storage and email marketing destinations on-demand.

## Prerequisites {#prerequisites}

To activate data to destinations, you must have successfully [connected to a destination](./connect-destination.md). If you haven't done so already, go to the [destinations catalog](../catalog/overview.md), browse the supported destinations, and configure the destination that you want to use.

## Select your destination {#select-destination}

1. Go to **[!UICONTROL Connections > Destinations]**, and select the **[!UICONTROL Catalog]** tab.
