# Activate audience data to streaming profile export destinations

>[!IMPORTANT]
> 
> * To activate data and enable the [mapping step](#mapping) of the workflow, you need the **[!UICONTROL Manage Destinations]**, **[!UICONTROL Activate Destinations]**, **[!UICONTROL View Profiles]**, and **[!UICONTROL View Segments]** [access control permissions](/help/access-control/home.md#permissions).
> * To activate data without going through the [mapping step](#mapping) of the workflow, you need the **[!UICONTROL Manage Destinations]**, **[!UICONTROL Activate Segment without Mapping]**, **[!UICONTROL View Profiles]**, and **[!UICONTROL View Segments]** [access control permissions](/help/access-control/home.md#permissions).

> Read the [access control overview](/help/access-control/ui/overview.md) or contact your product administrator to obtain the required permissions.

## Overview {#overview}

This article explains the workflow required to activate audience data in Adobe Experience Platform streaming profile-based destinations, such as Amazon Kinesis.

## Prerequisites {#prerequisites}

To activate data to destinations, you must have successfully [connected to a destination](./connect-destination.md). If you haven't done so already, go to the [destinations catalog](../catalog/overview.md), browse the supported destinations, and configure the destination that you want to use.

## Select your destination {#select-destination}

1. Go to **[!UICONTROL Connections > Destinations]**, and select the **[!UICONTROL Catalog]** tab.
    
    ![Image showing the destination catalog tab.](../assets/ui/activate-streaming-profile-destinations/catalog-tab.png)

1. Select **[!UICONTROL Activate segments]** on the card corresponding to the destination where you want to activate your segments, as shown in the image below.

    ![Image highlighting the activate segments control in the destinations catalog tab.](../assets/ui/activate-streaming-profile-destinations/activate-segments-button.png)

1. Select the destination connection that you want to use to activate your segments, then select **[!UICONTROL Next]**.

1. Move to the next section to [select your segments](#select-segments).

## Select your segments {#select-segments}

Use the check boxes to the left of the segment names to select the segments that you want to activate to the destination, then select **[!UICONTROL Next]**.

## Select profile attributes {#select-attributes}

In the **[!UICONTROL Mapping]** step, select the profile attributes that you want to send to the target destination.

>[!NOTE]
>
> Adobe Experience Platform prefills your selection with four recommended, commonly used attributes from your schema: `person.name.firstName`, `person.name.lastName`, `personalEmail.address`, `segmentMembership.status`.

File exports will vary in the following ways, depending on whether `segmentMembership.status` is selected:
* If the `segmentMembership.status` field is selected, exported files include **[!UICONTROL Active]** members in the initial full snapshot and **[!UICONTROL Active]** and **[!UICONTROL Expired]** members in subsequent incremental exports.
* If the `segmentMembership.status` field is not selected, exported files include only **[!UICONTROL Active]** members in the initial full snapshot and in subsequent incremental exports.

![Image showing the prefilled, recommended attributes in the mapping step.](../assets/ui/activate-streaming-profile-destinations/attributes-default.png) 

1. In the **[!UICONTROL Select attributes]** page, select **[!UICONTROL Add new field]**.
    
    ![Image highlighting the Add new field control in the mapping step.](../assets/ui/activate-streaming-profile-destinations/add-new-field.png)

1. Select the arrow to the right of the **[!UICONTROL Schema field]** entry.

    ![Image highlighting the how to select a source field in the mapping step.](../assets/ui/activate-streaming-profile-destinations/select-schema-field.png)

1. In the **[!UICONTROL Select field]** page, select the XDM attributes that you want to send to the destination, then choose **[!UICONTROL Select]**.

    ![Image showing a selection of XDM fields that you can select as source fields.](../assets/ui/activate-streaming-profile-destinations/target-field-page.png)


1. To add more mappings, repeat steps 1 to 3, then select **[!UICONTROL Next]**.

## Review {#review}

On the **[!UICONTROL Review]** page, you can see a summary of your selection. Select **[!UICONTROL Cancel]** to break up the flow, **[!UICONTROL Back]** to modify your settings, or **[!UICONTROL Finish]** to confirm your selection and start sending data to the destination.

### Consent policy evaluation {#consent-policy-evaluation}

If your organization purchased **Adobe Healthcare Shield** or **Adobe Privacy & Security Shield**, select **[!UICONTROL View applicable consent policies]** to see which consent policies are applied and how many profiles are included in the activation as a result of them. Read about [consent policy evaluation](/help/data-governance/enforcement/auto-enforcement.md#consent-policy-evaluation) for more information.

### Data usage policy checks {#data-usage-policy-checks}

In the **[!UICONTROL Review]** step, Experience Platform also checks for any data usage policy violations. Shown below is an example where a policy is violated. You cannot complete the segment activation workflow until you have resolved the violation. For information on how to resolve policy violations, read about [data usage policy violations](/help/data-governance/enforcement/auto-enforcement.md#data-usage-violation) in the data governance documentation section.

### Filter segments {#filter-segments}

Also in this step you can use the available filters on the page to display only the segments whose schedule or mapping has been updated as part of this workflow. 

![Screen recording showing the available segment filters in the review step.](/help/destinations/assets/ui/activate-streaming-profile-destinations/filter-segments-review-step.gif)

If you are satisfied with your selection and no policy violations have been detected, select **[!UICONTROL Finish]** to confirm your selection and start sending data to the destination. 

## Verify segment activation {#verify}

Your exported [!DNL Experience Platform] data lands in your target destination in JSON format. For example, the event below contains the email address profile attribute of an audience that has qualified for a certain segment and exited another segment. The identities for this prospect are ECID and email.

```json
{
  "person": {
    "email": "yourstruly@adobe.com"
  },
  "segmentMembership": {
    "ups": {
      "7841ba61-23c1-4bb3-a495-00d3g5fe1e93": {

  },

      {
        "id": "66478888669296734530114754794777368480"
      }
    ],
    "email_lc_sha256": [

    ]
  }
}

```
