# Activate audience data to streaming profile export destinations

## Overview {#overview}

This article explains the workflow required to activate audience data in Adobe Experience Platform streaming profile-based destinations, such as Amazon Kinesis.

## Prerequisites {#prerequisites}

To activate data to destinations, you must have successfully [connected to a destination](./connect-destination.md). If you haven't done so already, go to the [destinations catalog](../catalog/overview.md), browse the supported destinations, and configure the destination that you want to use.

## Select your destination {#select-destination}

1. Go to **[!UICONTROL Connections > Destinations]**, and select the **[!UICONTROL Browse]** tab.

1. Select the **[!UICONTROL Add segments]** button corresponding to the destination where you want to activate your segments, as shown in the image below.

1. Move to the next section to [select your segments](#select-segments).

## Select your segments {#select-segments}

Use the check boxes to the left of the segment names to select the segments that you want to activate to the destination, then select **[!UICONTROL Next]**.

## Select profile attributes {#select-attributes}

Select the profile attributes that you want to send to the target destination.

>[!NOTE] 
>
> Adobe Experience Platform prefills your selection with four recommended, commonly used attributes from your schema: `person.name.firstName`, `person.name.lastName`, `personalEmail.address`, `segmentMembership.status`.

File exports will vary in the following ways, depending on whether `segmentMembership.status` is selected:
* If the `segmentMembership.status` field is selected, exported files include **[!UICONTROL Active]** members in the initial full snapshot and **[!UICONTROL Active]** and **[!UICONTROL Expired]** members in subsequent incremental exports.
* If the `segmentMembership.status` field is not selected, exported files include only **[!UICONTROL Active]** members in the initial full snapshot and in subsequent incremental exports.

1. To add more mappings, repeat steps 1 to 3, then select **[!UICONTROL Next]**.

## Review {#review}

On the **[!UICONTROL Review]** page, you can see a summary of your selection. Select **[!UICONTROL Cancel]** to break up the flow, **[!UICONTROL Back]** to modify your settings, or **[!UICONTROL Finish]** to confirm your selection and start sending data to the destination.

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>In this step, Adobe Experience Platform checks for data usage policy violations. Shown below is an example where a policy is violated. You cannot complete the segment activation workflow until you have resolved the violation. For information on how to resolve policy violations, see [Policy enforcement](../../rtcdp/privacy/data-governance-overview.md#enforcement) in the data governance documentation section.

If no policy violations have been detected, select **[!UICONTROL Finish]** to confirm your selection and start sending data to the destination.

## Verify segment activation {#verify}

Your exported [!DNL Experience Platform] data lands in your target destination in JSON format. For example, the event below contains the email address profile attribute of an audience that has qualified for a certain segment and exited another segment. The identities for this prospect are ECID and email.

```json
{
  "person": {
    "email": "yourstruly@adobe.con"
  },
  "segmentMembership": {
    "ups": {
      "7841ba61-23c1-4bb3-a495-00d3g5fe1e93": {
        "lastQualificationTime": "2020-05-25T21:24:39Z",

        "status": "existing"
      }
    }
  },
  "identityMap": {
    "ecid": [

        "id": "14575006536349286404619648085736425115"
      },
      {
        "id": "66478888669296734530114754794777368480"
      }
    ],
    "email_lc_sha256": [
