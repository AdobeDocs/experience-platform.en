# Edit destinations

Learn how to edit various components of an existing destination connection, including how to update authentication credentials, export location, and more by using the Experience Platform UI.

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>This functionality is in beta and only available to select customers. To request access, contact your Adobe representative.

>[!NOTE]
>
> The edit operations described in this tutorial are also supported via API operations. Read the tutorial on how to [edit destinations in the API](/help/destinations/api/edit-destination.md) for more information.

To edit various components of an existing destination connection: 

1. Navigate to **[!UICONTROL Destinations]** > **[!UICONTROL Browse]**.
2. Select the desired destination that you want to edit.
3. Select the ellipsis (`...`) in the [!UICONTROL Name] column and use the ![Edit destination control](/help/images/icons/edit.png)**[!UICONTROL Edit destination]** control to edit existing destination connections.
4. In the modal window, edit any desired settings. Select **[!UICONTROL Save]** when done.

In the edit destination window, you can update any settings that you configured when you initially connected to the destination. These settings are different based on the destination platform that you are updating.

Depending on how the destination was configured, some fields might be read-only and cannot be edited. To change the value of read-only fields, you must [create a new destination connection](../ui/connect-destination.md) with the new field values.

Below are some examples of the settings that you can update for [Amazon S3](../catalog/cloud-storage/amazon-s3.md), [Azure Event Hubs](../catalog/cloud-storage/azure-event-hubs.md), and [Google Ads](../catalog/advertising/google-ads-destination.md) destinations.

<div style="display: flex; gap: 12px; justify-content: flex-start; align-items: flex-start;">
  <img class="modal-image" src="../assets/ui/edit-destinations/edit-amazon-s3-connection.png" alt="Edit destination screen for the Amazon S3 destination." style="max-width: 200px; height: auto; border: 1px solid #ccc;">

  <img class="modal-image" src="../assets/ui/edit-destinations/edit-google-ads-connection.png" alt="Edit destination screen for the Google Ads destination." style="max-width: 200px; height: auto; border: 1px solid #ccc;">
</div>

>[!SUCCESS]
