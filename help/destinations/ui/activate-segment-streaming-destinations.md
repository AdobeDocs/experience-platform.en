## Overview {#overview}

This article explains the workflow required to activate audiences in Adobe Experience Platform streaming destinations.

## Prerequisites {#prerequisites}

To activate audiences to destinations, you must have successfully [connected to a destination](./connect-destination.md). If you haven't done so already, go to the [destinations catalog](../catalog/overview.md), browse the supported destinations, and configure the destination that you want to use.

## Select your destination {#select-destination}

1. Go to **[!UICONTROL Connections > Destinations]**, and select the **[!UICONTROL Catalog]** tab.
    
    ![Destination Catalog tab showing various streaming destinations.](../assets/ui/activate-segment-streaming-destinations/catalog-tab.png)

1. Select **[!UICONTROL Activate audiences]** on the card corresponding to the destination where you want to activate your audiences, as shown in the image below.

    ![Activate control highlighted in the destinations catalog.](../assets/ui/activate-segment-streaming-destinations/activate-audiences-button.png)

1. Select the destination connection that you want to use to activate your audiences, then select **[!UICONTROL Next]**.

    ![A destination connection highlighted in the Select destination step.](../assets/ui/activate-segment-streaming-destinations/select-destination.png)

1. Move to the next section to [select your audiences](#select-audiences).

## Select your audiences {#select-audiences}

To select the audiences that you want to activate to the destination, use the check boxes to the left of the audience names, then select **[!UICONTROL Next]**.

You can select from multiple types of audiences, depending on their origin:

* **[!UICONTROL Segmentation Service]**: Audiences generated within Experience Platform by the Segmentation Service. See the [segmentation documentation](../../segmentation/ui/overview.md) for more details.
* **[!UICONTROL Custom upload]**: Audiences generated outside of Experience Platform, and uploaded into Platform as CSV files. To learn more about external audiences, see the documentation on [importing an audience](../../segmentation/ui/overview.md#import-audience).
* Other types of audiences, originating from other Adobe solutions, such as [!DNL Audience Manager].

## Map attributes and identities {#mapping}

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>This step only applies to some audience streaming destinations. If your destination does not have a **[!UICONTROL Mapping]** step, skip to [audience scheduling](#scheduling).

Some audience streaming destinations require you to select source attributes or identity namespaces to map as target identities in the destination.

1. In the **[!UICONTROL Mapping]** page, select **[!UICONTROL Add new mapping]**.
    
    ![Add new mapping control highlighted.](../assets/ui/activate-segment-streaming-destinations/add-new-mapping.png)

1. Select the arrow to the right of the **[!UICONTROL Source field]** entry.

    ![Select source field control highlighted.](../assets/ui/activate-segment-streaming-destinations/select-source-field.png)

1. In the **[!UICONTROL Select source field]** page, use the **[!UICONTROL Select attributes]** or the **[!UICONTROL Select identity namespace]** options to switch between the two categories of available source fields. From the available [!DNL XDM] profile attributes and identity namespaces, select the ones that you want to map to the destination, then choose **[!UICONTROL Select]**.

    ![Select source field page showing several available source fields.](../assets/ui/activate-segment-streaming-destinations/source-field-page.png)

1. Select the button to the right of the **[!UICONTROL Target field]** entry.

    ![Select target field highlighted.](../assets/ui/activate-segment-streaming-destinations/select-target-field.png)

1. In the **[!UICONTROL Select target field]** page, select the target identity namespace that you want to map the source field to, and choose **[!UICONTROL Select]**.

    ![Select target field page showing available options for target field mappings.](../assets/ui/activate-segment-streaming-destinations/target-field-page.png)

1. To add more mappings, repeat steps 1 to 5.

### Apply transformation {#apply-transformation}

>[!CONTEXTUALHELP]
>id="platform_destinations_activate_applytransformation"
>title="Apply transformation"
>abstract="Check this option when using unhashed source fields, to have Adobe Experience Platform automatically hash them on activation."

When you are mapping unhashed source attributes to target attributes that the destination expects to be hashed (for example: `email_lc_sha256` or `phone_sha256`), check the **Apply transformation** option to have Adobe Experience Platform automatically hash the source attributes on activation.

![Apply transformation control highlighted in the Identity mapping step.](../assets/ui/activate-segment-streaming-destinations/mapping-summary.png)

## Schedule audience export {#scheduling}

>[!CONTEXTUALHELP]
>id="platform_destinations_activate_enddate"
>title="End date"
>abstract="Adding an end date for audience schedule is not available."

By default, the **[!UICONTROL Audience schedule]** page shows only the newly selected audiences that you chose in the current activation flow.

To see all the audiences being activated to your destination, use the filtering option and disable the **[!UICONTROL Show new audiences only]** filter.

![All audiences](../assets/ui/activate-segment-streaming-destinations/all-audiences.png)

1. On the **[!UICONTROL Audience schedule]** page, select each audience, then use the **[!UICONTROL Start date]** and **[!UICONTROL End date]** selectors to configure the time interval for sending data to your destination.

    ![Audience schedule filter highlighted.](../assets/ui/activate-segment-streaming-destinations/audience-schedule.png)

    * Some destinations require you to select the **[!UICONTROL Origin of audience]** for each audience, using the drop-down menu underneath the calendar selectors. If your destination does not include this selector, skip this step.

        ![Mapping ID dropdown highlighted.](../assets/ui/activate-segment-streaming-destinations/origin-of-audience.png)

    * Some destinations require you to manually map [!DNL Platform] audiences to their counterpart in the target destination. To do this, select each audience, then enter the corresponding audience ID from the destination platform in the **[!UICONTROL Mapping ID]** field. If your destination does not include this field, skip this step.

        ![Origin of audience dropdown highlighted.](../assets/ui/activate-segment-streaming-destinations/mapping-id.png)

    * Some destinations require you to enter an **[!UICONTROL App ID]** when activating [!DNL IDFA] or [!DNL GAID] audiences. If your destination does not include this field, skip this step.

        ![App ID dropdown highlighted.](../assets/ui/activate-segment-streaming-destinations/destination-appid.png)

1. Select **[!UICONTROL Next]** to go to the [!UICONTROL Review] page.

## Review {#review}

On the **[!UICONTROL Review]** page, you can see a summary of your selection. Select **[!UICONTROL Cancel]** to break up the flow, **[!UICONTROL Back]** to modify your settings, or **[!UICONTROL Finish]** to confirm your selection and start sending data to the destination.

![Selection summary in the review step.](../assets/ui/activate-segment-streaming-destinations/review.png)

### Consent policy evaluation {#consent-policy-evaluation}

If your organization purchased **Adobe Healthcare Shield** or **Adobe Privacy & Security Shield**, select **[!UICONTROL View applicable consent policies]** to see which consent policies are applied and how many profiles are included in the activation as a result of them. Read about [consent policy evaluation](/help/data-governance/enforcement/auto-enforcement.md#consent-policy-evaluation) for more information.

### Data usage policy checks {#data-usage-policy-checks}

In the **[!UICONTROL Review]** step, Experience Platform also checks for any data usage policy violations. Shown below is an example where a policy is violated. You cannot complete the audience activation workflow until you have resolved the violation. For information on how to resolve policy violations, read about [data usage policy violations](/help/data-governance/enforcement/auto-enforcement.md#data-usage-violation) in the data governance documentation section.
 
![An example of a data policy violation shown in the activation workflow.](../assets/common/data-policy-violation.png)

### Filter audiences {#filter-audiences}

Also in this step you can use the available filters on the page to display only the audiences whose schedule or mapping has been updated as part of this workflow. You can also toggle which table columns you want to see. 

![Screen recording showing the available audience filters in the review step.](../assets/ui/activate-segment-streaming-destinations/filter-audiences-review-step.gif)

If you are satisfied with your selection and no policy violations have been detected, select **[!UICONTROL Finish]** to confirm your selection and start sending data to the destination. 

## Verify audience activation {#verify}

Check the [destination monitoring documentation](../../dataflows/ui/monitor-destinations.md) for detailed information on how to monitor the flow of data to your destinations.

<!-- 
For [!DNL Facebook Custom Audience], a successful activation means that a [!DNL Facebook] custom audience would be created programmatically in [[!UICONTROL Facebook Ads Manager]](https://www.facebook.com/adsmanager/manage/). Audience membership in the audience would be added and removed as users are qualified or disqualified for the activated audiences.

>[!TIP]
>
>The integration between Adobe Experience Platform and [!DNL Facebook] supports historical audience backfills. All historical audience qualifications are sent to [!DNL Facebook] when you activate the audiences to the destination.
