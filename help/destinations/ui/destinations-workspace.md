## [!UICONTROL Catalog] {#catalog}

The **[!UICONTROL Catalog]** tab displays a list of all destinations available in [!DNL Platform], that you can send data to. 

The [!DNL Platform] user interface provides several search and filter options on the destinations catalog page:

* Use the search functionality on the page to locate a specific destination.
* Filter destinations using the [!UICONTROL Categories] control.
* Toggle between [!UICONTROL All destinations] and [!UICONTROL My destinations]. When you select **[!UICONTROL All destinations]**, all available [!DNL Platform] destinations are displayed.

* Select to view the **[!UICONTROL Connections]** and/or **[!UICONTROL Extensions]** types. To understand the difference between the two categories, read [Destination Types and Categories](../destination-types.md).
