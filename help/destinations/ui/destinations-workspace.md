# Destinations workspace {#destinations-workspace}

In Adobe Experience Platform, select **[!UICONTROL Destinations]** from the left navigation bar to access the [!UICONTROL Destinations] workspace.

The [!UICONTROL Destinations] workspace consists of five sections, [!UICONTROL Overview], [!UICONTROL Catalog], [!UICONTROL Browse], [!UICONTROL Accounts], and [!UICONTROL System View], described in the sections below.

![Destinations-overview](../assets/ui/workspace/destinations-overview.png)

## [!UICONTROL Overview] {#overview}

The **[!UICONTROL Overview]** tab displays the [!UICONTROL Destinations] dashboard, providing key metrics related your organization's destination data. To learn more, visit the [[!UICONTROL Destinations] dashboard guide](../../dashboards/guides/destinations.md).

>[!NOTE]
>
>If your organization is new to Experience Platform and does not yet have active destinations, the [!UICONTROL Destinations] dashboard and [!UICONTROL Overview] tab are not visible. Instead, selecting [!UICONTROL Destinations] from the left navigation displays the [[!UICONTROL Catalog] tab](#catalog).

## [!UICONTROL Catalog] {#catalog}

The **[!UICONTROL Catalog]** tab displays a list of all destinations available in [!DNL Platform], that you can send data to. 

The [!DNL Platform] user interface provides several search and filter options on the destinations catalog page:

* Use the search functionality on the page to locate a specific destination.
* Filter destinations using the [!UICONTROL Categories] control.
* Toggle between [!UICONTROL All destinations] and [!UICONTROL My destinations]. When you select **[!UICONTROL All destinations]**, all available [!DNL Platform] destinations are displayed. When you select **[!UICONTROL My destinations]**, you can only see the destinations with which you have established a connection.
* Select to view **[!UICONTROL Connections]** and/or **[!UICONTROL Extensions]**. To understand the difference between the two categories, see [Destination Types and Categories](../destination-types.md).

![Catalog](../assets/ui/workspace/catalog.png)

The destination cards contain either a **[!UICONTROL Set up]** or an **[!UICONTROL Activate segments]** control, and a secondary control that brings up more options. These controls are described below:

| Control | Description |
