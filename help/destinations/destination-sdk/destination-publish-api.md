>**API endpoint**: `platform.adobe.io/data/core/activation/authoring/destinations/publish` 

This page lists and describes all the API operations that you can perform using the `/authoring/destinations/publish` API endpoint. 

After you have configured and tested your destination, you can submit it to Adobe for review and publishing.

Use the publish destinations API endpoint to submit a publishing request when:
* As a Destination SDK partner, you want to make your productized destination available across all Experience Platform organizations for all Experience Platform customers to use;
* You want to make your custom destination available in your own Experience Platform organization, across all sandboxes.

## API error handling

Destination SDK API endpoints follow the general Experience Platform API error message principles. Refer to [API status codes](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-platform/landing/troubleshooting.html?lang=en#api-status-codes) and [request header errors](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-platform/landing/troubleshooting.html?lang=en#request-header-errors) in the Platform troubleshooting guide.

## Next steps

After reading this document, you now know how to submit a publish request for your destination. The Adobe Experience Platform team will review your publish request and get back to you with five business days.
