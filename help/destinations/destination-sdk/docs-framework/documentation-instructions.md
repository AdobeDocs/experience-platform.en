# Document your destination in Adobe Experience Platform

## Overview {#overview}

Welcome to Adobe Experience Platform, great to have you here!
Documenting your destination is the final step before it can be set live in Adobe Experience Platform.

This documentation section includes:

* Step-by step instructions for you to create a documentation page for your new destination;
* A template for you to fill out for your destination;
* [General instructions on using Markdown](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/contributor/contributor-guide/writing-essentials/markdown.html?lang=en);
* [Specific instructions for the Adobe Markdown flavor](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/contributor/contributor-guide/writing-essentials/markdown.html?lang=en#custom-markdown-extensions) (the Adobe Markdown flavor is very similar to regular Markdown).

## Prerequisites {#prerequisites}

To create documentation for your destination according to the instructions in this article, the following items are necessary:

* **A GitHub account**. Sign up for [GitHub](https://github.com/) if you don't have an account yet.
* **GitHub Desktop**. If you select to [create the documentation in your local environment](./work-in-local-environment.md), you must use [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/).
* Your integration with Adobe must be in a testing phase with your destination deployed in a staging environment in Adobe Experience Platform.

## High-level instructions to create documentation for your destination in Adobe Experience Platform {#high-level-instructions}

At a high level, to create documentation for your destination, you need to [create a fork](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/contributor/contributor-guide/setup/local-repo.html?lang=en#fork-the-repository) of the Adobe Experience Platform documentation repository and edit the [provided documentation template](./self-service-template.md) in a new branch. Use the Adobe-provided template to create a new destination page. Open a pull request (PR) when you are ready. Instructions to do this are further below, in [Steps to create your new destination page](./documentation-instructions.md#steps-to-create-docs-page).

>[!TIP]
>
>See [Writing guidance for Adobe Documentation](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/contributor/contributor-guide/writing-essentials/general-writing-guidance.html?lang=en) for some quick writing tips that the Adobe documentation team uses when authoring documentation.

<!--

* In the table of contents (TOC.md) `/help/rtcdp/TOC.md`, add a link to your new destination page. Place it within the category where your destination resides in the Adobe Experience Platform user interface (for example: mobile, social, advertising). 
* In the overview page for the respective category, add a link to your new destination page. For example, for cloud storage destinations, you would add a link to [this page](https://docs.adobe.com/content/help/en/experience-platform/rtcdp/destinations/destinations-cat/cloud-storage/cloud-storage-destinations.html). 

-->

## Documentation template {#documentation-template}

To assist you in creating your documentation page, Adobe has prefilled a [documentation template](./self-service-template.md) for you. Further below, you can find instructions how to edit the template and open a pull request. The Adobe documentation team will review and publish the documentation for your new destination.

[Download the template here](assets/yourdestination-template.zip) and unzip the file to extract the `yourdestination.md` file.

Instructions on using the template to create your documentation page are further below.

<!--

### Text editors and IDEs

If looking for a text editor, we recommend:

- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- [PHPStorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/phpstorm/)
- [Atom](https://atom.io/)
- [Sublime](https://www.sublimetext.com/)

Add markdown extensions and plugins to help with formatting and previews as you type. For Visual Studio Code, we recommend the following extensions for real-time previews and more:

- Markdown
- Markdown All in One
- Markdownlinter 
- GitLens
- GitHub Pull Requests
- Git Project Manager

[Markdown and Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/markdown) documents markdown extensions, edits, and previews.

## Writing guidelines

- Write content using Markdown, a simple way to format content.
- Focus your efforts on providing useful information for the customers. For example, consider providing or revising code samples, important notes, and clarifying vague or ambiguous content.
- Define the goal of your topic. What exactly do you want to teach the reader?
- For new topics, add a title that reflects the content.
- Keep your sentences concise. Separate conceptual information from procedural steps.
- Remember to write in present tense, use the second person, and use active voice (not passive). For example, _"The log captures commands, output..."_.
- Combine multiple small changes (such as minor editorial and technical changes) into a single pull request. This helps us efficiently and effectively facilitate your contribution.

## Writing styles and markdown

The following sections provide simple formats for content. For additional formats, see markdown guides like [Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/). 

For an example of documentation using multiple Markdown formats, see the following: Managing Sources in [HTML](https://docs.magento.com/user-guide/catalog/inventory-sources.html) and [source code](https://github.com/magento/Adobe Real-time CDP/master/src/catalog/inventory-sources.md).

[[/images/markdown-example.png]]

### Create a new page

There are two basic things to do when you want to add a new page. The first is to create the markdown file that contains the content for your page. The second is to add the page to the site navigation so that users will find it alongside related information.

Our content files are organized within a series of folders (directories) that group them by subject area. Before you create a new content file, you should figure out where in belongs in the file structure. The easiest way to do that is to review the User Guide site and decide where it best fits within the existing content organization. When you find that spot, you can look at a neighboring page to determine where that source file is located and create your new markdown file in the same directory.

Each major section of the guide is defined by a .yml file located in the src/_data directory. These files are used to define the structure and navigation, where each one maps to a section of the guide as you see it displayed in the left navigation. If you would rather not work with these files to add your page to the structure, just request assistance in your PR and one of our Doc Team members will help you out and add the correct navigation link for your page.

### Metadata

Every file begins with front matter or metadata for your content. This information includes:

```
---
keywords: Improve search results by adding keywords for your page
title: The title of the page
description: YOURDESTINATION does this and that and you should start using it as soon as possible. 
---
```


The title displays as the title of the page.

![title](/templates/assets/markdown-title.png)

### Paragraphs 

As you start writing content, it automatically generates along the left side (or margin). To create a paragraph, leave an empty line between sentences.

If you need to indent content, use the tab key. Each tab moves content to the right, indenting the page content. 

### Text effects
To format for bolding and italics, see the following:

| Example           | Output       |
| ----------------- | ------------ |
|`*emphasis*`       | *emphasis*   |
|`**bold**`         | **bold**     |

### Bulleted lists
We recommend using a dash (`-`) for each line in a bulleted list. Lists also support `*`.

```markdown
- List Item 1
- List Item 2
- List Item 3
```

### Numbered steps

Numbered lists add numbers to a set of instructions or steps. Start every line with `1.`. When building the documentation, the instructions automatically number for you.

For procedures that require supporting information for steps, such as screens or descriptions of the available option, make sure that you nest the supplemental information under the numbered item. As a general rule, the numbered item should be a single-sentence, simple directive. Then you can nest the information that is required for the reader to successfully complete that directive. Use three spaces to indent the supporting elements. 

For example:

```
1. In the _Scheduled Changes_ box at the top of the page, click **Preview**.

   The Preview opens a new browser tab and shows how the product will appear during the scheduled campaign.

   ![]({% link images/images-ee/content-staging-product-scheduled-update-preview.png %}){: .zoom}
   _Promotion - preview scheduled Cchange_

1. In the upper-left corner of the Preview window, click **Calendar**.

   The calendar detail shows other campaigns that are scheduled for the same day. Each record in the list is a separate campaign.

   ![]({% link images/images-ee/content-staging-product-preview-calendar.png %}){: .zoom}
   _List of Campaigns Scheduled for a Specific Date_
```

### Tables

Simple tables can help format content. For example, lists of attributes with descriptions. Adding the style below the table helps with formatting column widths.

```
| Attribute | Description |
|--|--|
|name|Description of name|
|id|Description of ID|
```

### Links

Adding links to content outside of documentation such as an external website: 

```
[text](web-address)
```

For example:

```
[GitHub](http://github.com)
```

Adding links to other pages or topics within the user guide: 

```
[Topic Name]({% link <folder>/<filename>.md -%})
```

For example:

```
[Managing Inventory]({% link catalog/inventory-management.md -%})
```

### Images

We recommend saving all images in PNG format. Images are typically saved in the src/images location in one of the following folders:

- `images` holds Open Source/all editions images
- `images-b2b` holds B2B images
- `images-ee` holds Commerce images

The code for displaying images is:

```
![Alt Text]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link images/<folder>/<filename> %}){: .zoom}
_Caption_
```

The `{: .zoom}` option is used for large images to display a scaled down image. Readers can click the image to open the full size. The caption displays under the image with emphasis.

For example: 

```
![Import Sections]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link images/images/dotdigital-dash-import.png %}){: .zoom}
_Import Settings_
```

### Notes

To highlight content in an information or "note" box, use a standard info note. It adds a blue box and an info icon. Change `info` to `tip` or `warning` for those formats.

```
{:.bs-callout-info}
Note content
```

### Template

For additional formats and options, you can reference this basic template: [**General topic template**](https://github.com/magento/Adobe Real-time CDP/blob/master/.github/TOPIC_TEMPLATE)
