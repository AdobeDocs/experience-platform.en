## Export type {#export-type}

**Segment Export** - you are exporting all members of a segment (audience) with the identifiers (name, phone number, or others) used in the *YOURDESTINATION* destination.

## Use Cases

To help you better understand how and when you should use the *YOURDESTINATION* destination, here are sample use cases that Adobe Experience Platform customers can solve by using this destination.


### Use Case #1

*For mobile messaging platforms:*

*A home rental and sales platform wants to push mobile notifications to customers' Android and iOS devices to let them know that there are 100 updated listings in the area where they previously searched for a rental.*

### Use Case #2

*For social network platforms:*

*An athletic apparel brand wants to reach existing customers through their social media accounts. The apparel brand can ingest email addresses from their own CRM to Adobe Experience Platform, build segments from their own offline data, and send these segments to YOURDESTINATION, to display ads in their customers' social media feeds.*

## Connect to the destination {#connect}

To connect to this destination, follow the steps described in the [destination configuration tutorial](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-platform/destinations/ui/connect-destination.html).

### Connection parameters {#parameters}

While [setting up](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-platform/destinations/ui/connect-destination.html) this destination, you must provide the following information:

*Add the fields that customers must fill in when configuring a new destination. These fields are destination-specific and depend on your configuration in Destination SDK. Your destination's fields may not be the same as the ones listed below.*

*  **[!UICONTROL Name]**: A name by which you will recognize this destination in the future.
*  **[!UICONTROL Description]**: A description that will help you identify this destination in the future.
*  **[!UICONTROL Account ID]**: Your *YOURDESTINATION* account ID.


<!--

*Replace YOURDESTINATION with your destination name and TOBEFILLEDIN with the category that your destination belongs to.*

1. In **[!UICONTROL Destinations]** > **[!UICONTROL Catalog]**, scroll to the ***TOBEFILLEDIN*** category. Select ***YOURDESTINATION***, then select **[!UICONTROL Configure]**.


    >[!NOTE]
    >
    >If a connection with this destination already exists, you can see an **[!UICONTROL Activate]** button on the destination card. For more information about the difference between **[!UICONTROL Activate]** and **[!UICONTROL Configure]**, refer to the [Catalog](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-platform/destinations/ui/destinations-workspace.html#catalog) section of the destination workspace documentation.  

    ![Connect to YOURDESTINATION](./assets/yourdestination1.png)

2. In the **Account** step, if you had previously set up a connection to your *YOURDESTINATION* destination, select **[!UICONTROL Existing Account]** and select your existing connection. Or, you can select **[!UICONTROL New Account]** to set up a new connection to *YOURDESTINATION*. Select **[!UICONTROL Connect to destination]** to log in and connect Adobe Experience Cloud to your *YOURDESTINATION* account.

    >[!NOTE]
    >
    >Adobe Experience Platform supports credentials validation in the authentication process and displays an error message if you input incorrect credentials to your ***YOURDESTINATION*** account. This ensures that you don't complete the workflow with incorrect credentials.

3. Once your credentials are confirmed and Adobe Experience Cloud is connected to your ***YOURDESTINATION*** account, you can select **[!UICONTROL Next]** to proceed to the **[!UICONTROL Setup]** step.

4. In the **[!UICONTROL Authentication]** step, enter a **[!UICONTROL Name]** and a **[!UICONTROL Description]** for your activation flow and fill your account ID. <br> Also in this step, you can select any marketing action that should apply to this destination. Marketing actions indicate the intent for which data will be exported to the destination. You can select from Adobe-defined marketing actions or you can create your own marketing action. For more information about marketing actions, see the [Data usage policies overview](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-platform/data-governance/policies/overview.html).

    ![Connect to YOURDESTINATION](./assets/yourdestination2.png)

5. Your destination is now created. You can select **[!UICONTROL Save & Exit]** if you want to activate segments later on or you can select **[!UICONTROL Next]** to continue the workflow and select segments to activate. In either case, see the next section, [Activate segments](#activate-segments), for the rest of the workflow.

![identity mapping initial screen](./assets/gcm-identity-mapping.png) <br>&nbsp;
   *Plain text email address as primary identity*: If you have plain text (unhashed) email addresses as primary identity in your schema, select the email field in your **[!UICONTROL Source Attributes]** and map to the Email field in the right column under **[!UICONTROL Target Identities]**, as shown below. Set up a mapping between any other attributes you plan to use.
   ![identity mapping step](./assets/ssd-template-identity.png) <br>&nbsp;

>In this step, Adobe Experience Platform checks for data usage policy violations. Shown below is an example where a policy is violated. You cannot complete the segment activation workflow until you have resolved the violation. For information on how to resolve policy violations, see [Policy enforcement](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-platform/data-governance/enforcement/auto-enforcement.html#enforcement) in the data governance documentation section.
