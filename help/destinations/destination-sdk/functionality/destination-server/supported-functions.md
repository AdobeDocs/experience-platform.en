# Supported transformation functions in Destination SDK

Experience Platform Destination SDK uses [[!DNL Pebble] templates](https://pebbletemplates.io/), allowing you to transform the data exported from Experience Platform into the format required by your destination.

The Experience Platform [!DNL Pebble] implementation has some changes, compared to the out-of-the box version provided by [!DNL Pebble]. Also, in addition to the out-of-the-box functions provided by [!DNL Pebble], Adobe has created some additional functions that you can use with Destination SDK.

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>All parameter names and values supported by Destination SDK are **case sensitive**. To avoid case sensitivity errors, please use the parameters names and values exactly as shown in the documentation.

## Where to use {#where-to-use}

Use the supported functions listed further below on this page when [creating a message transformation template](../../testing-api/streaming-destinations/create-template.md) for the data exported out of Experience Platform to your destination. 

The message transformation template is used in the [destination server configuration](templating-specs.md) for streaming destinations.

## Prerequisites {#prerequisites}

To understand the concepts and functions in this reference page, read the [message format](message-format.md) document first. You need to understand the [structure of a profile](message-format.md#profile-structure) in Experience Platform before you can use [!DNL Pebble] templates to transform and the exported data.

Before you advance to the functions documented below, review the templating examples in the section [Using a templating language for the identity, attributes, and segment membership transformations](message-format.md#using-templating). The examples in there start off very simple and increase in complexity.

## Supported [!DNL Pebble] functions {#supported-functions}

From the [!DNL Pebble] tags section, Destination SDK only supports:

* [filter](https://pebbletemplates.io/wiki/tag/filter/)
* [for](https://pebbletemplates.io/wiki/tag/for/)
* [if](https://pebbletemplates.io/wiki/tag/if/)
* [set](https://pebbletemplates.io/wiki/tag/set/)

>[!TIP]
>
>Using `for` is different when iterating through *array* or *map* elements in a template. When you iterate through an array, you can obtain the element directly. When you iterate through a map, you obtain each map entry, which has a key-value pair.
>
> * For an example of an array element, think about the identities in an [identityMap](message-format.md#identities) namespace, where you could iterate through elements such as `identityMap.gaid`, `identityMap.email`, or similar.
> * For an example of a map element, think about [segmentMembership](message-format.md#segment-membership).

From the [!DNL Pebble] filter section, Destination SDK supports all functions. An example further below shows how the `date` function can be used within Destination SDK.

From the [!DNL Pebble] functions section, Adobe does *not* support the [range](https://pebbletemplates.io/wiki/function/range/) function.

## Example of how the `date` function is used {#date-function}

To exemplify how [!DNL Pebble] functions are used in Destination SDK, see below how the date function ([link in Pebble documentation](https://pebbletemplates.io/wiki/filter/date/)) is used to transform the format of a timestamp.

### Use case

You want to change the `lastQualificationTime` timestamp from the default [ISO 8601](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601) value that Experience Platform exports to another value preferred by your destination.

### Example

#### Input

```json
{
"lastQualificationTime": "2022-02-08T18:34:24.000+0000"
}
```

#### Format

```java
{{ lastQualificationTime | date(existingFormat="yyyy-MM-dd'T'HH:mm:sss.SSSX", format="yyyy-MM-dd'T'HH:mm:ssX") }}
```

#### Output

```json
{
"lastQualificationTime": "2022-02-21T18:34:24Z"
}
```

## Functions added by Adobe {#functions-added-by-adobe}

In addition to the out-of-the-box functions provided by [!DNL Pebble], see below the additional functions created by Adobe that you can use for your data exports.

### `addedSegments` and `removedSegments` functions {#addedsegments-removedsegments-functions}

#### Use case

These functions can be used on order to obtain a list of segments that were added to or removed from a profile.

#### Example

##### Input

```json
{
  "identityMap": {
    "myIdNamespace": [
      {
        "id": "external_id1"
      },
      {
        "id": "external_id2"
      }
    ]
  },
  "segmentMembership": {
    "ups": {
      "111111": {
        "lastQualificationTime": "2019-11-20T13:15:49Z",
        "status": "realized"
      },
      "222222": {
        "lastQualificationTime": "2019-11-20T13:15:49Z",
        "status": "exited"
      },
      "333333": {
        "lastQualificationTime": "2019-11-20T13:15:49Z",
        "status": "realized"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

##### Format

```java
added: {% for s in addedSegments(segmentMembership.ups) %}<{{s.key}}>{% endfor %}; removed: {% for s in removedSegments(segmentMembership.ups) %}<{{s.key}}>{% endfor %}
```

##### Output

```json
added: <111111><333333>; removed: <222222>
```

<!--

### Added and removed segments filters {#added-and-removed-segmnts-filters}

#### Use case {#use-case}

These filters are similar to `addedSegments` and `removedSegments`, described above. The only difference is that they are implemented as filters as opposed to functions.

#### Example {#example}

##### Input {#input}

```json
{
  "identityMap": {
    "myIdNamespace": [
      {
        "id": "external_id1"
      },
      {
        "id": "external_id2"
      }
    ]
  },
  "segmentMembership": {
    "ups": {
      "111111": {
        "lastQualificationTime": "2019-11-20T13:15:49Z",
        "status": "realized"
      },
      "222222": {
        "lastQualificationTime": "2019-11-20T13:15:49Z",
        "status": "exited"
      },
      "333333": {
        "lastQualificationTime": "2019-11-20T13:15:49Z",
        "status": "realized"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

##### Format {#format}

```java
added: {% for s in input.profile.segmentMembership.ups | added %}<{{s.key}}>{% endfor %};|removed: {% for s in input.profile.segmentMembership.ups | removed %}<{{s.key}}>{% endfor %};
```

##### Output {#output}

```json
added: <111111><333333>;|removed: <222222>;
```
