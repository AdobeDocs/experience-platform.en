# Segment mapping configuration

This section of the destination configuration relates to how segment metadata like segment names or IDs should be shared between Experience Platform and your destination.

Through the `audienceTemplateId`, this section also ties together this configuration with the [audience metadata configuration](../audience-metadata-management.md).

The parameters shown in the configuration above are described in the [create a destination configuration](../../authoring-api/destination-configuration/create-destination-configuration.md).
