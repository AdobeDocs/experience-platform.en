# Create a destination publishing request

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>You only need to use this API endpoint if you are submitting a productized (public) destination, to be used by other Experience Platform customers. If you are creating a private destination for your own use, you do not need to formally submit the destination using the publishing API.

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>**API endpoint**: `platform.adobe.io/data/core/activation/authoring/destinations/publish` 

After you have configured and tested your destination, you can submit it to Adobe for review and publishing. Read [Submit for review a destination authored in Destination SDK](../guides/submit-destination.md) for all the other steps you must do as part of the destination submission process.

Use the publish destinations API endpoint to submit a publishing request when:

* As a Destination SDK partner, you want to make your productized destination available across all Experience Platform organizations for all Experience Platform customers to use;
* You make *any updates* to your configurations. Configuration updates are reflected in the destination only after you submit a new publishing request, which is approved by the Experience Platform team.

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>All parameter names and values supported by Destination SDK are **case sensitive**. To avoid case sensitivity errors, please use the parameters names and values exactly as shown in the documentation.
