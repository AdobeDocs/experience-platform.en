# Frequently asked questions {#faq}

## Overview {#overview}

This document provides answers to frequently asked questions about Adobe Experience Platform destinations. For questions and troubleshooting related to other [!DNL Platform] services, including those encountered across all [!DNL Platform] APIs, please refer to the [Experience Platform troubleshooting guide](../landing/troubleshooting.md).

## General destinations questions {#general}

**Why am I seeing different profile counts in the Experience Platform UI and in the exported CSV files?**

This is a normal behavior due to the way Experience Platform performs segmentation.

Streaming segmentation updates the profile count for streaming segments throughout the day, while batch segmentation updates the profile count for batch segments once every 24 hours.

When the segment export schedule differs from the segmentation schedule, the profile counts between the UI and the exported [!DNL CSV] file will be different, especially when it comes to streaming segments.

See the [Segmentation Service documentation](../segmentation/home.md) for more details.

## [!DNL Facebook Custom Audiences] {#facebook-faq}

**What do I need to do before I can activate audiences in [!DNL Facebook Custom Audiences]?**

Before you can send your audience segments to [!DNL Facebook], make sure you meet the following requirements:

* Your [!DNL Facebook] user account must have the **[!DNL Manage campaigns]** permission enabled for the Ad account that you plan to use.
* The **Adobe Experience Cloud** business account must be added as an advertising partner in your [!DNL Facebook Ad Account]. Use `business ID=206617933627973`. See [Add Partners to Your Business Manager](https://www.facebook.com/business/help/1717412048538897) in the Facebook documentation for details.
    >[!IMPORTANT]
    >
    > When configuring the permissions for Adobe Experience Cloud, you must enable the **Manage campaigns** permission. This is required for the [!DNL Adobe Experience Platform] integration.
* Read and sign the [!DNL Facebook Custom Audiences] Terms of Service. To do this, go to `https://business.facebook.com/ads/manage/customaudiences/tos/?act=[accountID]`, where `accountID` is your [!DNL Facebook Ad Account ID].

**Do I need to add any apps or pixels to my [!DNL Facebook] advertiser account?**

No. As this is not a pixel-based integration, there is no need to add any pixels to your advertiser account.

**How long does Facebook take to process information from Adobe Experience Platform?**

As of March 2021, [!DNL Facebook Custom Audiences] needs up to an hour to process information received from [!DNL Platform].

**Can I use [!DNL Facebook Custom Audiences] for audience targeting in other [!DNL Facebook] apps, like [!DNL Instagram]?**

You can use the [!DNL Facebook Custom Audiences] destination for audience targeting across Facebook's family of apps that are supported by [!DNL Facebook Custom Audiences], including [!DNL Facebook], [!DNL Instagram], [!DNL Audience Network], and [!DNL Messenger]. Selection of the app which advertisers want to run campaigns on is indicated at the placement level in [!DNL Facebook Ads Manager].

**What is the difference between the [!DNL Facebook Custom Audiences] connection and [!DNL Facebook Pixel] extension?**

The [!DNL Facebook Custom Audiences] connection uses [!DNL Platform] identities when sending audiences to [!DNL Facebook], while the [[!DNL Facebook Pixel] connection](../destinations/catalog/advertising/facebook-pixel.md) uses the [!DNL Facebook] pixel integrated in a website.

These two integrations are complementary; you can use both to ensure better audience coverage. As an example, you can use the [!DNL Facebook Pixel] extension for prospecting website visitors who have not created an account, whereas [!DNL Facebook Custom Audiences] can help you target existing customers, based on [!DNL Platform] identities.

**Does the Adobe Experience Platform integration with [!DNL Facebook Custom Audiences] support disqualifying users from an audience when they no longer qualify for it?**

Yes, the integration supports removing users from [!DNL Facebook Custom Audiences] when they no longer qualify.

**How should I hash the audience data before sending it to [!DNL Facebook]?**

[!DNL Facebook] requires that no personally identifiable information (PII) is sent in clear. Therefore, the audiences activated to [!DNL Facebook] can be keyed off *hashed* identifiers, such as email addresses or phone numbers.

For detailed explanations on the ID matching requirements, see [ID matching requirements](catalog/social/facebook.md#id-matching-requirements).

**What kind of identities can I activate in [!DNL Facebook Custom Audiences]?**

[!DNL Facebook Custom Audiences] supports the activation of the following identities: hashed emails, hashed phone numbers, [!DNL GAID], [!DNL IDFA], and custom external IDs.

Before you can use the [!UICONTROL LinkedIn Matched Audience] destination, make sure your [!DNL LinkedIn Campaign Manager] account has the [!DNL Creative Manager] permission level or higher.
