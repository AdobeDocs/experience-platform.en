# Accessibility in Adobe Experience Platform

Accessibility refers to a series of features that make a software product usable, with as little effort as possible, for users with visual, auditory, cognitive, motor, or other kinds of disabilities. Adobe is an industry leader in accessibility and supports the creation of outstanding web experiences by encouraging developers to produce rich, engaging content that is accessible to all users. For more details about Adobe's commitment to accessibility, see [Adobe Accessibility](https://www.adobe.com/accessibility.html).

Adobe Experience Platform is committed to providing accessible and inclusive features to all individuals, including users working with assistive devices such as speech recognition software and screen readers. Experience Platform is continuously enhanced to meet the needs of all types of users and adheres to worldwide standards that include individuals with visual, auditory, mobility, or other impairments.

Other accessibility features supported by Platform include keyboard navigation, semantic structure, sufficient contrast between foreground elements and background elements, assistive technology support, and clear element labels.
