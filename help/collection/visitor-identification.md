# Visitor identification

The Edge Network Server API supports [visitor identification via First-Party ID ([!DNL FPID])](visitor-identification-fpid.md).

All user identities should be supplied in the `identityMap` field group. This field group is included in the AEP Web SDK `ExperienceEvent` mixin.

```json
{
   "identityMap":{
      "FPID":[
         {
            "id":"55613368189701342632255821452918751312",
            "authenticatedState":"ambiguous"
         }
      ],
      "CRM":[
         {
            "id":"2394509340-30453470347",
            "authenticatedState":"authenticated"
         }
      ]
   }
}
```

## Device identifiers {#identifiers}

There are multiple ways in which a device can be identified within the Edge Network. See the table below for an overview of the supported IDs.

| ID namespace | Managed by | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `FPID` | Customer | `FPID` will be automatically encoded into an `ECID` by the Edge Network, therefore solutions which require an `ECID` will work as well.  <br><br> For consistent device identification, these IDs must be persisted on the device and supplied on each request. For web interactions, this involves storing them as browser cookies.|
| `IDFA`/`GAID` | Experience Platform | Can identify users across applications, so these IDs are not encoded into `ECID` by the Edge Network. |

<!--
| `ECID` | Adobe | `ECID` is required when leveraging and integrating with Adobe Analytics and Adobe Audience Manager. <br><br> For consistent device identification, these IDs must be persisted on the device and supplied on each request. For web interactions, this involves storing them as browser cookies. |

## Edge Network Identity Protocol {#experience-edge-identity-protocol}

Device identities like `ECID` must be persisted on the client device and supplied on each request in the session and across sessions. Having stable device identities across multiple sessions improves the accuracy levels in your reports and allows delivering a consistent experience to the visitors.

For all non-server interactions, the Edge Network will automatically perform the following actions:

* Generate a new `ECID` when none is found on the request. This will automatically enhance the collected event with the new identity.
* Return a `state:store` instruction to the caller with the `kndctr_{$IMS_ORG_ID|url-safe}_identity` entry, which contains:
  * The [ID value](#ee-identity-format)
  * A `maxAge` value, in seconds, indicating how long the client persist the ID for

For example, let's consider the following request:

```json
{
   "events":[
      {
         "xdm":{
            "eventType":"web.webpagedetails.pageViews",
            "eventMergeId":"0772675a-1e24-44ea-a92b-0138c1d03a38",
            "web":{
               "webPageDetails":{
                  "URL":"https://alloystore.dev/",
                  "name":"home-demo-Home Page",
                  "pageViews":{
                     "value":1
                  }
               }
            },
            "device":{
               "screenHeight":1120,
               "screenWidth":1792,
               "screenOrientation":"landscape"
            },
            "environment":{
               "type":"browser",
               "browserDetails":{
                  "viewportWidth":1792,
                  "viewportHeight":481
               }
            },
            "timestamp":"2021-08-09T14:09:20.859Z"
         }
      }
   ]
}
```

The Edge Network response includes a `state:store` handle, which, in turn, includes an entry with the following name format: `kndctr_{$IMS_ORG_ID|url-safe}_identity`.

```json
{
   "requestId":"f5abf988-15d1-4463-a3b8-59aa0709a808",
   "handle":[
      {
         "key":"kndctr_53A16ACB5CC1D3760A495C99_AdobeOrg_identity",
         "value":"CiYzOTMyMzQ5NzU1MDY0MzIxNzc3NDEzMjY2NDA4OTIzOTExNDgyMlIRCIbghtqyLxABGAEqBElSTDHwAYbghtqyLw==",
         "maxAge":34128000
      }
   ],
   "type":"state:store"
}
```

>[!NOTE]
>
>The `kndctr_{$IMS_ORG_ID|url-safe}_` prefix is also used for other entries stored on the client device, and enables state isolation for complex integrations, which could involve multiple/different organizations. While the Edge Network will filter the entries which can be used for a given datastream, in order to minimize the payload, the caller (SDK) should ideally ensure that only the relevant entries are sent.

The caller must:

* Store this value on the client device
* Supply it on subsequent calls from that device in the request `meta.state.entries[]`, as shown below:

```json
{
   "meta":{
      "state":{
         "entries":[
            {
               "key":"kndctr_53A16ACB5CC1D3760A495C99_AdobeOrg_identity",
               "value":"CiYzOTMyMzQ5NzU1MDY0MzIxNzc3NDEzMjY2NDA4OTIzOTExNDgyMlIRCIbghtqyLxABGAEqBElSTDHwAYbghtqyLw=="
            }
         ]
      }
   }
}
```

## Identity Protocol via cookies (web)

When using first-party domain CNAMEs for interacting with the Edge Network, the client state can be managed automatically via first-party cookies.

The caller must explicitly activate this functionality via the `meta.state.cookiesEnabled` flag:

```json
{
   "meta":{
      "state":{
         "domain":"alloystore.dev",
         "cookiesEnabled":true
      }
   }
}
```

>[!NOTE]
>
>The `meta.state.domain` is an optional value which a caller could supply, specifying the exact domain on which the cookies should be stored. When this is missing, the Edge Network can automatically infer the top-level domain from the request. Automatic client state management via browser cookies **should never be used** in a `server` interaction.
