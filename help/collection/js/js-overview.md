# JavaScript overview

The **Adobe Experience Platform Web SDK** is a client-side JavaScript library that allows you to send data to the Adobe Experience Platform Edge Network.

The Web SDK sends data in a solution-agnostic way (XDM) to the Experience Platform Edge Network, which then maps the data to solution-specific formats and destinations and sends it in real time.
