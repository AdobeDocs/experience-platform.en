# Visitor identification via FPID

[!DNL First-party IDs] (`FPIDs`) are device IDs generated, managed, and stored by customers. This gives customers control over identifying user devices. By sending `FPIDs`, the Edge Network does not generate a brand new `ECID` for a request that does not contain one.

The `FPID` can be included in the API request body as part of the `identityMap` or it can be sent as a cookie.

An `FPID` can be deterministically translated into an `ECID` by the Edge Network, so `FPID` identities are fully compatible with Experience Cloud solutions. Obtaining an `ECID` from a specific `FPID` always yields the same result, so users will have a consistent experience.

The `ECID` obtained this way can be retrieved via an `identity.fetch` query:

```json
{
   "query":{
      "identity":{
         "fetch":[
            "ECID"
         ]
      }
   }
}
```

For requests that contain both an `FPID` and an `ECID`, the `ECID` already present in the request will take precedence over the one that could be generated from the `FPID`. In other words, the Edge Network uses the `ECID` already provided and the `FPID` is ignored. A new `ECID` is only generated when an `FPID` is provided on its own.

In terms of device IDs, the `server` datastreams should use `FPID` as device ID. Other identities (i.e `EMAIL`) can also be provided within the request body, but the Edge Network requires that a primary identity is explicitly supplied. Primary identity is the base identity to which profile data will be stored in.

>[!NOTE]
>
>Requests that have no identity, respectively no primary identity explicitly set within the request body, will fail.

The following `identityMap` field group is correctly formed for a `server` datastream request:

```json
{
   "identityMap":{
      "FPID":[
         {
            "id":"123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000",
            "authenticatedState":"ambiguous",
            "primary":true
         }
      ],
      "EMAIL":[
         {
            "id":"email@mail.com",
            "authenticatedState":"authenticated"
         }
      ]
   }
}
```

The following `identityMap` field group will result in an error response when set on a `server` datastream request:

```json
{
   "identityMap":{
      "FPID":[
         {
            "id":"123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000",
            "authenticatedState":"ambiguous"
         }
      ],
      "EMAIL":[
         {
            "id":"email@mail.com",
            "authenticatedState":"authenticated"
         }
      ]
   }
}
```

The error response returned by the Edge Network in this case is similar to the following:

```json
{
   "type":"https://ns.adobe.com/aep/errors/EXEG-0306-400",
   "status":400,
   "title":"No primary identity set in request (event)",
   "detail":"No primary identity found in the input event. Update the request accordingly to your schema and try again.",
   "report":{
      "requestId":"{REQUEST_ID}",
      "configId":"{CONFIG_ID}",
      "orgId":"{ORG_ID}"
   }
}
```

## Visitor identification with `FPID`

To identify users via `FPID`, ensure that the `FPID` cookie has been sent prior to making any requests to the Edge Network. The `FPID` can be passed in a cookie or as part of the `identityMap` in the body of the request.

## Request with `FPID` passed as `identityMap` field

The example below passes the [!DNL FPID] as an `identityMap` parameter.

-H "Authorization: Bearer {TOKEN}"
-H "x-gw-ims-org-id: {ORG_ID}"
