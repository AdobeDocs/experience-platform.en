# UI guide

To use a playbook, go to **Marketer Playground > Playbooks**

## Sort and filter

Use the search window and filters available on the page to find the right playbook for your use case. 

For example, you can find the playbook that will help you launch a new product.

Or, you can filter the available playbooks by the channels that you plan to use to reach your customers.
