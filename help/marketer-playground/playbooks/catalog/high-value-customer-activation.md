## Use case

Use the high-value customer activation playbook to identify and contact high value customers.

## Start a new project using the playbook

When you are ready to proceed, select **Create new project with this playbook**. The [UI guide](/help/marketer-playground/playbooks/ui-guide.md) contains all the information you need about how to create a new project using the playbooks.

## Created artifacts

Experience Platform automatically creates several artifacts that you can use to accomplish the use case of this playbook.

Experience Platform creates two schemas for you to use as part of this project - **Customer digital transactions** and **Customer offline transactions**.

Use these schemas as a base to accomplish the use case in this playbook.
