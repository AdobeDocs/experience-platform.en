# (Beta) CDP Insights Data Model

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>The CDP Insights Data Models feature is in beta. Its features and documentation are subject to change.

The CDP Insights Data Model feature exposes the data models and SQL that powers the insights for various profile, destination, and segmentation widgets. You can customize these SQL query templates to create bespoke CDP reports for your marketing and KPI use cases. These insights can then be used as custom widgets for your used defined dashboards.

## Prerequisites

This guide requires a working understanding of [the user-defined dashboards feature](./user-defined-dashboards.md). Please read the documentation before continuing with this guide.

## CDP insight reports and use cases

CDP reporting provides insights into your profile data and its relationship with segments and destinations. Various star schema models were developed to answer a variety of common marketing use cases and each data model can support several use cases.

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>The data used for CDP reporting is accurate for a chosen merge policy and from the most recent daily snapshot.

### Profile model {#profile-model}

The profile model is comprised of three datasets: 

- `adwh_dim_date`
- `adwh_fact_profile`
- `adwh_dim_merge_policies`

The image below contains the relevant data fields in each.

![An ERD of the profile model.](./images/cdp-insights/profile-model.png)

#### The profile count use case

The logic used for the profile count widget returns the total number of merged profiles within the Profile Store at the time the snapshot was taken. See the [[!UICONTROL Profile count] widget documentation](./guides/profiles.md#profile-count) for more information.
