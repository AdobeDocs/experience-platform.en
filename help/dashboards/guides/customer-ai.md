### Customer AI widgets {#customer-ai-widgets}

Customer AI is used to generate custom propensity scores such as churn and conversion for individual profiles at-scale. Customer AI does this by analyzing existing consumer Experience Event data to predict churn or conversion propensity scores. These high accuracy customer propensity models allow for more exact segmentation and targeting. The [distribution of scores](#customer-ai-distribution-of-scores) and [scoring summary](#customer-ai-scoring-summary) insights demonstrate the division in your audience. They highlight which profiles are the high/low/medium propensity and how they are distributed across your profile counts.
