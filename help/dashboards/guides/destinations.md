# [!UICONTROL Destinations] dashboard

The Adobe Experience Platform user interface (UI) provides a dashboard through which you can view important information about your organization's active destinations, as captured during a daily snapshot. This guide outlines how to access and work with the destinations dashboard in the UI and provides more information regarding the metrics displayed in the dashboard.  

For an overview of destinations, as well as a catalog of all available destinations within Experience Platform, please visit the [destinations documentation](../../destinations/home.md).

## [!UICONTROL Destinations] dashboard data {#destinations-dashboard-data}

The Destinations dashboard displays a snapshot of the destinations that your organization has enabled within Experience Platform. The data in the snapshot shows the data exactly as it appears at the specific point in time when the snapshot was taken. In other words, the snapshot is not an approximation or sample of the data, and the destinations dashboard is not updating in real-time.

>[!NOTE]
>
>Any changes or updates made to the data since the snapshot was taken will not be reflected in the dashboard until the next snapshot is taken.

## Explore the [!UICONTROL Destinations] dashboard {#explore}

To navigate to the destinations dashboard within the Platform UI, select **[!UICONTROL Destinations]** in the left rail, then select the **[!UICONTROL Overview]** tab to display the dashboard.

The date and time of the most recent snapshot is displayed at the top of the [!UICONTROL Overview] next to the destination dropdown. All widget data is accurate as of that date and time. The timestamp of the snapshot is provided in UTC; it is not in the timezone of the individual user or organization.

>[!NOTE]
>
>If your organization is new to Experience Platform and does not yet have active destinations, the Destinations dashboard and [!UICONTROL Overview] tab are not visible. Instead, selecting [!UICONTROL Destinations] from the left navigation displays the [!UICONTROL Catalog] tab. To learn more about the [!UICONTROL Catalog] tab, refer to the [[!UICONTROL Destinations] workspace guide](../../destinations/ui/destinations-workspace.md).

![The Platform UI Destinations Overview with the most recent snapshot highlighted.](../images/destinations/snapshot-timestamp.png)

### Modify the [!UICONTROL Destinations] dashboard {#modify}

Select **[!UICONTROL Modify dashboard]** to change the appearance of the destinations dashboard. Changes to the dashboard are per user and not organization wide. You can move, add, resize, and remove widgets from the dashboard and access the widget library to customize your dashboard. From the widget library, you can explore the available widgets and create custom widgets for your organization. 

Please refer to the [modifying dashboards](../customize/modify.md) and [widget library overview](../customize/widget-library.md) documentation to learn more.

### Add widgets {#add-widget}

Select **[!UICONTROL Add widget]** to navigate to the widget library and see a list of the available widgets to add to your dashboard.

![The Destinations dashboard overview with Add widget highlighted.](../images/destinations/destinations-overview-add-widget.png)

From the widget library, you can browse the selection of standard and custom audience widgets. For information on how to add widgets, please see the widget library documentation on how to [add a widget](../customize/widget-library.md#add-widgets).

### View SQL {#view-sql}

You can view the SQL that generates the insights visualized on your dashboard with a toggle on the [!UICONTROL Overview] workspace. You can take inspiration from the SQL of your existing insights to create new queries that derive unique insights from Platform data based on your business needs. To learn more about this feature, see the [View SQL UI guide](../view-sql.md).

## Default widgets {#default-widgets}

A default widget load-out is provided for all new instances of Adobe Experience Platform that highlights the latest available insights from your data. The following widgets are pre-configured in your segments view from the outset. Full details on the purpose and function of the widgets can be found below.

* [[!UICONTROL Most used destinations]](#most-used-destinations)
* [[!UICONTROL Recently created destinations]](#recently-created-destinations)
* [[!UICONTROL Recently activated segments]](#recently-activated-segments)

>[!NOTE]
>
>As of July 26th 2023, [!UICONTROL Profiles], [!UICONTROL Audiences], and [!UICONTROL Destinations] Overview dashboards have been reset to a new default widget load-out for all users who did not modify their views in the previous six months. 
>Refer to the documentation in the [Profiles](./profiles.md#default-widgets) and [Audiences](./audiences.md#default-widgets) default widget sections for details on which widgets are included as part of the default widget load-outs. You can continue to customize your dashboard widgets as before.

## Standard widgets {#standard-widgets}

Adobe provides multiple standard widgets that you can use to visualize different metrics related to your destinations and assess the completeness of the audiences available for your data analysis. You can also create custom widgets to be shared with your organization using the [!UICONTROL Widget library]. To learn more about creating custom widgets, please begin by reading the [Widget library overview](../customize/widget-library.md).

>title="Most used destinations"
>abstract="This widget displays your organization's most active destinations by the number of mapped audiences. These numbers are accurate at the time of the last snapshot. This ranking provides insight into which destinations are currently most used while highlighting those that may be underutilized."

The **[!UICONTROL Most used destinations]** widget displays your organization's top destinations by the number of mapped audiences, as of the last snapshot. This ranking provides insight into which destinations are being utilized while also potentially showing those that may be underutilized. 

For example, if you configured a destination yesterday but have not mapped any audiences to it, you would be able to see that the destination is currently underutilized.

The number of mapped audiences shown in the [!UICONTROL Audience count] column is accurate as of the last daily snapshot. Mapping a new audience to the destination does not update the count until the next snapshot is taken.

Select the name of a destination from the list shown on the widget to navigate to the destination details for that particular destination. You can also select **[!UICONTROL View All]** to navigate to the **[!UICONTROL Browse]** tab and then select the name of a destination to view its details.

>[!CONTEXTUALHELP]
>id="platform_dashboards_destinations_recentlycreateddestinations"
>title="Recently created destinations"
>abstract="This widget displays a list of the most recently configured destinations within your organization."

The **[!UICONTROL Recently created destinations]** widget enables you to see a list of your organization's most recently configured destinations. 

The created date shown is accurate to the last daily snapshot. In other words, if you create a new destination, it will not appear in the list until after the next snapshot is taken.

Selecting the name of a destination from the list shown on the widget will take you to the destination details as linked from the **[!UICONTROL Browse]** tab. You can also select **[!UICONTROL View All]** to navigate to the **[!UICONTROL Browse]** tab and then select the name of a destination to view its details.

![The Mapped audiences by identity widget.](../images/destinations/mapped-audiences-by-identity.png)

The **[!UICONTROL Mapped audiences by identity]** widget highlights at a glance, the likelihood of successfully targeting profile opportunities for a campaign within the chosen destination. An efficient targeted campaign does not depend on the number of profiles sent to the destination but rather the number of source IDs that are likely to be matched with the destination IDs to provide useful and actionable data.  

### Common audiences {#common-audiences}

>[!CONTEXTUALHELP]
>id="platform_dashboards_destinations_commonaudiences"
>title="Common audiences"

It provides a calculated metric for the dispersion of audience sizes from the mean over the last 30 days. The audience sizes are sorted from high to low."

The widget provides a list of up to 20 mapped audiences whose total profile counts, as of the last daily snapshot, deviate by a factor of at least one standard deviation from the 30 days mean audience size mapped to that destination.

In brief, it provides a calculated metric for the dispersion of audience sizes from the mean over the last 30 days. It compares whether today's audience size is outside of the historic standard deviation seen in the data over the past 30 days.

All audience sizes in the system are sorted from high to low audience size, as indicated in the [!UICONTROL LATEST SIZE] column. 

If your mapped audience profile count is outside one standard deviation from the average mapped profile size over the past 30 days, this indicates an anomaly in the system and it should be investigated.

If an audience within the [!UICONTROL Mapped audience health] widget is deviating by a wide margin, you should refer to the audience size trend chart and locate the anomalous audience. The trend can provide further insight into your audience's health.  

>[!NOTE]
>
>The default size of the Mapped audience health widget can obstruct the table information. Please modify the size of the widget to improve the legibility of your mapped audience names and column titles.
