# [!UICONTROL Destinations] dashboard

The Adobe Experience Platform user interface (UI) provides a dashboard through which you can view important information about your organization's active destinations, as captured during a daily snapshot. This guide outlines how to access and work with the destinations dashboard in the UI and provides more information regarding the metrics displayed in the dashboard.  

For an overview of destinations, as well as a catalog of all available destinations within Experience Platform, please visit the [destinations documentation](../../destinations/home.md).

## [!UICONTROL Destinations] dashboard data {#destinations-dashboard-data}

The [!UICONTROL Destinations] dashboard displays a snapshot of the destinations that your organization has enabled within Experience Profile. The data in the snapshot shows the data exactly as it appears at the specific point in time when the snapshot was taken. In other words, the snapshot is not an approximation or sample of the data, and the destinations dashboard is not updating in real time.

>[!NOTE]
>
>Any changes or updates made to the data since the snapshot was taken will not be reflected in the dashboard until the next snapshot is taken.

## Exploring the destinations dashboard

To navigate to the destinations dashboard within the Platform UI, select **[!UICONTROL Destinations]** in the left rail, then select the **[!UICONTROL Overview]** tab to display the dashboard.

>[!NOTE]
>
>If your organization is new to Experience Platform and does not yet have active destinations, the [!UICONTROL Destinations] dashboard and [!UICONTROL Overview] tab are not visible. Instead, selecting [!UICONTROL Destinations] from the left navigation displays the [!UICONTROL Catalog] tab. To learn more about the [!UICONTROL Catalog] tab, refer to the [[!UICONTROL Destinations] workspace guide](../../destinations/ui/destinations-workspace.md).

### Modifying the destinations dashboard

You can modify the appearance of the destinations dashboard by selecting **[!UICONTROL Modify dashboard]**. This enables you to move, add, and remove widgets from the dashboard as well as to access the **[!UICONTROL Widget library]** to explore available widgets and create custom widgets for your organization. 

Please refer to the [modifying dashboards](../customize/modify.md) and [widget library overview](../customize/widget-library.md) documentation to learn more.

## Standard widgets

Adobe provides multiple standard widgets that you can use to visualize different metrics related to your destinations. You can also create custom widgets to be shared with your organization using the [!UICONTROL Widget library]. To learn more about creating custom widgets, please begin by reading the [widget library overview](../customize/widget-library.md).

To learn more about each of the available standard widgets, select the name of a widget from the following list:

* [[!UICONTROL Most used destinations]](#most-used-destinations)
* [[!UICONTROL Recently created destinations]](#recently-created-destinations)
* [[!UICONTROL Recently activated segments]](#recently-activated-segments)

### [!UICONTROL Most used destinations] {#most-used-destinations}

The **[!UICONTROL Most used destinations]** widget displays your organization's top destinations by number of segments mapped, as of the last snapshot. This ranking provides insight into which destinations are being utilized while also potentially showing those that may be underutilized. 

For example, if you configured a destination yesterday but have not mapped any segments to it, you would be able to see that the destination is currently underutilized.

The number of mapped segments shown in the segment count column is accurate as of the last daily snapshot. Mapping a new segment to the destination will not update the count until the next snapshot is taken.

Selecting the name of a destination from the list shown on the widget will take you to the destination details as linked from the **[!UICONTROL Browse]** tab. You can also select **[!UICONTROL View All]** to navigate to the **[!UICONTROL Browse]** tab and then select the name of a destination to view its details.

### [!UICONTROL Recently created destinations] {#recently-created-destinations}

The **[!UICONTROL Recently created destinations]** widget enables you to see a list of your organization's most recently configured destinations. 

The created date shown is accurate to the last daily snapshot. In other words, if you create a new destination, it will not appear in the list until after the next snapshot is taken.

Selecting the name of a destination from the list shown on the widget will take you to the destination details as linked from the **[!UICONTROL Browse]** tab. You can also select **[!UICONTROL View All]** to navigate to the **[!UICONTROL Browse]** tab and then select the name of a destination to view its details.

To learn more about how to configure specific types of destinations, visit the [destinations documentation](../../destinations/home.md).

### [!UICONTROL Recently activated segments] {#recently-activated-segments}

The **[!UICONTROL Recently activated segments]** widget provides a list of the segments most recently mapped to a destination. This list provides a snapshot of what segments and destinations are actively in use in the system and can help in troubleshooting any erroneous mappings. 

The updated date shown displays the last time the segment was activated to the destination and is accurate to the last daily snapshot. In other words, if you activate a segment to the destination, the updated date will not change until after the next snapshot is taken.

Selecting the name of a segment from the list shown on the widget will take you to the segment details. You can also select **[!UICONTROL View All]** to navigate to the segment browse tab and then select the name of a segment to view its details.

For more information on working with segments in Experience Platform, please begin by reading the [Segmentation Service overview](../../segmentation/home.md).
