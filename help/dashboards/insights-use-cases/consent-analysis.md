# Consent analysis and tracking

In today's marketing landscape, it is critical to understand and respect customer consent preferences. Adobe Real-Time Customer Data Platform provides the ability for marketers to analyze customer consent to build trust, comply with privacy regulations, and deliver more personalized experiences.

This document details how to build a consent dashboard for a variety of marketing use cases for Real-Time CDP data.

## Use cases

The use cases covered in this guide are consent trending and consent overlap.

- **Consent Trending**: This tracks how user consent has trended over time. Analyzing consent preference changes helps marketers plan and execute campaigns that adapt to those user preference changes. For example, you may want to run targeted educational campaigns, transparency and trust campaigns, or incentive campaigns to respectfully drive consent choices. You could also correlate campaigns that might have been negatively impacting consent to proactively reduce the frequency of those campaigns.
- **Consent Overlap**: You can use the overlap among consent channels to deliver consistent personalized messaging on multiple channels for the users who have consented to multiple channels. Marketers can prioritize and allocate resources to certain channels where there is a higher degree of consent and personalized messaging might resonate with customers thereby generating higher response rates.
