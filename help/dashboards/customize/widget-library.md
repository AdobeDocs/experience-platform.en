# Widget library overview

Within the Adobe Experience Platform user interface, you can view and interact with your organization's data using multiple dashboards. You can also update certain dashboards by adding widgets to your dashboard view. 

This guide provides step-by-step instructions for accessing the [!UICONTROL Widget library] within Experience Platform, where you can select standard widgets and create custom widgets to customize the information that is displayed within your dashboards.

For information on how to modify the location and size of the widgets already displayed in your dashboards, please refer to the [modify dashboards guide](modify.md).

>[!NOTE]
>
>The widgets shown in the [!UICONTROL License usage] dashboard cannot be customized. To learn more about this unique dashboard, read the [license usage dashboard documentation](../guides/license-usage.md).

## Access the widget library

From any dashboard (for example, the Profiles dashboard), select **[!UICONTROL Modify dashboard]** in order to display the **[!UICONTROL Widget library]** button.

## Standard and custom widgets

The [!UICONTROL Widget library] contains two tabs:

* **[!UICONTROL Standard]:** The standard tab contains widgets provided by Adobe. You can update your dashboards using any of these standard metrics. To learn more about adding standard widgets to your dashboard, refer to the guide for [using standard widgets in dashboards](standard-widgets.md).
* **[!UICONTROL Custom]:** The custom tab allows you to create and share widgets within your organization. For complete steps to creating your own widgets, refer to the [custom widgets for dashboards guide](custom-widgets.md).
