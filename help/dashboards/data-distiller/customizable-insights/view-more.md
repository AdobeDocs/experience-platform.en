# View more {#view-more}

Once you have created a [custom insight](./overview.md) with [query pro mode](./query-pro-mode.md), you can view your chart data in differnt formats. You can view either a tabulated form of the results, or download the data as a CSV file to view in a spreadsheet.

## Tabulated results {#tabulated-results}

For every chart authored using the query Pro mode through SQL, you can view the tabulated results of your analysis within the Experience Platform UI. 

From your custom dashboard, select the ellipses (`...`) on any widget to access the [!UICONTROL View more] and [!UICONTROL View SQL] options.
