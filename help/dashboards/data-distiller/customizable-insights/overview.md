# Customizable Insights for extended app reporting

Use custom SQL queries to effectively extract insights from diverse structured datasets. Technical people can use 'query pro-mode' to perform complex analysis with SQL and then share this analysis with non-technical users through charts on your custom dashboard or export them in CSV files. This method of insight creation is well-suited for tables with clear relationships and allows for a greater degree of customization within your insights and filters that can suit niche use cases. 

>[!IMPORTANT]

>Query pro-mode is only available to users who have purchased the Data Distiller SKU.

To generate insights from SQL, you must first create a dashboard.

## Create a custom dashboard {#create-custom-dashboard}

To create a custom dashboard, select **[!UICONTROL Dashboards]** from the left navigation panel to open the Dashboards workspace. Next, select **[!UICONTROL Create dashboard]**.

The **[!UICONTROL Create dashboard]** dialog appears. There are two options from which to choose your dashboard creation method. To create your insights you can either use an existing data model with the [[!UICONTROL Guided design mode]](./user-defined-dashboards.md) or your own SQL with the [!UICONTROL Query pro mode]. 

<!-- Maybe reference Guided design mode in other places on UDD doc. -->

Using an existing data model has the benefits of providing a structured, efficient, and scalable framework tailored to your specific business needs. To learn how to [create insights from an existing data model](./user-defined-dashboards.md#create-widget), refer to the custom dashboard guide.

Insights generated from SQL queries offer far greater flexibility and customization. Technical people can use 'query pro-mode' to perform complex analysis on SQL and then share this analysis with non-technical users through this dashboard capability. Select **[!UICONTROL Query pro mode]** followed by **[!UICONTROL Save]**.

>Once you make a selection, you cannot change this selection within that dashboard. Instead, you must create a new dashboard with a different dashboard creation method.

## Create a chart {#create-a-chart}

See the [query pro mode guide](./query-pro-mode.md) for step-by-step instructions on creating a chart with SQL.
