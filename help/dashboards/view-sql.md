# View insight SQL

Use the [!UICONTROL View SQL] feature to view the SQL behind your Profile, Audience, Destination, and custom insights and execute the query on demand through the Query Editor. You can take inspiration from the SQL of over 40 existing insights to create new queries that derive unique insights from Platform data based on your business needs.


Select either **[!UICONTROL Profiles]**, **[!UICONTROL Audiences]**, or **[!UICONTROL Destinations]** from the left navigation to open their respective dashboards. Next select **[!UICONTROL Overview]** from the tab options if the workspace does not automatically appear.

<!-- Directions for User-defined dashboards -->

A toggle is available from the overview of the Profile, Audience, Destination, and user-defined dashboards to enable or disable the feature.
