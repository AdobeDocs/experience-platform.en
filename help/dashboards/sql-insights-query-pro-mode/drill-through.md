# Drill through {#drill-through}

Drill throughs facilitate multi-layered data analysis by making it simple to navigate from any chart to a new dashboard. This feature makes it easy to transition from high-level overviews to in-depth reports when studying trends, customer behavior, operational indicators, and more, ensuring that you always have the context you need.

The system ensures that the analysis you begin is seamlessly continued throughout the full drill through experience by automatically passing global filters and date range filters from the source dashboards to the target dashboards.Â For ease of navigation between various layers of the study, the system allows multi-level drill throughs.
