# Advanced Audience Overlaps

<!-- Still in draft -->

The [!UICONTROL Advanced Audience Overlaps] dashboard helps you understand how different audience segments intersect, allowing you to make informed decisions regarding audience segmentation and targeting strategies. 
<!-- This dashboard provides tabulated metrics to help you understand the relationships between audience groups. Which in turn, leads to better-targeted campaigns, a reduced overlap in messaging, and more efficient marketing efforts. -->

From this dashboard you can 
select specific audiences for overlap analysis and examine metrics to optimize engagement. 
easily review audience intersections, apply filters, and perform overlap analysis.

## Filter Audiences {#filter-audiences}

To filter specific audiences for overlap analysis, select the filter icon (![The filter icon.]()) to open the [!UICONTROL Filter] dialog. From here, you can add or remove audiences from the overlap template to refine your analysis.

The [!UICONTROL Filters] dialog appears. To choose an audience for overlap analysis, select an audience name from the **[!UICONTROL Audience]** dropdown. The name of any audience you add is displayed with a tag below the dropdown. Once added, you can select the 'x' by their name to remove them. To remove all applied filters, select **[!UICONTROL Clear all]**, if needed.

## Applied filters {#applied-filters}

In the current example, a filter is applied for [!UICONTROL Audience: Canada - Alberta], which narrows down the audience data displayed. Any additional audiences you choose to add are displayed next to the [!UICONTROL Filtering by] tag above the advianced Audience overlap chart.

## Advanced Audience Overlaps Table {#advanced-audience-overlaps-table}

The main section of the dashboard displays the [!UICONTROL Advanced Audience Overlaps] table, which provides a detailed comparison of audience overlaps between different segments. The table columns are as follows:

- **[!UICONTROL Source_Segment_Name]**: The original audience being analyzed (e.g., "Canada - Alberta").
- **[!UICONTROL Overlap_Segment_Name]**: The audience with which overlaps are being compared (e.g., "Western Canada" or "Winter wear").
- **[!UICONTROL Source_Segment_Audience_Count]**: The size of the source audience.
- **[!UICONTROL Overlap_Segment_Audience_Count]**: The size of the overlapping audience, which varies depending on the overlap.
- **[!UICONTROL Overlap_Audience_Count]**: The size of the actual overlapping audience between the source and overlap segments.

## Export Insights {#export-insights}

After you've filtered and analyzed the audiences, you can export the data for further offline analysis or reporting purposes. To export your insights, select **[!UICONTROL Export]** on the top right of the table. The print PDF dialog appears, allowing you to save the data as a PDF or print it.
