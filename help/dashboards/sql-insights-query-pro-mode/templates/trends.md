# Audience Trends

Analyze how your audiences change over time with visualizations of key audience metrics on the [!UICONTROL Audience Trends] dashboard. This dashboard helps you track trends such as audience growth, the number of identities, and the count of single identity profiles, and empowers you to make data-driven decisions. By analyzing these metrics, marketers can optimize targeting strategies, improve audience engagement, and refine their segmentation efforts for more effective campaigns.

## Filtering audiences {#filter-audiences}

To begin your analysis, use the global filter to select the specific audiences and the date range you wish to analyze. Select the filter icon (![The filter icon.](../../../images/icons/filter-icon-white.png)) to open the **[!UICONTROL Filter]** dialog, where you can:

1. **Select an audience**: Choose the audience you wish to analyze (in the example screenshot, the **Amoxicillin** audience has been selected).
1. **Set a date range**: Choose a predefined range from the dropdown menu or manually select start and end dates using the calendar fields.

For each chart, you can select the ellipse (`...`) in the top right followed by [!UICONTROL View more] to view either a tabulated form of the results, or download the data as a CSV file to view in a spreadsheet.
