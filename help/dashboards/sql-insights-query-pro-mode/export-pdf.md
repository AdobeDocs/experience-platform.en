# Export PDF {#export-pdf}

Once you have created a [custom insight](./overview.md) with [query pro mode](./overview.md#query-pro-mode), you can export your chart data in PDF format. This action is taken from your custom dashboard overview. 

From the dashboards workspace, select a custom dashboard from the inventory listed in the [!UICONTROL Browse] tab.
