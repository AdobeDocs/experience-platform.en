# View configured dashboards in Experience Platform

If your organization has multiple dashboards available within Adobe Experience Platform, you can review these dashboards within the user interface.

## View list of dashboards

In order to view the dashboards that your organization has configured, select **[!UICONTROL Dashboards]** in the left navigation and then select the **[!UICONTROL Browse]** tab.

The list includes all dashboards available on your Platform instance, including integrated dashboards created by your organization that have been configured through third party applications.

## View an individual dashboard

You can view an individual dashboard by selecting the name of the dashboard from the list.

When selected, the dashboard opens either in the Platform UI or in a fully integrated application workspace that requires you to log in using the necessary credentials.
