# View Configured Dashboards in Experience Platform

Your organization has multiple dashboards available within Adobe Experience Platform. This guide provides steps for reviewing the list of dashboards using the Experience Platform user interface.

## View list of dashboards

In order to view the dashboards that your organization has configured within Experience Platform, select **[!UICONTROL Dashboards]** in the left navigation and then select the **[!UICONTROL Browse]** tab.

The list of dashboards includes all dashboards available on Experience Platform, including integrated dashboards created by your organization that have been configured through third party applications.

## View individual dashboard

You can view an individual dashboard by selecting the name of the dashboard from the list.

When a dashboard is selected, it will either open in the Platform UI or in a fully integrated application workspace that requires you to log in using the necessary credentials in order to view the dashboard.
