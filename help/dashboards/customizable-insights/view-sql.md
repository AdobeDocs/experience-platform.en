To view the SQL behind your customized insights, select the **[!UICONTROL View SQL]** option. The dialog is titled with the name of the insight. From this view, you can copy the SQL to your clipboard to use as a base in a future query, or open the SQL directly in the query pro mode editor. Select **[!UICONTROL Run SQL]** to open the query pro mode.
