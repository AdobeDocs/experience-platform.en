# Customizable Insights for extended app reporting

You can use custom SQL queries to effectively extract insights from diverse structured datasets. This method of insight creation is well-suited for tables with clear relationships. It allows for a greater degree of customization within your insights and filters that can suit niche use cases. You can also do complex analysis in SQL and then retain the output of that analysis as a chart for non-technical users.

<!-- 
Technical people can use 'query pro-mode' to perform complex analysis on SQL and then share this analysis with non-technical users through this dashboard capability.

>Query pro-mode is only available to users who have purchased the Data Distiller SKU.

To generate insights from SQL, you must first create a dashboard.

## Create a custom dashboard {#create-custom-dashboard}

To create a custom dashboard, select **[!UICONTROL Dashboards]** from the left navigation panel to open the Dashboards workspace. Next, select **[!UICONTROL Create dashboard]**.

The **[!UICONTROL Create dashboard]** dialog appears. There are two options from which to choose your dashboard creation method. To create your insights you can either use an existing data model with the [[!UICONTROL Guided design mode]](./user-defined-dashboards.md) or your own SQL with the [!UICONTROL Query pro mode]. 

<!-- Maybe reference Guided design mode in other places on UDD doc. -->

Using an existing data model has the benefits of providing a structured, efficient, and scalable framework tailored to your specific business needs. To learn how to [create insights from an existing data model](./user-defined-dashboards.md#create-widget), refer to the custom dashboard guide.

Insights generated from SQL queries offer far greater flexibility and customization. Technical people can use 'query pro-mode' to perform complex analysis on SQL and then share this analysis with non-technical users through this dashboard capability. Select **[!UICONTROL Query pro mode]** followed by **[!UICONTROL Save]**.

>[!NOTE]
>
>Once you make a selection, you cannot change this selection within that dashboard. Instead, create a new dashboard that uses a different insight creation method.
