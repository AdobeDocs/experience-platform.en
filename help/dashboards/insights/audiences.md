# Audiences insights

The insights derived from the analysis of your data model make your Adobe Real-time Customer Data Platform data more accessible, understandable, and impactful for decision-making.
 
Understand your audience insights by accessing the SQL that powers them, then generate your own insights to further explore the identities and profiles that make up your audiences. Transform your raw data into new actionable insights by using the existing Real-Time CDP data model SQL as inspiration to create queries for your unique business needs. 

<!-- This link will go in during the January release.
See the [View SQL documentation]() for more information on how to adapt your insights' SQL directly through the PLatform UI.  -->

The following insights are all available for you to use as part of the [Audiences dashboard](../guides/audiences.md) or a custom [user-defined dashboard](../user-defined-dashboards.md). See the [customization overview](../customize/overview.md) for instructions on how to customize your dashboard or [create and edit new widgets](../customize/custom-widgets.md) in the widget library and [user-defined dashboard](../user-defined-dashboards.md#create-widget).
