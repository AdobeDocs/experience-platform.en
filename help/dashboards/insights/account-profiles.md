# Account Profile insights

<!-- Description in progress. -->

The insights derived from the analysis of your data model make your Adobe Real-time Customer Data Platform data more accessible, understandable, and impactful for decision-making.
 
Understand your account account profile insights by accessing the SQL that powers them, then generate your own insights to further explore your customer account information. Transform your raw data into new actionable insights by using the existing Real-Time CDP data model SQL as inspiration to create queries for your unique business needs. 

The following insights are all available for you to use as part of the [Account Profiles dashboard](../guides/account-profiles.md) or a custom [user-defined dashboard](../user-defined-dashboards.md). See the [customization overview](../customize/overview.md) for instructions on how to customize your dashboard or [create and edit new widgets](../customize/custom-widgets.md) in the widget library and [user-defined dashboard](../user-defined-dashboards.md#create-widget). 

<!-- Account profiles enable you to unify account information from multiple sources. This unified view of an account brings together data from across your many marketing channels and the diverse systems that your organization is currently using to store customer account data.

By stitching together account data from different sources, you can begin to see a complete picture of each of your customer accounts and its related opportunities and contacts. This enables your organization to take your B2B marketing campaigns to a new level. -->
