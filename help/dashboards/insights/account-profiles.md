# Account Profile insights

[Account profiles](../../rtcdp/accounts/account-profile-overview.md) are used to consolidate account information from various sources, including multiple marketing channels and organizational systems. This unified view enables a comprehensive understanding of customer accounts, enhancing B2B marketing campaigns. The insights derived from the analysis of your data model make your Adobe Real-Time CDP B2B data more accessible, understandable, and impactful for decision-making.

With access to the SQL that powers your insights, you can better understand your B2B data and generate your own highly customized reusable insights to further explore your customer account information. Transform your raw data into new actionable insights by using the existing Real-Time CDP data model SQL as inspiration to create queries for your unique business needs. 

<!-- Add link to new generate insights with SQL workflow doc after April release.-->

The following insights are all available for you to use as part of the [Account Profiles dashboard](../guides/account-profiles.md) or a [custom dashboard](../standard-dashboards.md). See the [customization overview](../customize/overview.md) for instructions on how to customize your dashboard or [create and edit new widgets](../customize/custom-widgets.md) in the widget library and [user-defined dashboard](../standard-dashboards.md#create-widget).

## Customers per Account Overview {#customers-per-account-overview}

>[!NOTE]

>The [!UICONTROL Customers per Account Overview] chart includes three drill-through insights: [!UICONTROL Customers per Account Detail], [!UICONTROL Opportunities per Account Overview], and [!UICONTROL Opportunities per Account Detail]. These drill-throughs provide more granular insights, breaking down customer and opportunity counts by categories (such as direct and indirect customers) and ranges (like customer and opportunity count bands). These charts are unaffected by any global date filters you may have set.

## Next steps

By reading this document, you now understand the SQL that generates account profile dashboard insights and what common questions this analysis solves. You can now edit and iterate on the SQL to generate your own insights. Refer to the [Query Pro Mode overview](../sql-insights-query-pro-mode/overview.md) to learn how to generate custom insights with SQL.

You can also read and understand the SQL that generates insights for the [Profiles](./profiles.md), [Audiences](./audiences.md), and [Destinations](./destinations.md) dashboards.
